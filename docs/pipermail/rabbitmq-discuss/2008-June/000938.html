Morning Ben,

I'll try to reproduce it with a small test myself. The message &quot;Mnesia is
overloaded&quot; seems to hit sometimes when the message queue length is only
200,000 or so. Is this normal? Or perhaps the better questions is when does
Mnesia become overloaded? Does it need more disk or maybe more memory? Btw,
our queues are 'non-durable'.

&gt;<i> There is a *nicer* way to shut a client down, but at the end of the

</I>
Yeah, we could be polite to our clients and let them shutdown nicely but
because they're stateless we've always done it this way. If the patch isn't
available in time I can have a look into it.

Thanks,

Dave
