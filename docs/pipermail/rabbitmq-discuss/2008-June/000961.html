Hey Ben,

Unfortunately we're still able to crash it quite regularly. I changed the
message handlers to use only a single reply queue and now it's more stable
but not perfect. The only thing that still looks suspicious is that the
producers are sometimes run in threads. We only have one connection, which
is apparently thread safe (from the javadocs), and we create a channel for
each thread but maybe this is causing problems? We're going to make them
single threaded and keep testing.

I'm also going to upgrade everywhere to erlang 12b-3 to see if that helps.
I'll also apply the connection disconnect patch whenever it's available.
We're disconnecting nicely most of the time now but if you're debugging
then stopping the debugger causes a forced disconnect which causes an error
in the rabbitmq logs.

Thanks,

Dave
