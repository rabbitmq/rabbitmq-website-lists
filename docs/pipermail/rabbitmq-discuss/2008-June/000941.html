The messages themselves are not actually stored in mnesia. Mnesia just
maintains the existence of a queue with a unique name in a cluster.

The mnesia overloaded warning may indicate that there is a lot of
t-log activity caused by pending activities.

A good diagnostic for this is mnesia:info(). If we can get the remote
shell going, then the output of this would be good.

Furthermore having a script so that we can reproduce it here would be
good as well.

I also wondering why so many messages have been backed up. Can they
got get consumed at a fast rate?

</I>
The patch I was talking about neatens out the server side handling of
clients just going AWOL, but I don't think that is going to solve your
problem, which is what we need to get to the bottom of.
