Sorry, I'm confused myself. What happened is that one of the other
developers here said the all his clients had disconnected from rabbitmq.
The error on his screen was about no heartbeat for 3 seconds. I tried to
connect with a lightweight java client that just creates and deletes a
queue and I couldn't. It tried for a few seconds then died with
INTERNAL_ERROR in the exception reason. So I started writing an email to
the list. By the time I had finished the email people could connect to
RabbitMQ again. I haven't restarted it.

Does that sound normal? :)
