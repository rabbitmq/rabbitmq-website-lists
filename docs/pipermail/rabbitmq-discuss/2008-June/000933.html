<PRE>Hi Ben,

Thanks for the quick response. If you have a patch it would be great
because we're going live with rabbitmq in a few weeks. Unfortunately this
problem never showed up during my early tests and is only showing up now
that we're hitting it quite heavily in our dev environment.

Some of our code can produce 50,000 messages in a few minutes and it can
take half an hour to process them. During that time I guess other processes
could also be producing large amounts of messages. Each message can be up
to a few KB in size so it can be quite a bit of data.

I can't give you a simple test case now but I might be able to put one
together. RabbitMQ only dies about every week so it's hard to reproduce.
They way our code works is that a server sends up to 50,000 jobs (messages)
to a job queue. There are 40 consumers that read the jobs and process them
and send the results back to a temporary reply queue. So, no exchanges and
just 1 queue. If several people are using the same instance of RabbitMq,
which might happen, there might be a few queues but no more than 8 or so.

You're right about the clients, when we restart them we do it through a
kill -9 so they don't disconnect gracefully. It may seem strange but the
clients are stateless and lightweight and we've always killed them through
a kill -9.

The RabbitMQ process doesn't actually die. I'm nearly positive about that.
I checked before I did a restart and 'beam' was using lots of RAM and a
little CPU but nothing could connect.

Versions:
RabbitMQ 1.3.0-1
Ubuntu 8.04 amd64 with 4GB RAM
Erlang 1:11.b.5dfsg-11
OpenJDK 1.6.0_06-b02 64-bit

Thanks,

Dave

Dave,

I've had a quick look at the log file, and it seems that your clients
are dying, which in turn is badly handled in the broker.

This error

Error in process &lt;0.7321.2&gt; on node '<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at vsdlbblue01</A>' with exit
value: {badarg,[{erlang,port_command,[#Port&lt;0.27825&gt;,[&lt;&lt;7 bytes&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;36
bytes&gt;&gt;,&lt;&lt;1
byte&gt;&gt;]]},{rabbit_writer,internal_send_command_async,3},{rabbit_writer,handle_message,2},{rabbit_writer,mainloop,1}]}



suggests that the opposing peer is no longer there and causes a follow
on error message:

Error in process &lt;0.30205.1&gt; on node '<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at vsdlbblue01</A>' with exit
value:
{{badmatch,{error,[{exit,{timeout,{gen_server,call,[&lt;0.30206.1&gt;,{notify_down,&lt;0.30204.1&gt;}]}}}]}},[{rabbit_channel,terminate,2},{buffering_proxy,mainloop,4}]}


which is a symptom of the first error not being handled correctly.

There is a bug for this already and will be fixed very soon, please
let us know what the urgency on this is, because we could get a patch
out quicker if necessary.

This is not the complete answer though, which we'll look into, but I
just wanted to give some feedback as soon as possible.

A few questions to help us diagnose this:

- What version of Rabbit are you using?
- Does the Rabbit process actually die or just the TCP listener?

Thanks,

Ben
