<PRE>Thanks,

I've finally made a plugin to do that. I think what I wanted to do It
cannot be possible with mechanism you sent me in the email.

The plugin is here
<A HREF="https://github.com/flopezluis/rabbitmq-throttling-exchange,">https://github.com/flopezluis/rabbitmq-throttling-exchange,</A> It has a lot to
improve and certainly I'm not sure of the impact of this exchange in the
performance of rabbitmq.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the broker has a connection-based flow control mechanism - see

</I>&gt;<i> Bear in mind that blocking an Erlang process will lead to a backlog in
</I>&gt;<i> its internal mailbox without slowing down the network. Also, the
</I>&gt;<i> exchange is not a natural control point for bandwidth limiting, because
</I>&gt;<i> an exchange is not a process. A channel would be a more natural choice.
</I>&gt;<i> You may be able to adapt the existing flow control mechanism to grant
</I>&gt;<i> credits based on bandwidth rather than message count.

It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission


&quot;.....it doesn't matter how many times you fail. It doesn't matter how many
times you almost get it right. No one is going to know or care about your
failures, and either should you. All you have to do is learn from them and
those around you because...All that matters in business is that you get it
right once. Then everyone can tell you how lucky you are.&quot;
--Mark Cuban&quot;

&quot;Always be the worst guy in every band you're in.&quot; If you're the best guy
there, you need to be in a different band. And I think that works for
almost everything that's out there as well.&quot; Pat Metheny
