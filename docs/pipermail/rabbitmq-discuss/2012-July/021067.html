<PRE>New to RabbitMQ. I want do to high-availability over 2 machines. Do I make 
them both disk nodes or just 1? If just 1, but its disk fails, does the 
other one automatically become a &quot;disk node&quot;? If not, and I replace the 
failed-disk machine with a brand new machine with the same name (e.g. 
<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at server1</A>) and simply instruct it to join the cluster - will 
everything continue to work as if nothing happened? If not, which steps do 
I do to make it?

If I can't, then 2 disk nodes is the better solution, yes? And if I did 
that, is recovering from an abrupt failure of 1 of the machines simply to 
replace that machine, give it the same name (e.g. <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at server1</A>) and call 
the rabbitmqctl cluster command? Is that all I would have to do? If not, 
which steps do I do to get things back up fully?

I also have a 3rd machine running, which doesn't have any local web app 
software which creates or listens for any RabbitMQ messages. Would I 
benefit from using that as an additional (3rd) RabbitMQ node still? For 
example, the 3rd non-web-app machine as a disk node, and the 2 
web-app-clustered (which load-balance) machines as RAM nodes? And maybe 
have a RAID disk in the 3rd non-web-app machine. Is this the best solution 
of all? Last question, how do I recover after explicitly removing a disk 
node (i.e. not through disk failure, this in addition do the disk-failure 
question)?
