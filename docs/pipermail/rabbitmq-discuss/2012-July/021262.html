No problem. I am putting the list back on cc...

A few questions:

- the .tar.gz looks a bit odd in that all the files in it are themselves 
compressed. Please confirm that you did that yourself and just for 
sending me the data - if the filesystem actually had all the files 
compressed then things would certainly go wrong.

- there appear to be *two* mnesia base dirs - one in 
/var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia, and one in /home/rabbit/db. Which one are you 
using? I suspect it's the latter since it has more recent timestamps.

- with the exact mnesia dirs you sent, what error do you get when 
starting rabbit?
