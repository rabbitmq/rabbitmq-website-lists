<PRE>Hi Francesco, thanks for your answer (howcome it isn't showing up in this 
google group)? Can you give me an example of a durable resource 
creation/deletion operation that would benefit from a RAM node (so that I 
know what that means)? If I do have a lot of these, then would I benefit 
from using the 3rd (non-wep-app) machine as a RAM node, along with the 2 
(relevant web app containing) disc nodes? Also, how do I approximately 
calculate the maximum disk space the disc nodes may possibly need in the 
very worst case scenario, say when there are 1 Mb/s of messages?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that should work.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, that should be OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also have a 3rd machine running, which doesn't have any local web app

&gt;&gt;<i> from using that as an additional (3rd) RabbitMQ node still? For example, 
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> 3rd non-web-app machine as a disk node, and the 2 web-app-clustered 
</I>(which
&gt;&gt;<i> load-balance) machines as RAM nodes? And maybe have a RAID disk in the

&gt;&gt;<i> non-web-app machine. Is this the best solution of all? Last question,

&gt;&gt;<i> recover after explicitly removing a disk node (i.e. not through disk

&gt;&gt;<i> this in addition do the disk-failure question)?

</I>Everything else

&gt;<i> transient on disc nodes too.
