<PRE>Ivan,

This is a very good question. However, I'm bound to say it is not really
a RabbitMQ question.

A full answer would occupy a book (and indeed, you can find books on
this subject) and boil down to analysing:

a) what do you mean by 'best'?  That is, precisely what are your goals?
b) what really matters to you? That is, precisely what are your
   requirements?

These can have so many answers it is not possible to say what
arrangement is 'best'. I'll just give a small selection of problem
differentiators:

1. what size requests? (what is 'pretty large'??)
2. what size replies?
3. are there server/application affinity rules?
4. are the requests transactional? serialised?
5. are there response guarantees? what are they?
6. what message rate? variability?
7. what service rate? variability?
8. what hardware?

I recommend you go find a good book. I could be wrong but you probably
won't find any definitive answers on a forum like this.

Good luck,
Steve Powell  (a happy bunny)
