<PRE>Definitely I would like to extend the flow control mechanism to support
something similar as I've done with plugin, so someone can set a maximum
messages per second or something similar

2012/7/30 Tim Watson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">tim at rabbitmq.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i>  Just to add to Emile's comments, I there are a couple of things to
</I>&gt;<i> consider here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, it's important to point out that letting the Channel process
</I>&gt;<i> mailbox fill up could lead to unexpected and unpredictable performance
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics, and doesn't appear to offer anything that per-connection
</I>&gt;<i> flow control isn't already doing. Also, creating an mnesia transaction for
</I>&gt;<i> each routing operation is likely to produce an altogether *different* kind
</I>&gt;<i> of throttling of Rabbit's performance across a cluster, and probably (in
</I>&gt;<i> fact, almost certainly) not the one you intended.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would strongly recommend reconsidering this approach. If you're
</I>&gt;<i> interested in extending the flow control mechanism to support alternative
</I>&gt;<i> measures, then perhaps we should have a collective conversation about that
</I>&gt;<i> instead, as Emile is quite right in suggesting that approach makes more
</I>&gt;<i> sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Tim

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, the broker has a connection-based flow control mechanism - see

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and a blog post that explains further:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bear in mind that blocking an Erlang process will lead to a backlog in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its internal mailbox without slowing down the network. Also, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchange is not a natural control point for bandwidth limiting, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an exchange is not a process. A channel would be a more natural choice.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You may be able to adapt the existing flow control mechanism to grant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> credits based on bandwidth rather than message count.
