<PRE>===========================================
 Celery 3.0 (Chiastic Slide) Released!
===========================================

Celery is a simple, flexible and reliable distributed system to
process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with
the tools required to maintain such a system.

It's a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also
supporting task scheduling.

Celery has a large and diverse community of users and contributors,
you should come join us on IRC (freenode.net: #celery)
or our mailing-list (<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/celery-users">http://groups.google.com/group/celery-users</A>).

To read more about Celery you should go read the introduction:
  - <A HREF="http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/introduction.html">http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/introduction.html</A>

If you use Celery in combination with Django you must also
read the django-celery changelog and upgrade to django-celery 3.0
  - <A HREF="http://github.com/celery/django-celery/tree/master/Changelog">http://github.com/celery/django-celery/tree/master/Changelog</A>

This version is officially supported on CPython 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3,
as well as PyPy and Jython.

/*
You should read the full changelog which contains important notes at:

    - <A HREF="http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/whatsnew-3.0.html">http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/whatsnew-3.0.html</A>
*/

Highlights
==========

- A new and improved API, that is both simpler and more powerful.

    Everyone must read the new &quot;first-steps&quot; tutorial,
    and the new &quot;next-steps&quot; tutorial

      - <A HREF="http://bit.ly/celery-first-steps">http://bit.ly/celery-first-steps</A>
      - <A HREF="http://bit.ly/celery-next-steps">http://bit.ly/celery-next-steps</A>

    Oh, and why not reread the user guide while you're at it :)

    There are no current plans to deprecate the old API,
    so you don't have to be in a hurry to port your applications.

- The worker is now thread-less, giving great performance improvements.

- The new &quot;Canvas&quot; makes it easy to define complex workflows.

    Ever wanted to chain tasks together? This is possible, but
    not just that, now you can even chain together groups and chords,
    or even combine multiple chains.

    Read more in the Canvas user guide:
      - <A HREF="http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/canvas.html">http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/canvas.html</A>

- All of Celery's command line programs are now available from a single
    umbrella command: ``celery``.

- This is the last version to support Python 2.5.

    Starting with Celery 3.1, Python 2.6 or later is required.

- Support for the new librabbitmq C client.

    Celery will automatically use the librabbitmq module
    if installed, which is a very fast and memory-optimized
    replacement for the amqplib module.

- Redis support is more reliable with improved ack emulation.

- Celery now always uses UTC

- Over 600 commits, 30k additions/36k deletions.

    In comparison 1.0 to 2.0 had 18k additions/8k deletions.

Thank you to all users and contributors!
