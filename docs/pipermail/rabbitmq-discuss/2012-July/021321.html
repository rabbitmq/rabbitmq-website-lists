<PRE>Hi Simon,

&gt;<i> At one point we believed that the standard Erlang TCP implementation was not fast enough. hstcp was an attempt to get TCP to go faster.
</I>
OK I see.

&gt;<i> However, recent improvements to our use of the standard Erlang TCP implementation have improved Rabbit's performance to the point where hstcp doesn't gain anything, so we're abandoning hstcp.
</I>
Are these improvements documented somewhere?
Even source files I can have look into.

Regards,
Zabrane
