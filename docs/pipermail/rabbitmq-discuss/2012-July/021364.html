...and the changes:

a) Came in a bit at a time over several releases.
b) Vary in benefit hugely depending on message size (and to a lesser 
extent on other things).

As a one-off example, on my machine (Dell Precision T3500), single 
producer, single consumer with no acks or persistence, I get end to end:

RabbitMQ 2.8.0, 100 byte messages: ~27,000 msg/s
RabbitMQ 2.8.4, 100 byte messages: ~29,000 msg/s

RabbitMQ 2.8.0, 100 kilobyte messages: ~1,200 msg/s
RabbitMQ 2.8.4, 100 kilobyte messages: ~4,200 msg/s

So that's either a 7% improvement or a 250% improvement. Your pick.

Note that we started on the latest round of reader tuning before 2.8.0, 
but that's the first version that's easy to benchmark due to flow control.

But as usual, the moral is: There Are Tons Of Variables, Do Your Own 
Testing :-)

Cheers, Simon
