</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [rabbitmq-discuss] Erlang Client Changes Since 2.2.0?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Erm, no. And you'll be delighted to hear that some more API changes are
</I>&gt;<i> in the pipeline too...
</I>
I see them!  I'm happy to see the Erlang client continues to grow up.

&gt;<i> &gt; You do a great job with this with the java and .net clients, but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't see the analog for the erlang client.  There are a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commits in the hg repo since that time of 2.2.0, but I'd love to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to just skim past them...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, the problem is that the Erlang client &quot;is not yet a supported
</I>&gt;<i> client&quot;. It's very close to being there though: beyond the upcoming
</I>&gt;<i> changes there's not much more that's in store for it and so it should
</I>&gt;<i> enter a more stable period a la the Java and .Net clients.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If there is no such summary, is there anything I should know up-front
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about the changes?
</I>
&gt;<i> I can't remember the state of things in 2.2.0!
</I>
In 2.2.0 the connection:start methods had already been refactored between direct and network, functions generally returned standard erlang return values, but the error messages weren't all that consistent yet.

&gt;<i> Things like amqp_connection:start and :open_channel now return {ok,
</I>&gt;<i> Thing} rather than just Thing. The main changes have been dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> errors in a consistent and predictable way. Without working through all
</I>&gt;<i> the bugs myself, I'm not really able to produce a summary. Possibly one
</I>&gt;<i> sane way of finding out what's changed is to look at the merges to
</I>&gt;<i> default of something like the shovel, which is really just a program
</I>&gt;<i> using the erlang client and is also entirely in maintanance mode. Thus
</I>&gt;<i> changes that have affected the shovel are also likely to affect you.
</I>
The shovel tip was a good one, thanks for that!

Between reading the shovel changes and the changes in the erlang-client repo itself, I see these highlights:

* Several internal cleanups and a few bug fixes
* Support for publisher confirms
* Better error messages sent back to the parent pid (brought to us by link() instead of monitor(), I think)

Does it sound like enough of the basic picture?

Thanks!

-Chris
