<PRE>Good day,

While writing some code using the Ruby AMQP gem against RabbitMQ, I've
noticed that if I publish a message and quickly close the connection, even
though I've received a publish-ok response from the server, the message
fails to be queued by the broker.

The code in question looks like:

require 'amqp'
EM.run do
  client   = AMQP.connect(:host =&gt; '127.0.0.1')
  channel  = AMQP::Channel.new(client)
  channel.on_error { puts 'channel error'; EM.stop }
  exchange = channel.topic 'foo',:durable =&gt; true
  exchange.publish( 'hello world', :routing_key =&gt; &quot;some_topic&quot;, :persistent
=&gt; true, :nowait =&gt; false ) { puts 'publish-ok'; EM.stop }
end

I should clarify that there is a binding in place to route messages with
routing_key &quot;some_topic&quot; to the a queue on the &quot;foo&quot; exchange.

If I remove the EM.stop call in the publish-ok callback, allowing the
connection to exist after the publish, then I the message is queued.

Is this expected behavior?

I would expect that if the broker has responded with a publish-ok, then
regardless of what happens to the connection from that point forward, it
will do its best to deliver that message to a queue.
