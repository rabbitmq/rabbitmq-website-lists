</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have to send control messages to 50 or 60 machines deployed around the world, so they can subscribe to some message types and then perform some actions. Maybe some machines will be grouped in small clusters of 4-5 machines, and some tasks can be run by any machine in that group, but there will also be some tasks that will be targeted to some specific machines. There should be a very low traffic, with maybe just a couple of messages per second, so I was planning to use a simple architecture, with one central broker.

My question is, could I keep this simple architecture or will I need something a bit more complicated like rabbitmq with xmpp or shovel? I have not found many docs about using RabbitMQ on WANs, so maybe nobody is crazy enough for trying this... maybe I should not use RabbitMQ at all?  :)

Hi Matthew,

I didn't plan to use MCollective but our own custom framework, built with Python/Celery/RabbitMQ. Our infrastructure will impose some tight requirements, as we have machines all around the globe and latencies can become a big problem, but I think we can live with it as long as we don&#180;t need a high throughput (or many synchronous operations).  And regarding the security, I&#180;m also interested this: my plan is to deploy our systems with the SSL module...

Cheers



Alvaro
