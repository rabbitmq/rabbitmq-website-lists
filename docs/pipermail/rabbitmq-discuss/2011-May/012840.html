Clustering is unlikely to work well over a WAN because Erlang's
clustering (specifically mnesia) doesn't cope well with recovery from
partitions.

Shovel is an alternative but can only do static configuration. If you
have, or can arrange at the boundaries between your two systems, a fixed
number of queues then the shovel can work well. However, note that with
clustering, you have one logical broker. With shovel, you do not: you
have two distinct brokers.
