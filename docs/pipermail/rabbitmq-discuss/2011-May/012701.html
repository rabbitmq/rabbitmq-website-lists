I'm not at all familiar with the Ruby client, but I should point out 
that unlike many of the other AMQP methods, basic.publish does not have 
a corresponding basic.publish-ok method; it's always asynchronous. So I 
imagine the post-publish callback fires immediately.

In order to be able to know when the broker has taken responsibility for 
a message you can either wrap the publish in a transaction (when you see 
tx.commit-ok you know the server has the message) or use the rather more 
lightweight publish confirms:

...but I'm not sure if they are supported by the Ruby gem yet (Jakub, 
can you comment?)

Cheers, Simon
