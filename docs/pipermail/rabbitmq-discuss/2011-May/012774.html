Yes it is possible, but only if the threads use the same channel.

&gt;<i> More generally can I use a channel from a different thread?
</I>
Yes, but you will need to synchronise access to the channel appropriately.

&gt;<i> I think I read that you should not use a channel simulatenously across
</I>&gt;<i> threads?
</I>
Indeed. Avoid this if possible. You risk introducing races and protocol 
framing errors.
