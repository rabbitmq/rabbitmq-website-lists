<PRE>Michael,

apologies for the delay in getting back to you...

Interesting. Distribution of DB change notifications seems to be an 
increasingly popular RabbitMQ application.

&gt;<i> My first thought was to create an exchange for each observed database

</I>&gt;<i> couchdb_changes.db1 ... couchdb_changes.db10).  A routing key would

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My second thought was that I could create a single exchange named

</I>&gt;<i> When binding queues to the exchange the application would also

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, are there advantages or disadvantages between the two approaches

</I>&gt;<i> decisions.
</I>
I can think of two main criteria to guide your decision here:

1) Is the set of DB names fairly static, or does it change quite often? 
In the one-exchange-per-db model the list of exchanges need to be kept 
in sync with the list of databases, which might be tricky depending on 
how/when the list changes.

2) What kind of subscriptions do you want to support, i.e. how do 
consumers narrow the event stream down to what they want to receive? A 
single topic exchange would give you the most flexibility here, but a 
set of direct exchanges will perform better in most cases.


Regards,

Matthias.
