Hi Greg.

The next release will contain a simple tracer. When turned on it sends 
information about each publish and each delivery to a special exchange. 
At the moment there's nothing to log such messages but it wouldn't be 
hard to write one and I'll probably add something to mgmt at some point.

There's also the tracer in the Java client since forever, but that's a 
bit fiddly to set up and quite low-level.

Cheers, Simon
