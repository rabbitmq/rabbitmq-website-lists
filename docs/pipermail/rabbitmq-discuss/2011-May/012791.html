True. I don't think this is quite the right place for such questions
though - but there's nothing better atm. Whilst I am on erlang-questions
too, I don't really pay it much attention.

If people would like me to set up an erlando mailing list, just email
_me_ directly a &quot;yes&quot;, and I'll see what I can do.

&gt;<i>, I thought I'd ask here. I'm trying to digest the new README on github
</I>&gt;<i>and wondered: is the cut transform kind of like currying?
</I>
Yes, and it does say that right at the start of the README. Strictly, in
my mind partial application and currying are two different things.

(Sorry, I have to drop into Haskell here, otherwise the difference is
less clear.) Partial application is when you do

 f = (+) 5

and thus end up with f :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a

The key thing is that you're partially applying the arguments in the
order that the occur specified by the function.

Currying, however, is the relationship between a function that takes,
say, 2 arguments, and a function that takes 1 argument which is a tuple
of 2 elements. So in Haskell, we have:

curry :: ((a, b) -&gt; c) -&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; c

I.e. give it a function that takes a tuple, and it'll make it look like
a function that takes 2 args; and the opposite, uncurry:

uncurry :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a, b) -&gt; c

I.e. give it a function that takes 2 args, and it'll make it look like a
function that takes a tuple.

In languages where parenthesis are required to distinguish between
functions and their arguments (i.e. not Haskell), this all looks a bit
messier.

Most people use currying and partial application interchangably.

Cuts are similar but actually a little more powerful as they allow you
to create holes _before_ known arguments rather than just after. E.g.

 F = wibble(_, 12, _),

which you can't do with partial application, as you can only partially
apply args left to right.
