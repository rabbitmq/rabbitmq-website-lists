<PRE>Hi,

We are starting to use RabbitMQ and would like to have our projects configured for continuous integration testing using an embedded broker within the JVM.  Does RabbitMQ have something similar to the ActiveMQ one: <A HREF="http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-embed-a-broker-inside-a-connection.html?">http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-embed-a-broker-inside-a-connection.html?</A>  Also, is there a plugin that can boot up the broker similar to this: <A HREF="http://activemq.apache.org/maven2-activemq-broker-plugin.html?">http://activemq.apache.org/maven2-activemq-broker-plugin.html?</A>

I have reviewed the online content but have not been able to find anything.

Kind Regards,
Linley Smith
