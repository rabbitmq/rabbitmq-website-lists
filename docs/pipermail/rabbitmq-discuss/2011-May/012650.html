</I>Indeed. Maintaining the map at the queue level prevents the consumer 
getting overwhelmed with messages, which is kind of the point last-value 
in the first place. E.g. you may have a stock ticker app which only 
updates every second. It doesn't want to be flooded by millions of ticks 
it can't handle.

LVC exchange seems to be handling a somewhat different use-case 
sometimes known as &quot;value + updates&quot;, where you're interested in syncing 
with some state machine (i.e. obtain current state), and also interested 
in getting all updates on that state from then on, so you can maintain a 
replica of that state machine. That's a common and valid use case, but 
not the same as the last-value queue case.

If you were so inclined, you could transform the &quot;value+updates&quot; case 
into the &quot;last-value-queue&quot; case by taking the  values+updates and 
maintaining a map yourself on the client-side to weed out &quot;old&quot; entries 
(as someone else mentioned), but this is a) extra work for you to do b) 
burns lots of bandwidth + cpu in sending unwanted messages to the 
client, and c) your client may still not be able to keep up with the 
firehose anyway.
