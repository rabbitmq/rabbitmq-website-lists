<PRE>Hi,

 

I have an application that will send and receive messages to Users
associated with Groups. Each Group is independent will have 5 to 10
users associated.

 

The Users, Client applications, will send commands to the server
application that will execute it and return a response (typical async
RPC). The server application will push to Users and to the Groups
relevant informations.

 

I am thinking about what could be the best architecture:

 

1)      For each User one  Command Queue where the Client applications
will send the commands and one Response Queue where the User will
receive the response sent by the server;

2)      For each User one Information Queue where the Server will push
informations specific to the user;

3)      For each Group one Information Queue where the Server will push
informations specific to the Group. In this case all users of this group
will receive the informations published in this queue;

 

My concern is that if I have 30 groups and 6 users per group I will have
180 users and considering the architecture above I will have 540 queues
(30*3) for Users and 30 queues for the Groups. Does it sound OK or too
much for RabbitMQ.

 

I could have, instead of this, another architecture that could use
topics exchanges. Each user could publish and receive commands and
informations using a topic: group.user. This way I could have this:

 

1)      For each Group one  Command Queue where the Client applications
will send the commands and one Response Queue where the User will
receive the response sent by the server;

2)      For each Group one Information Queue where the Server will push
informations specific to the Group. In this case all users of this group
will receive the informations published in this queue;

 

This will  lead me to 90 Queues (30*3) for Users and 30 Queues for
Groups.

 

Which one is the better ??? 

Thanks in advance
