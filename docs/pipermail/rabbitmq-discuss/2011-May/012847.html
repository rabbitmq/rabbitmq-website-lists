Erm, no. And you'll be delighted to hear that some more API changes are
in the pipeline too...

Yeah, the problem is that the Erlang client &quot;is not yet a supported
client&quot;. It's very close to being there though: beyond the upcoming
changes there's not much more that's in store for it and so it should
enter a more stable period a la the Java and .Net clients.

&gt;<i> If there is no such summary, is there anything I should know up-front

</I>
I can't remember the state of things in 2.2.0!

Things like amqp_connection:start and :open_channel now return {ok,
Thing} rather than just Thing. The main changes have been dealing with
errors in a consistent and predictable way. Without working through all
the bugs myself, I'm not really able to produce a summary. Possibly one
sane way of finding out what's changed is to look at the merges to
default of something like the shovel, which is really just a program
using the erlang client and is also entirely in maintanance mode. Thus
changes that have affected the shovel are also likely to affect you.

Best wishes,

Matthew
