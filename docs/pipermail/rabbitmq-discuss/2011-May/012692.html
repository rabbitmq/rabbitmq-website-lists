<PRE>I haven't looked at RhinoServiceBus, my inspiration is mainly MassTransit. Agreed that the new version is looking really nice.

Never looked at Rhino but I have taken some inspiration from MassTransit and NServiceBus.  The new version of MassTransit is looking pretty good, *and* it sounds like they are working on real honest-to-god integration with RabbitMQ which is GREAT.  We run our services under mono and MSMQ is simply not an option and I won't touch ActiveMQ with a 10 foot pole.
