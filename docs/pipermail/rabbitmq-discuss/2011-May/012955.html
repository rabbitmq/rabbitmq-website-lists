The overridden versions of BasicConsume that don't take noAck do set it 
to false.

The release notes are posted to the rabbitmq-announce mailing list:

<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-announce">https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-announce</A>

and are available archived from our news page:

<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/news.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/news.html</A>

Highlights for each release are summarised at the changelog:

<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html</A>

 &gt; &quot;The consumer tag is local to a channel&quot; -- so we're talking about
 &gt; identifying one consumer, of many listenning in to a single channel?

Yes, to allow you to:

* Know which messages arrived for which consumer.

* Cancel an individual consumer.

NB: the consumer tag always exists, the server will; generate one for 
you if you don't provide one.

 &gt; If we've got a field/tag for a particular consumer (even one on the same
 &gt; channel), perhaps it'd be nice to have a publisher-tag as well.  i.e.
 &gt; issolate a particular publisher for tracing purposes.  reply-to merely
 &gt; distinguishes the queue.

The trouble is that AMQP 0-9-1 doesn't require you to declare a 
&quot;publisher&quot; in the same way that you do a consumer (maybe it should) - 
so it's not clear where this would live.

 &gt; Maybe I could use &quot;IDictionary arguments&quot; could be used for this
 &gt; instead?  I've ignored &quot;arguments&quot; up until now.

If you want to identify a particular publisher, the canonical way to do 
that is with the &quot;app-id&quot; property in BasicProperties.

Cheers, Simon
