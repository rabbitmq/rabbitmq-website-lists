Thanks.

It pains me to say it, but I suspect the management plugin to be the 
source of most of your problems. Currently it doesn't deal very well 
with large numbers (many thousands) of queues, all of which are active 
at once, or with very high rates of connection / channel churn. 
Switching off fine grained statistics helps quite a bit, but it's still 
not as good as it should be.

Coincidentally I've been doing some work in this area (inspired by Ian 
Ragsdale's recent postings), some of which is starting to bear fruit, so 
hopefully this sort of scenario will improve in the relatively short term...

Cheers, Simon
