If you are going for a central broker model you should be fine. The 
discussions that we've had about network partitioning and use of the 
shovel to mitigate it have all been about clustering over a WAN, which 
is not recommended. But AMQP over WAN is fine.

Obviously synchronous methods will be slow when latency is slow 
(although no worse than e.g. HTTP would be), but with low traffic like 
that you probably don't even care.

Cheers, Simon
