<PRE>It is a little hard to say for sure just from the information in the log;
however it looks like that first subscription (on the exchange
&quot;NodeJsNotification&quot;) is getting deleted for legitimate reasons. The
subscription could get deleted as a consequence of the endpoint becoming
unavailable, or due to the lease expiring, or it could have been explicitly
deleted via an unsubscribe request. I do not believe that the lease has
expired, but there's not really enough information to say which of the
other two options might have caused the subscription to get deleted.

There is also some funny stuff in the log (which may or may not be relevant
to tracking down the problem). It looks like you register to the exchange
&quot;NodeJsNotification&quot; several times using the same callback URL, which
causes RabbitHub to report &quot;duplicates&quot;. This is not a problem. I can then
see your initial subscription to a queue with a nice long name, and not
long afterwards I see the subscription to the queue get terminated, most
likely because you have deleted the queue (as per your email). There are
then a whole pile of errors indicating that you are trying to subscribe to
the queue that has just been deleted (queue_not_found errors). As I say,
these details are not related to the &quot;NodeJsNotification&quot; subscription
getting deleted, but these observations may help to narrow down what is
going on.
