<PRE>Cameron, 
                  Thanks for your effort. 
I replaced rabbithub from the location you mentioned. 
Now, while enabling rabbithub, no issue raised. it enabled mochiweb plugin along with it.

But after that, when i tried to restart the rabbitmq-server to apply changes, it Failed to start. throws error.

attached is the complete log files archive as per request.

Lijo,


I suspect that the binary you downloaded was not the most up to date, and there have been some additional refinements (fixes) that are probably relevant. I have just uploaded a fresh build of rabbithub-3.1.5.ez  to the same location (same link) which - based on a couple of quick tests - appears to work with RabbitMQ 3.2.0/3.2.1. I'll give it a more thorough test tomorrow and maybe see about creating a 3.2.0/3.2.1 release, but you might like to give this new build a spin and see what happens... and if you encounter errors, please post relevant sections of the RabbitMQ log file(s).


Brett

  Cameron, 
                      I tried with your option RabbitHub, and encountered with some issues.

  System Specifications:
  Erlang Version : RB16B02 (5.10.3)
  RabbitMQ Server Version : 3.2.0

  I downloaded rabbithub from github, added in Plugins folder, tried to enable but 
  &quot;The specified component was not found: rabbitmq_mochiweb&quot; error occured.

  I searched my plugins folder, found mochiweb-2.7.0-rmq3.2.0-git680dba8.ez. But, enabling that does not solved my issue.

  Hence i searched for rabbitmq_mochiweb and found it from here. (<A HREF="https://github.com/simoneb/Roger/blob/master/RabbitMQServer/plugins/rabbitmq_mochiweb-2.7.1.ez">https://github.com/simoneb/Roger/blob/master/RabbitMQServer/plugins/rabbitmq_mochiweb-2.7.1.ez</A>)

  Also from your posts in other sites, i took the latest released rabbithub-3.1.5 (<A HREF="https://region-a.geo-1.objects.hpcloudsvc.com/v1/66395568832599/RabbitHub/rabbithub-3.1.5.ez">https://region-a.geo-1.objects.hpcloudsvc.com/v1/66395568832599/RabbitHub/rabbithub-3.1.5.ez</A>).

  Everything works fine. I was able to enable these plugins.

  but when i tried to create a queue using the followng curl command, 
  $ curl -v -X PUT <A HREF="http://guest:guest@localhost:55670/endpoint/q/foo">http://guest:guest@localhost:55670/endpoint/q/foo</A> ,
  I got the following error.


  * timeout on name lookup is not supported
  * About to connect() to localhost port 55670 (#0)
  *   Trying 127.0.0.1...
  * Connection refused
  * couldn't connect to host
  * Closing connection #0
  curl: (7) couldn't connect to host

  When i checked my server, it was stopped. I restarted and did the same. Same issue happens. 
  RabbitMQ Server is getting crashed with these steps. 

  What am i wrong here?
  Could you please provide some information regarding this issue?

  Lijo,


  Possibly RabbitHub (<A HREF="https://github.com/brc859844/rabbithub">https://github.com/brc859844/rabbithub</A> has been tested up to RabbitMQ 3.1.5) might do part of what you want?

    Videla,  

                     Our requirement is like that. For security purposes, we do all incoming requests like this. nginx will redirect to the specified api or a webpage or anything.
                    What we need here is a messaging protocol that supports Publish/Subscribe mechanism, that connects to server through nginx proxy pass.
                    ave tried mqtt, xmpp etc. but they does not supports this http bridging.H
                    Please let me know if this is possible with RabbitMQ, or any other MQ protocols.

    Lijo,

    Why do you need to have nginx in front of your RabbitMQ server? 

    Why do you need to publish messages over HTTP?

    Also, may I ask. Have you read and followed the tutorials offered on the website? <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html</A>

    The tutorials will give you a good understanding of what RabbitMQ and AMQP can do.

    Regards,

    Alvaro

        i have a scenario where my c# application should send/receive messages from server.
               But an nginx server will proxy pass the connection with default port 80 in between.

      You cannot use Nginx to proxy HTTP traffic to port 5672
      because HTTP and AMQP 0-9-1 are very different protocols.
