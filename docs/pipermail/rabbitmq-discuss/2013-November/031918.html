Apart from the fact that this would violate a number of security principles, it's possible but not without writing a custom plugin. I have considered writing a plugin that listens for management events describing &quot;schema changes&quot; (i.e., CRUD operations on users, vhosts, queues, exchanges, etc) that publishes this information to an exchange and binds a queue to it. The user (installing the plugin) would need to ensure this is &quot;locked down&quot; to prevent security holes from appearing as a result. I hadn't considered adding connect+disconnect events though, because (a) these could be extremely frequent and could harm performance, plus (b) I can't quite see why such information would be useful. One of the primary reasons for using messaging oriented middleware is to de-couple producers from consumers, whereas providing a stream of schema-oriented information seems quite useful if you're working with dynamically changing topologies. Perhaps from a statistics monitoring point of view the connect/disconnect information is useful, but you can get that by polling the management HTTP API already, and I'm not sure whether adding a queue based feed would be the best way to present an alternative interface to such information. Simon may well have more/better points to add on this.

Cheers,
Tim
