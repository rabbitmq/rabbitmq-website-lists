Standard exchange types are not message containers. They are routing tables and if there are no bindings,
one of the following will happen:

 * Messages published as mandatory will be returned to the client
 * Exchanges that have alternate exchange configured will republish the message there.
 * Message will be dropped.

Exchange durability controls whether it will exist after broker restart.
