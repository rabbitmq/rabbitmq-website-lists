<PRE>Hi all,

I'd like to make a first announcement for something I've been working - 
Sneakers.
You can check it out at 

<A HREF="http://sneakers.io">http://sneakers.io</A>

or have a read at the wiki <A HREF="https://github.com/jondot/sneakers/wiki">https://github.com/jondot/sneakers/wiki</A>
code is at <A HREF="https://github.com/jondot/sneakers">https://github.com/jondot/sneakers</A>



Since I already built a framework targeted at JRuby 
(<A HREF="https://github.com/jondot/frenzy_bunnies">https://github.com/jondot/frenzy_bunnies</A>) that's rock solid at production 
for over a year now, this time the requirement was to create a simple, 
performant, framework that would work well on CRuby (the Ruby that we all 
know) that allows the use of gems with C-Extensions (unlike JRuby).

I've added a &quot;why i built it&quot; section at the 
wiki <A HREF="https://github.com/jondot/sneakers/wiki/Why-i-built-it">https://github.com/jondot/sneakers/wiki/Why-i-built-it</A> which will 
provide the reasoning for a new framework, and how it's contrasted against 
existing frameworks.

All in all, I hope to get some developer feedback, ease of use and API 
feedback from you all.
As always I'm accepting pull requests happily :)



Today, Sneakers is run in production for 2 of my own projects doing 
Facebook-centric scraping/API calls, and at work doing real time event 
processing (which includes considerable I/O).

On a personal note, this was a project that should have ended in a couple 
of weekends but took around 2 month worth of weekends because I really 
wanted to simplify and streamline every bit, and more importantly because 
of some sad lessons life decided to teach me. Eventually, it is done, but 
before anything else I really am hoping to hear what you guys think.


Thanks,
Dotan, @jondot
