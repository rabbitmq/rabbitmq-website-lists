<PRE>It's not usual to send out of office notifications to a public, subscribed mailing list. Just so you know.

As a native English speaker, I'd also like to point a few small grammatical issues with your mail, which I hope you will find informative and helpful! :)

&gt;<i> Due to Diwali Festival, SLS will be closed from Oct. 31th to Nov. 6th.
</I>
Since Diwali is a specific festival, you should add the &quot;definite article&quot; in front of it: A definite article indicates that its noun (in this case, the Festival Diwali) is a particular one identifiable to the listener. With that in place, your opening sentence should read:

&quot;Due to the Diwali Festival, SLS will be closed from ....&quot;

Since SLS is not closing because of Diwali, but rather is closed for Diwali (since it is considered appropriate to give employees a day off to celebrate this important festival, a human being's action caused the closure), a more idiomatically correct reading would be:

&quot;SLS will be closed between Oct. 31st and Nov. 6th, for the Diwali Festival.&quot;

Note that the thirty-first day of the month (or indeed, any something-first day of the month) should be abbreviated with &quot;st&quot; rather than &quot;th&quot;, as per the correct pronunciation. I've used &quot;between&quot; here rather than &quot;from .. to&quot;, though either is fine as would &quot;from Oct. 31st until Nov. 6th&quot;. 

&gt;<i> We will return on Nov. 7th to the office. For urgent matter please call on 001-408-852-0067.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
In the latter sentence, it would be more natural to use the plural, rendering &quot;For urgent matters, please call ....&quot; 

&gt;<i> For more information about Diwali:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That's good introduction to a fascinating festival. Thanks for sharing that information and I hope all concerned have a wonderful time!

I hope my feedback has been useful!

Kind regards,

Tim Watson
