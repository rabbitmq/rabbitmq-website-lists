</I>&gt;&gt;<i> validation in a minor release, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So there are two ways to fix this. Ultimately I think we want to do both:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Prevent AMQP (and STOMP and...) clients from sending badly-formed
</I>&gt;<i> strings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Deal with such strings in mgmt if they are already there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We need this belt-and-braces approach since there are quite a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> ways badly-formed strings could get into the broker (indeed the OP was
</I>&gt;<i> using the UDP exchange).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We currently have a work in progress for 1) (which would not get
</I>&gt;<i> released until 3.3.0 since it could break weird clients). I was
</I>&gt;<i> planning on working on 2) at some point and releasing it in a bugfix
</I>&gt;<i> release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if you want to contribute 2) instead that would help it happen
</I>&gt;<i> faster. I'm not convinced that percent-encoding is the right thing to
</I>&gt;<i> do though; certainly I don't think it lets you get round-trip access
</I>&gt;<i> to things with badly formed names. If you plan on un-encoding strings
</I>&gt;<i> as they come in to let that happen then all clients need to know this
</I>&gt;<i> is how we work, otherwise they could send a string which is malformed
</I>&gt;<i> from the POV of percent-encoding. Suddenly we don't speak normal JSON
</I>&gt;<i> / URLs any more (and URL bits get percent encoded twice!)
</I>I'd like to imagine that a client would just send back the string from
the JSON with appropriate encoding; but then again, my years of dealing
with the web tells me that is wildly optimistic.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it only goes one way then that's more workable - but you still have
</I>&gt;<i> the double-percent-encoding thing, which is not very loveable. How do
</I>&gt;<i> you distinguish &quot;myqueue%80%80&quot; which is the result of a badly-formed
</I>&gt;<i> name from &quot;myqueue%80%80&quot; which just happens to be called that?
</I>You'd need to include '%' in the set of things that are escaped, so you
end up with &quot;myqueue%2580%2580&quot;, which looks pretty fugly. But you're
right that there's a big risk of breaking things unexpectedly. As for
clients that consume the Management API, I know of Michael Klishin's
Ruby code and of course the management UI javascript, on top of the
approach of using using a plain HTTP client with string interpolation to
construct URLs. Do you know of any others?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would just swap in U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also bear in mind that this doesn't just happen with object names,
</I>&gt;<i> basic.properties, arguments and so on can all contain badly-formed
</I>&gt;<i> strings.
</I>You're right; it's potentially quite a rabbit hole.

&gt;<i> Apologies if any of the above is grandmother-sucking-eggs territory.
</I>I honestly can't imagine that sucking eggs has anywhere as many wierd
corner cases as character encodings on the web :)
