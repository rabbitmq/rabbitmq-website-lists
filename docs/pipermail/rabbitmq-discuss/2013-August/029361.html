<PRE>Hi Emile, thank you for your reply to my query.

&gt;<i> If you want an end-to-end proof of delivery from the consumer then you
</I>&gt;<i> must set up an independent line of communication between the consumer
</I>&gt;<i> and the producer and send a proof-of-delivery token back along that route.
</I>&lt;
&gt;<i> Depending on your needs you may wish to make consumer acknowledgements
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous by acknowledging in a transaction before sending the
</I>&gt;<i> proof-of-delivery.
</I>
Here's how I think I may implement the end to end delivery reporting.

For my case, I'll be running multiple threads and producers, connecting to a
RabbitMQ cluster of 2 servers.  Each producer will subscribe to a distinct
&quot;ack&quot; queue to receive acknowledgements for messages they sent.  The
consumer will need to know which &quot;ack&quot; queue to send the acknowledgement.

By &quot;transaction&quot;, would you be referring to STOMP transaction?  I was just
testing ACK with the transaction header the last couple of hours but did not
manage to get it to work - ACK is processed without having to issue COMMIT. 
In the following test, I subscribed to the topic &quot;keepalive&quot;, created a
transaction with id &quot;gwtx8&quot; and receive a message with payload &quot;I'm alive!&quot;. 

 SUBSCRIBE
destination:/topic/presence
ack:client-individual
id:alertgateway1
persistent:true
receipt:005

^@
RECEIPT
receipt-id:005

BEGIN
transaction:gwtx8

^@
MESSAGE
subscription:alertgateway1
destination:/topic/presence
message-id:T_alertgateway1@@session-sAtZSzKtm_X58pl46L0_uw@@3
receipt:003
persistent:true
content-length:19

I'm alive!

 ACK
subscription:alertgateway1
message-id:T_alertgateway1@@session-sAtZSzKtm_X58pl46L0_uw@@3
transaction:gwtx8
receipt:001

^@
RECEIPT
receipt-id:001
--&gt; ACK is processed without COMMIT
