Yes.

&gt;<i> RECEIPT

</I>&gt;<i> --&gt; ACK is processed without COMMIT
</I>

This RECEIPT does not mean the the broker acted on the ACK, only that it
has been received and added to all the other actions pending a COMMIT.
You can confirm that the number of unacknowledged messages in the queue
will not decrease until you issue a commit.
