You may want to try closing the connection with connection.close() (from 
a separate thread, due to 
<A HREF="http://rabbitmq.1065348.n5.nabble.com/Handling-Consumer-Cancel-Notifications-in-Java-Client-tc28688.html">http://rabbitmq.1065348.n5.nabble.com/Handling-Consumer-Cancel-Notifications-in-Java-Client-tc28688.html</A>)

Btw, it is not clear to me why you want to close the connection. The 
connection and channel are still alive and healthy; if you want to, say, 
create another queue &amp; consumer, that could be done on the existing 
connection/channel.
