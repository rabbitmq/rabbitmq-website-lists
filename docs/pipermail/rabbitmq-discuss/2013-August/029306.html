It's unavoidable. See below.

The node logs that it is in a minority. Then it shuts down rabbit. That
takes time. Now, we can quibble about *how much* time, but it will
always be a non-zero amount. And during that time the node will still 
happily accept connections and route messages. Plus of course minority 
detection isn't instantaneous either, i.e. there is a time window during 
which the node technically in a minority but hasn't detected that yet.

Matthias.
