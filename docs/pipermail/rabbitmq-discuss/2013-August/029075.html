<PRE>you are 100% right after a cerfull look consumers (which are on a
separated channels) were not blocked , the problem was the producers
which flow control blocks.
That said the results of blocked producers , I will execute the
rabbitmqctl report when the problem reproduces and share this.

Our current suspicion is that the consumers cannot write fast enough
to the graphite thus slowing down the producers until they get
blocked.

Thanks!
