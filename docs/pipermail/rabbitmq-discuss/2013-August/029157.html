Does this mean we need to block and/or use threads to receive messages?

Do you envisage making it work like boost::asio or have you seen
anything like that for AMQP?

Did you collaborate with anybody for the Debian package of the C client?

Has anybody discussed a package of the C++ client?


Just some background: I'm mentoring a student with Google Summer of
Code, he is making some changes to the reSIProcate project

reSIProcate is a strongly object-oriented C++ project, so to remain
consistent with the code style, using C++ would be nice.  Regular C
could be used too.  Some parts of the stack use asio, other parts use a
similar, single threaded async model.

What we have here is a SIP voice conferencing application:

  <A HREF="https://github.com/resiprocate/reConServer">https://github.com/resiprocate/reConServer</A>

The original version of the code just takes commands and prints
responses through stdin/stdout.  We would like to replace that with JSON
over RabbitMQ / AMQP

E.g.

- when a new caller dials in, a JSON message goes out on a topic

- the admin can send an instruction over a queue (e.g. move caller A
from room 1 to room 2)
