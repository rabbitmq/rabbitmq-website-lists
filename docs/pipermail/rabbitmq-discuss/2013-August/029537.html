<PRE>Hi Jon,

I'm not 100% familiar with Amazon's availability zones and how they work,
but... it sounds to me like they are in different locations and different
networks?  If so, clustering is probably not a good idea in this case.
 See: <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html</A>

I don't know if this is the cause for the issues you've seen, but it may be
the cause of issues in the future...  On the other hand, if I am wrong
about availabity zones, then you can safely disregard this message! ;-)

-Chris

&gt;<i> We've seen this happen twice now and each time it's been a pain to work
</I>&gt;<i> around (we ended up creating a whole new cluster each time). Here's the
</I>&gt;<i> scenario we have seen:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our setup:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Three RabbitMQ 3.1.5 nodes running on the Amazon Linux AMI. Each
</I>&gt;<i>    node is in a different availability zone in the US-EAST region on AWS.
</I>&gt;<i>    We'll call them nodes A, B, and C
</I>&gt;<i>    2. Each queue is using an HA policy
</I>&gt;<i>    3. All queues are durable
</I>&gt;<i>    4. We Basic.Publish with DeliveryMode=2
</I>&gt;<i>    5. All clients are initially connected to node A
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The scenario:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Node A is shutdown (the last time I did it via 'sudo
</I>&gt;<i>    /etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server stop
</I>&gt;<i>    2. All connected clients see the shutdown and successfully transition
</I>&gt;<i>    to using one of the other nodes. About half connect to node B and the other
</I>&gt;<i>    half connect to node C
</I>&gt;<i>    3. We notice that a few of the queues still show their &quot;node&quot; as being
</I>&gt;<i>    node A, even though it is not currently running.
</I>&gt;<i>    4. Node A is brought back online. The RabbitMQ management console
</I>&gt;<i>    (webapp) shows everything is fine on the homepage.
</I>&gt;<i>    5. When A comes back online, those queues that show A as their 'node'
</I>&gt;<i>    now show zero mirrors.
</I>&gt;<i>    6. I attempt to delete the queue via the management webapp. At that
</I>&gt;<i>    point all three nodes become 100% unresponsive. The management webapp fails
</I>&gt;<i>    to respond and all communication in our application stops. CPU fluctuates
</I>&gt;<i>    between 10-40% on but memory doesn't seem to be leaking. It's difficult to
</I>&gt;<i>    know what is happening because rabbitmqctl is also unresponsive. Attempts
</I>&gt;<i>    to gracefully stop the nodes all hang.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anybody have experience with this? What additional information should
</I>&gt;<i> I provide? It's causing a lot of stress and confuses the heck out of me.
</I>&gt;<i> Any guidance is much appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
