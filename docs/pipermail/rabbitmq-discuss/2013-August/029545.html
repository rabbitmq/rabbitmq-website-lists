Hi Jon,

Which HA policy are they using? (all/exactly/nodes)

What do you mean by &quot;their node&quot;? How did you determine this? What was
the output of &quot;rabbitmqctl cluster_status&quot; when A started up?

&gt;<i>  6. I attempt to delete the queue via the management webapp. At that

</I>
Do nodes still accept connections on port 5672?

&gt;<i> Does anybody have experience with this? What additional information

</I>
Are there any errors in the logfiles? The logfiles and sasl logs of all
3 brokers may help to determine the cause.

Please provide the output of &quot;rabbitmqctl report&quot; from just before the
brokers becomes unresponsive.

Can you reproduce the issue 100% reliably, and does this only happen on EC2?
