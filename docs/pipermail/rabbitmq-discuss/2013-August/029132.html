You have pause_minority mode enabled. From
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#automatic-handling:">http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#automatic-handling:</A>

</I>
So when you stop two nodes, the third determines itself to be in a 
minority, and pauses, becoming unresponsive.

If this behaviour is not what you want, then you don't want 
pause_minority mode.

Cheers, Simon
