<PRE>Hi,

Would anyone be able to give me some guidance on what I can expect from Rabbit regarding the rate of queue creation, and what I can do to increase it.

I have one Rabbit box with many virtual hosts, each host has a durable topic exchange.
The large majority of the time our system is creating approximately 5 queues per second with two bindings each across the whole rabbit box (I don't currently have figures for queue deletion) and each queue creation request averages about 350ms.
The queues are non-durable and make use of x-expires, x-message-ttl and auto-delete.

Recently I have started to get short lived spikes in queue creation up to approximately 20 queues per second across the whole rabbit box.
When this happens the queue creation request time can jump up to anywhere between 10000ms and 20000ms.
At the same time as this it appears as if the publishing request  to these exchanges also increases from about 40ms to about 5000ms.

I am currently using RabbitMQ 2.8.6 on Erlang R13B03 running on an Ubuntu server with 2Gb RAM

Thanks

Jim
