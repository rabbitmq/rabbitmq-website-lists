</I>You are right. I am maintaining a map of unconfirmed messages and removing
them in confirmation callback. Currently there is no checking or waiting at
all.

&gt;<i> Here's a test using MulticastMain (which ships with the Java client),

</I>1k is ok. I run these tests and got results similar to yours:

./runjava.sh com.rabbitmq.examples.MulticastMain -f persistent -c 1000 -q
512 -C 200000 -s 1024 -i 10
time: 10,041s, sent: 2647 msg/s, confirmed: 2547 msg/s, nacked: 0 msg/s,

I verified my implementation once again and there is one difference: I am
using flag mandatory. So I run the test with this flag:

./runjava.sh com.rabbitmq.examples.MulticastMain -f persistent mandatory -c
2000 -q 512 -C 200000 -s 1024 -i 10
time: 10,068s, sent: 212 msg/s, returned: 0 msg/s, confirmed: 83 msg/s,

time: 20,089s, sent: 96 msg/s, returned: 0 msg/s, confirmed: 91 msg/s,
nacked: 0 msg/s, received: 91 msg/s, min/avg/max latency:
8249958/10334398/13137973 microseconds

nacked: 0 msg/s, received: 86 msg/s, min/avg/max latency:
12775852/15313769/17857810 microseconds

./runjava.sh com.rabbitmq.examples.MulticastMain -f persistent mandatory -q
512 -C 200000 -s 1024 -i 10
time: 10,000s, sent: 6979 msg/s, returned: 0 msg/s, received: 6766 msg/s,
min/avg/max latency: 8588/347330/1112170 microseconds

min/avg/max latency: 159450/238629/369709 microseconds


It appears that the problem happens when I use both publisher confirms and
mandatory flag. Dropping mandatory flag solves it (I tested it and sending
is much faster in my application).
Still, I am surprised to see such drop in performance. What is the reason?
