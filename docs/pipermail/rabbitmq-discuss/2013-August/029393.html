<PRE>Hi Again ,

Thank you for your reply.

1) Sorry about not pasting code. But I realized that code is too long to
directly paste so I attached files then but looks like they are not
received so I am attaching again.

2) My exchange  as well as queue names are not really long. Neither my
routing key. For simplicity I just created exchange, queue and routing key
as string '1' , '2' like that so that later if required it's easy to
automate. For now I just run manually.

3) Regarding using faster client, I understand your point now and would
definitely give a try and see how it goes. I am thinking to give a try for
amqpc since it looks easy to give a try.

4) If you can quickly have a look at my current publisher/consumer and give
some higher level comments then it would help me to get direction.
In order to have easy start, I just adapted the examples of producer and
consumer given on pika site and I have not really brought in any major
changes since I wanted to get everything working and then slowly make
improvements if really required to this code.

Best Regards,
Priyanki.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so from this I interpreted as 297 bytes  non-payload + 100 bytes of

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this not normal ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd need to sit down and calculate how many bytes would a bare content

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * content header and body will vary depending on what you publish, what
</I>&gt;<i> values the properties have, etc
</I>&gt;<i>  * basic.ack is optional, that is, you can publish without acks (which
</I>&gt;<i> trades safety for improved throughput)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm slightly surprised that basic.publish frame is almost 90 bytes but it
</I>&gt;<i> may be the case if e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> exchange name is unusually long.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My publisher and consumer code looks like this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I assume it wasn't pasted by accident?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Regarding Interrupts and context switches point:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree and understand what you said about context switch but I wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to bring this up since I felt my CPU was spending lot of time in doing
</I>&gt;<i> context switches and that could be one of the reason that I don't get any
</I>&gt;<i> higher throughput even if I increase number of producer and receiver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How many cores (logical) does your CPU have? Do you only run a publisher
</I>&gt;<i> and RabbitMQ on this machine?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) Regarding changing to faster clients like Java or amqpc:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My current concern is not that I don't have sufficinet throughout, I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to understand given the fact later project need to use python
</I>&gt;<i> based client and not java based client, would like to understand how system
</I>&gt;<i> resources are used by rabbitmq.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seeing what kind of throughput you get with MulticastMain and/or amqpc
</I>&gt;<i> will show you
</I>&gt;<i> how fast your hardware, network and RabbitMQ node can go. This can prove
</I>&gt;<i> if you
</I>&gt;<i> are limited by your publisher's performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then you can profile your publisher to see what takes time. I wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting that you
</I>&gt;<i> should just use Java for your project, only to see if you can get a
</I>&gt;<i> noticeably better
</I>&gt;<i> throughput with a different client.
