The ack you get back from the broker in this situation just means that 
the broker has received the message and done whatever it's contractually 
required to do - if there is no queue then the defined behaviour is to 
drop the message, and the ack just tells you this has happened.

You might want to set the mandatory flag on publish. This will ensure 
that you get a basic.return back if the message is *not* routed to at 
least one queue.

See <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html</A> and
