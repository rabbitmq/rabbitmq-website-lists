<PRE>Priyanki Vashi:

&gt;<i> I have learnt from rabbitmq site that multiple flag in 'basic.ack' method, controls single message acknowledgement or multiple acknowledgement. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I could set 'multiple' to True in basic.ack method on consumer side but how to check that consumer is really acknowledging multiple messages and also where &amp; how to configure message count value? (I mean is it possible to have only one ack for a group of messages received by consumer instead of individual ack for every message)  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my wireshark traces, I see multiple is set to 'True' in 'basic.ack' method, which is sent from Consumer to Server but not sure weather it's really working or not  since it shows no difference in behavior in comparison to multiple to false. (I have tracked this as per delivery-tag value).
</I>
basic.ack with multiple = true will acknowledge all outstanding (unacknowledged) messages.
Acknowledged messages are removed from the queue.

Try adding a consumer and acknowledging, say, every 100th delivery with multiple = true.

If there is only one unacknowledged delivery, multiple = true is effectively the same as multiple = false.
