<PRE>Hi All,

I am looking for some clarification on the access control tags.

We are attempting to use a powershell script to add vhosts and users to our rabbitmq cluster. This is successful when the user is an administrator. As the password needs to be in many different configuration files for the automated deployment we would prefer not to use an administrator user. Is this possible? We have attempted with a user under the management tag to no avail.

Further detail:

We use vhosts to logically separate traffic which is for different customers. Each customers services are configured to use a different username which only has access to their vhost. The automated deployment of a new customer includes creation of the vhost and username. We are migrating customers to a newly created cluster of three nodes. Previous usage has been on a single windows rabbitmq box and vhosts created via the rabbitmqctl command line tool.

Cheers
