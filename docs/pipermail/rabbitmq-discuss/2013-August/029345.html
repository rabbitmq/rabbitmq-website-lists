<PRE>Hi ,

on_connection_open, is a callback method, which will be called when
connection is opened with rabbitmq. It opens channel inturn. So it's little
unlikely that it has 'None' value but I am not 100% sure.

Here is my code. Could you quickly have a look.
It's the same example from pika site for tornado consumer except that I
have tried to use connection parameters instead of URL.


from pika import adapters
import pika
import logging

LOG_FORMAT = ('%(levelname) -10s %(asctime)s %(name) -30s %(funcName) '
              '-35s %(lineno) -5d: %(message)s')
LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class ExampleConsumer(object):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;This is an example consumer that will handle unexpected interactions
    with RabbitMQ such as channel and connection closures.

    If RabbitMQ closes the connection, it will reopen it. You should
    look at the output, as there are limited reasons why the connection may
    be closed, which usually are tied to permission related issues or
    socket timeouts.

    If the channel is closed, it will indicate a problem with one of the
    commands that were issued and that should surface in the output as well.

    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    EXCHANGE = 'message'
    EXCHANGE_TYPE = 'topic'
    QUEUE = 'text'
    ROUTING_KEY = 'example.text'




    def __init__(self, host, port, username, password):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Setup the example publisher object, passing in the URL we will
use
        to connect to RabbitMQ.

        :param str amqp_url: The URL for connecting to RabbitMQ

        &quot;&quot;&quot;

        self._connection = None
        self._channel = None
        self._closing = False
        self._consumer_tag = None
        #self._url = amqp_url

        self.credentials = pika.PlainCredentials(username=username,
password=password)
        self.parameters = pika.ConnectionParameters(host=host, port=port,
credentials=self.credentials)



    def connect(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;This method connects to RabbitMQ, returning the connection
handle.
        When the connection is established, the on_connection_open method
        will be invoked by pika.

        :rtype: pika.SelectConnection

        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        #LOGGER.info('Connecting to %s', self._url)
        adapters.TornadoConnection(self.parameters,
on_open_callback=self.on_connection_open, stop_ioloop_on_close=False)
        #return
adapters.TornadoConnection(pika.URLParameters(self._url),self.on_connection_open)

    def close_connection(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;This method closes the connection to RabbitMQ.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        LOGGER.info('Closing connection')
        self._connection.close()

    def add_on_connection_close_callback(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;This method adds an on close callback that will be invoked by
pika
        when RabbitMQ closes the connection to the publisher unexpectedly.

        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        LOGGER.info('Adding connection close callback')
        self._connection.add_on_close_callback(self.on_connection_closed)

    def on_connection_closed(self, connection, reply_code, reply_text):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;This method is invoked by pika when the connection to RabbitMQ is
        closed unexpectedly. Since it is unexpected, we will reconnect to
        RabbitMQ if it disconnects.

        :param pika.connection.Connection connection: The closed connection
obj
        :param int reply_code: The server provided reply_code if given
        :param str reply_text: The server provided reply_text if given

        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        self._channel = None
        if self._closing:
            self._connection.ioloop.stop()
        else:
            LOGGER.warning('Connection closed, reopening in 5 seconds: (%s)
%s',
                           reply_code, reply_text)
            self._connection.add_timeout(5, self.reconnect)

    def on_connection_open(self, unused_connection):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;This method is called by pika once the connection to RabbitMQ has
        been established. It passes the handle to the connection object in
        case we need it, but in this case, we'll just mark it unused.

        :type unused_connection: pika.SelectConnection

        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        LOGGER.info('Connection opened')
        self.add_on_connection_close_callback()
        self.open_channel()

    def reconnect(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Will be invoked by the IOLoop timer if the connection is
        closed. See the on_connection_closed method.

        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        # This is the old connection IOLoop instance, stop its ioloop
        self._connection.ioloop.stop()

        if not self._closing:

            # Create a new connection
            self._connection = self.connect()

            # There is now a new connection, needs a new ioloop to run
            self._connection.ioloop.start()

    def add_on_channel_close_callback(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;This method tells pika to call the on_channel_closed method if
        RabbitMQ unexpectedly closes the channel.

        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        LOGGER.info('Adding channel close callback')
        self._channel.add_on_close_callback(self.on_channel_closed)

    def on_channel_closed(self, channel, reply_code, reply_text):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Invoked by pika when RabbitMQ unexpectedly closes the channel.
        Channels are usually closed if you attempt to do something that
        violates the protocol, such as re-declare an exchange or queue with
        different parameters. In this case, we'll close the connection
        to shutdown the object.

        :param pika.channel.Channel: The closed channel
        :param int reply_code: The numeric reason the channel was closed
        :param str reply_text: The text reason the channel was closed

        LOGGER.warning('Channel %i was closed: (%s) %s',
                       channel, reply_code, reply_text)
        self._connection.close()

    def on_channel_open(self, channel):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;This method is invoked by pika when the channel has been opened.
        The channel object is passed in so we can make use of it.

        Since the channel is now open, we'll declare the exchange to use.

        :param pika.channel.Channel channel: The channel object

    def setup_exchange(self, exchange_name):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Setup the exchange on RabbitMQ by invoking the Exchange.Declare
RPC
        command. When it is complete, the on_exchange_declareok method will
        be invoked by pika.

    def on_queue_declareok(self, method_frame):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Method invoked by pika when the Queue.Declare RPC call made in
        setup_queue has completed. In this method we will bind the queue
        and exchange together with the routing key by issuing the Queue.Bind
        RPC command. When this command is complete, the on_bindok method
will
        be invoked by pika.

        :param pika.frame.Method method_frame: The Queue.DeclareOk frame

    def add_on_cancel_callback(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Add a callback that will be invoked if RabbitMQ cancels the
consumer
        for some reason. If RabbitMQ does cancel the consumer,

        channel is passed for your convenience. The basic_deliver object
that
        is passed in carries the exchange, routing key, delivery tag and
        a redelivered flag for the message. The properties passed in is an

        &quot;&quot;&quot;This method is invoked by pika when RabbitMQ acknowledges the
        cancellation of a consumer. At this point we will close the channel.
        This will invoke the on_channel_closed method once the channel has
been
        closed, which will in-turn close the connection.

        which returns the consumer tag that is used to uniquely identify the
        consumer with RabbitMQ. We keep the value to use it when we want to
        cancel consuming. The on_message method is passed in as a callback
pika
