<PRE>This is my setup:

I have an exchange named &quot;live&quot; with a queue named &quot;livequeue&quot; bound to it 
by routing key &quot;msg&quot;, and another exchange named &quot;deferred&quot; with a queue 
named &quot;deferredqueue&quot; bound to it, also with routing key &quot;msg&quot;.
&quot;livequeue&quot; has set the exchange &quot;deferred&quot; as dead-letter exchange and 
&quot;msg&quot; as dead-letter routing key, and &quot;deferredqueue&quot; has set a message TTL 
of 5 minutes, &quot;live&quot; as dead-letter exchange and &quot;msg&quot; as dead-letter 
routing key.
Messages are initially published to exchange &quot;live&quot; with routing key &quot;msg&quot; 
by a publisher, so they end up in queue &quot;livequeue&quot;. Consumers will read 
from &quot;livequeue&quot; and either process and ack the message, or if they can't 
process it right away, reject it with requeue set to false. On rejection, 
the message will move to &quot;deferredqueue&quot; through the dead-letter exchange 
of &quot;livequeue&quot;.
Everything works as expected up to this point. However, when the message 
TTL of &quot;deferredqueue&quot; is up, I expected the message to reappear again in 
&quot;livequeue&quot; via the dead-letter exchange of &quot;deferredqueue&quot;, but the 
message is dropped instead.
If, however, I ack the message in &quot;livequeue&quot; and publish it to 
&quot;deferredqueue&quot; using basic_publish, instead of rejecting it, the message *
does* reappear in &quot;livequeue&quot;  after the TTL is over, as expected.

So my question is, is this the normal (intended) behavior, or am I doing 
something wrong? If this is the normal behavior, is there a way to change 
it by some exchange/queue/message property, so it will work as I initially 
planned?
This is *not* a request to change anything in RabbitMQ or AMQP, I just want 
to know how to handle this kind of thing properly.
