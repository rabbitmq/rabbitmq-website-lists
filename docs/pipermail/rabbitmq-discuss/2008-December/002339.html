</I>
Sorry it was still unclear; I rewrote the email twice before hitting  
the send button. :)

Your last sentence quoted above gets it exactly. Each publisher will  
set the sequence number to 0 so that the republisher/sequencer service  
can add the global number stamp to it. I guess the publishers could  
also set it to nil; the initial value is irrelevant since the  
Sequencer will overwrite it.

The use case is to stamp a global order on all messages through the  
broker for the purposes of replay, debugging and async logging. I  
realize that during normal operation the services will be publishing  
messages in an arbitrary order; it doesn't matter to me. I need to  
recreate that arbitrary order *exactly* for a replay.

Think of the sequencer as the software equivalent of a hardware bus  
clock. Alternately, think of the sequencer as the equivalent of adding  
an identity column to a database table (this column contains a  
monotonically increasing integer assigned by the server).

&gt;<i> BTW I don't whether the delivery tag that is sent in the header of the
</I>&gt;<i> message to the consumer is of any use to you for sequencing.
</I>
I don't plan to use the delivery tag at all. When I republish, I need  
to pass through the routing key from the original message's header.

&gt;&gt;<i> I've read some notes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about future releases of rabbitmq allowing for &quot;internal&quot; clients  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> run inside the rabbitmq memory space. I think this is an ideal use of

</I>&gt;<i> The Erlang AMQP library can run transparently in the address space of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The types of things that this is useful for is processing messages in
</I>&gt;<i> a custom fashion without a network hop and you can stick to the AMQP
</I>&gt;<i> model rather than having to write something that is Rabbit specific.
</I>&gt;<i> This also takes advantage of the fact that Erlang processes are
</I>&gt;<i> isolated from each other and so it is ok to run &quot;foreign code&quot; in the
</I>&gt;<i> same memory space as the broker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I don't know if this solves your problem, because as I stated
</I>&gt;<i> above, I didn't really understand it.
</I>
I think this does solve the issue. I don't know Erlang yet so I'll  
probably keep the Sequencer as an external Java client for the short- 
term, but it's nice to know I can get a performance win with a rewrite  
in Erlang. Avoiding the TCP overhead, even if it is short circuited on  
a localhost, is a good thing.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Is there a way to make this more dynamic so I do not have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> declare all the exchanges up-front in this sequencer code? Ideally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this service could detect that new exchanges were declared by other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> services and automatically subscribe to them to do the sequence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stamping and routing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if the terminology is right here, because you generally
</I>&gt;<i> don't subscribe to an exchange, rather to a queue.
</I>
You are right. I was confusing the terminology. Let me try again.

As other services declare exchanges and publish to them, I would like  
my Sequencer to dynamically detect the existence of a new Exchange so  
it can create a queue, bind the new queue to the Exchange and receive  
messages from it for processing and republishing.
