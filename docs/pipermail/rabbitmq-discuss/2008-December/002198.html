True. Threads only present parallelism to the programmer in a easy to
understand fashion.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see what you mean. Also, when we tested the OpenAMQ C client we discovered

</I>
Yes, Pieter doesn't think the channels are good idea and hence the
OpenAMQ client limits the amount of channels within a connection to
one. In order to get parallelism you need to start a separate AMQP/TCP
connection.

Personally I think this approach has its merits, because I don't think
there is any real proven benefit of re-inventing flow control, but I
may be wrong.

As to whether they will be removed, I can't say anything about the
actual spec. There is a low volume dev list at amqp.org, maybe you can
ask your question there.

HTH,

Ben
