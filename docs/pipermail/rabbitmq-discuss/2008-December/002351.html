I took a look but my lack of knowledge regarding Erlang made the code  
look like line noise. :)

&gt;<i> You still have the problem of how to maintain the global counter

</I>
I don't understand this issue. Do you say this because the deliver/5  
function may be called from many Erlang threads thereby requiring the  
counter to be protected by a mutex? I thought Erlang serialized all  
accesses via messaging to &quot;mailboxes&quot; so these kinds of race  
conditions did not exist.

What is the problem with doing (the Erlang equivalent of):
global_counter++;

I am only concerned about the replay order.

&gt;<i> If your application could tolerate some perceived re-ordering, but

</I>
This sounds reasonable.

But let me make sure I am understanding you clearly. You are saying  
that it is possible for messages to be stamped in a different order  
than they were received by the Exchange. Is that the case? Or are you  
saying they may be delivered to queues in a different order than they  
were received by the Exchange?

Off-list I received a message from Alexis who highlighted this issue.  
Apparently the 0-8 AMQP spec does not address any ordering constraints  
except in the case of Queues, so the server has the option of  
reordering messages internally while processing. I don't think this  
really bothers me all that much.

&gt;<i> Having said that, you might find using plain jane timestamps easier,
</I>&gt;<i> if you can relax this true global ordering constraint a bit.
</I>
Why is a timestamp better? Is it because it pushes the access to a  
&quot;global counter&quot; (in this case the system clock) outside of Erlang?  
Your answer to the earlier ordering questions will likely answer this  
one too.

I am not opposed to using a timestamp. I thought it would be *simpler*  
(and faster) to use an integer.
