<PRE>I've got a client retrieving messages quite happily as an Excel add in. I've attached event handlers to the CallBackException event handlers on both the IModel and IConnection objects, but I'm seeing uncaught exceptions in the rabbit client dll e.g.

A first chance exception of type 'RabbitMQ.Client.Exceptions.AlreadyClosedException' occurred in RabbitMQ.Client.dll

Obviously I'd like to catch these exceptions and take recovery action, but they're not being passed to me, I'm simply seeing them reported in the debugger. How can I trap these conditions and take recovery action?
