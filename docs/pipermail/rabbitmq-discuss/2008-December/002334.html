Sure, but if I was really worried about latency, I don't know if would
go down the embedded route.

Maybe you could look at an application that does not constantly stress
the middleware - hence having something light weight would not cost
much when it's not doing anything and hence been *greener*. Having
said this, I think this may be a question of how long is a piece of
string -  for example, you could also compare bang for for energy buck
by running virtualized machines.

This is getting a bit more rabbitty (maybe this question should
migrate to the rabbit discussion list? I've cross-posted just in
case).

In the Rabbit client library there is a utility called MulticastMain,
which, if you run it the --help flag, will tell you about all of the
configuration options you have to test latency and throughput from a
client perspective.

HTH,

Ben
