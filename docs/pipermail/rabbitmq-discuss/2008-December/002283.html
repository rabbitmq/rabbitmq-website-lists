I'm not sure it's the same thing. What I'm seeing is the expected exceptions being thrown when, for example, the network connection is lost. The problem is, I can't see how I can easily catch these exceptions and react to them, for example, if the network connection is lost I'd like to be able tear down the model and connection, and then attempt to reconnect. Currently I can't see how I can catch these events. Maybe I'm missing something.

In our internal middle tier system, when the connection is lost the middle tier itself takes care of remaking the connection, as network faults can be transient this is what you want. At the same time, the client is called back to indicate that the connection has been lost, and is called back when the connection is remade.

AFAICT there aren't any hooks on the IConnection or IModel to enable the client process to handle these sort of exceptions. If I add a handler with

              conn.CallbackException += new RabbitMQ.Client.Events.CallbackExceptionEventHandler(conn_CallbackException);
   or
                model.CallbackException += new RabbitMQ.Client.Events.CallbackExceptionEventHandler(model_CallbackException);

they don't get called when these sort of errors occur.
