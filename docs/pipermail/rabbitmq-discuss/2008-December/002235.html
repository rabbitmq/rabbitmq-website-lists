<PRE>Hi Alexis,

A bit late but I think this very good news. Now let's hope all  
implementers will implement 0.9.1 :-)

Enjoy,

Michael

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The RabbitMQ team is very pleased to announce that the AMQP 0-9-1
</I>&gt;<i> specification was approved by the AMQP Working Group in a vote
</I>&gt;<i> yesterday.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The need for AMQP 0-9-1 arose from the AMQP community and AMQP
</I>&gt;<i> customers.  The community wants interoperability - indeed this is a
</I>&gt;<i> major goal of AMQP.  People frequently try to download a broker from
</I>&gt;<i> one implementor, and use it with a client from another implementor.
</I>&gt;<i> Even when both sets of code implement the same specification, this has
</I>&gt;<i> not always worked 'out of the box'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Frequently asked questions have included &quot;how to I do I ..&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * get OpenAMQ's C client working with RabbitMQ,
</I>&gt;<i> * or get RabbitMQ's Java client to work with OpenAMQ
</I>&gt;<i> * use QPid's M2.1 JMS-style Java client with RabbitMQ
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This has all been possible and people have done it, but in each case
</I>&gt;<i> it has been a few hours of coding to get it working, without the
</I>&gt;<i> assurance you want from a fully QAd or regression-tested and certified
</I>&gt;<i> package.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I think we all want interop to work out of the box and many people
</I>&gt;<i> have said they expect this too.  Interop would also remove cost from
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;business to business&quot; integration projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AMQP 0-9-1 was created to meet that need.  It is a simplified 'interop
</I>&gt;<i> release' that starts from the 0-9 specification and then fixes interop
</I>&gt;<i> bugs and removes a lot of unused material.  For reasons of backwards
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility with certain existing deployments, the 0-9-1 spec will
</I>&gt;<i> work with 0-9 wire frames.  This means that the community can expect
</I>&gt;<i> to get what it demands: a set of brokers and clients that work
</I>&gt;<i> together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The work to achieve this clean up was a collective effort and
</I>&gt;<i> represents 18 months of 'lessons learnt in production' by all the
</I>&gt;<i> major AMQP implementations in the 0-8/0-9 family.  Documents should
</I>&gt;<i> appear on <A HREF="http://www.amqp.org">http://www.amqp.org</A> imminently.  Thank-you to all those
</I>&gt;<i> involved on behalf of the RabbitMQ team.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I should also explain what AMQP 0-9-1 is *not*.  It does not
</I>&gt;<i> interoperate with AMQP 0-10.  AMQP 0-10 introduces technology for
</I>&gt;<i> transactional 'once and only once' delivery within the protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> Similar features are planned for AMQP 1.0 which is currently under
</I>&gt;<i> development by the Working Group.  So please see 0-9-1 as a
</I>&gt;<i> stabilisation of earlier spec work, based on hard experience in
</I>&gt;<i> production with the 0-8 and 0-9 protocols.  Current and future
</I>&gt;<i> protocol work concerns the step up to the 1.0 business requirements as
</I>&gt;<i> published on <A HREF="http://www.amqp.org.">http://www.amqp.org.</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does this mean for RabbitMQ users?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interop is good news for RabbitMQ because we think messaging should
</I>&gt;<i> 'just work'.  RabbitMQ will implement AMQP 0-9-1 on the 1.x tree.
</I>&gt;<i> AMQP 0-9-1 is absurdly similar to 0-8 and 0-9, which is one reason we
</I>&gt;<i> found the 'interop delta' so frustrating.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For RabbitMQ users this means a migration path not much more complex
</I>&gt;<i> than (say) moving from RabbitMQ 1.3 to 1.4.  Existing deployments will
</I>&gt;<i> continue to work but some methods - eg. access tickets - are now
</I>&gt;<i> formally deprecated.  For implementors of clients, the cost of
</I>&gt;<i> upgrading to 0-9-1 should not be more than a day's coding in most
</I>&gt;<i> cases.  RabbitMQ will provide updated client codegen tools when an
</I>&gt;<i> 0-9-1 broker is released.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In terms of timing and details of the RabbitMQ 1.x broker roadmap, I
</I>&gt;<i> refer you to the development team.  For discussions on this as well as
</I>&gt;<i> packaging dependencies, and client release plans, we strongly urge the
</I>&gt;<i> community to come forward with comments, questions and offers of
</I>&gt;<i> assistance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We hope the RabbitMQ community places a high value on 0-9-1 interop -
</I>&gt;<i> as high as we do as providers of the product.  I cannot speak here for
</I>&gt;<i> the other implementations but we have good reason to believe that
</I>&gt;<i> their respective communities will value 0-9-1 interop equally highly.
</I>&gt;<i> But if you see gaps - please jump in and help with some code or
</I>&gt;<i> requirements.  Or - even better - provide some test harnesses.  And if
</I>&gt;<i> you see any errata then you can also list them here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about 2009?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With interest growing in AMQP around the community, and the Working
</I>&gt;<i> Group being joined by Microsoft, we think AMQP is in good shape for
</I>&gt;<i> the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Members of the RabbitMQ community who wish to contribute to the
</I>&gt;<i> development of the protocol as we move towards 1.0, should not be shy
</I>&gt;<i> of speaking up on this list.  We aim to track this spec and invite
</I>&gt;<i> implementation ideas for RabbitMQ 2.0.  We don't want to rush things -
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ's existing implementations set a high bar.  Stability at
</I>&gt;<i> scale, and ease of use, are of the utmost importance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So - finally - I think this is a very good time to say a big thank-you
</I>&gt;<i> to everyone who has made RabbitMQ successful so far.   Thank-you!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes,
</I>&gt;<i>
