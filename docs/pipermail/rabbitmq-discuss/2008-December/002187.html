<PRE>Hi Barry,

This is interesting work. We are currently using the Qpid M1 python  
client and aren't entirely satisfied, especially with error handling.  
As we're about to decide on a new client library py-amqplib has been  
considered. Until now it hasn't really been an option due to the lack  
of support for timeout, basic.reject etc. However with this latest  
message I want to consider it again.

The other candidate we have considered is naturally the Qpid M2.1 or  
M3 pythin lib. Do you have any idea about the difference? If not then  
maybe you can tell me what let you to write py-amqplib instead of  
using the Qpid client? I remember in the beginning something about  
specifically going for a unthreaded library, but it seems you have  
given that up (which incidentally makes very much sense in my book  
considering the AMQP protocol).

Regards,

Michael Arnoldus
