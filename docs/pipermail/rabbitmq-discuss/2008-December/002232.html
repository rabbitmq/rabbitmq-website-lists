the is no automatic way in current PHP implementation.

I guess it is not a problem since PHP world is single-threaded.

Thanks! These links are quite interesting. I must make it clear that  
developing PHP AMQP library is not in my long term plans. I just  
needed to send some messages to RabbitMQ from PHP code and I ported  
this code. In general I am trying to avoid PHP. I would rather spend  
my time working on improving the Python library.

I hope some people will find my PHP code useful and take over from me  
and turn it into good PHP library, perhaps packaged as PEAR module. I  
will be glad to grant SVN access rights to anybody interested.  
Eventually I will be glad to cease project admin rights, once the  
right person emerges. Maybe it is a good idea to maintain it in sync  
with the Python library (as Barry mentions in the previous message),  
so some coordination may be required.

Sincerely,
Vadim
