Let me provide more reasoning for why I would like to do this  
dynamically.

PublisherA may create a durable topic Exchange called out.topic1.  
PublisherB may create a non-durable Exchange called out.topic2.

The Sequencer has to republish all messages from both Exchanges to two  
new Exchanges that share the same semantics (durable vs non-durable,  
immediate, mandatory, etc). The Sequencer would need to declare a new  
durable Exchange called in.topic1 for republishing those messages.  
Likewise, it would declare a non-durable Exchange for publishing to  
in.topic2. (I hope I am not mixing up my durable/immediate/mandatory  
terminology with Exchanges when they apply to Queues or something.)

A naive way of creating the Sequencer would be to hardcode all of  
these things but that could rapidly become a maintenance nightmare as  
the distributed application grows.
