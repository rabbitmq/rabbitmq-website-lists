Qpid broker c++ already has this if you want to copy the way we do it. 
If you do
I can point you to the information.

</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each service connecting to the broker will publish to a topic  
</I>&gt;<i> exchange. One to N other services may subscribe to the published data.  
</I>&gt;<i> I foresee a topic hierarchy like so:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> out.topic1 (passive, durable)
</I>&gt;<i> out.topic2 (passive, non-durable)
</I>&gt;<i> out.topic3.subtopic1 (passive, non-durable)
</I>&gt;<i> out.topic3.subtopic2 (passive, durable)
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These exchanges are named with dot notation for simplicity of parsing  
</I>&gt;<i> for regular expressions. I realize the exchange name doesn't need the  
</I>&gt;<i> dot notation whereas that is a requirement for routing keys.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of my data is serialized as a JSON object prior to publishing. The  
</I>&gt;<i> object (hash) contains a key called :sequence which is set to 0 by the  
</I>&gt;<i> publisher. The sequencer service will subscribe to all out.# topics  
</I>&gt;<i> (with '#' as the routing key so it gets everything), read the content  
</I>&gt;<i> body as a Map, and set the map :sequence value to i++ where 'i' is a  
</I>&gt;<i> 32-bit (or 64-bit) integer. It will then republish the JSON object to  
</I>&gt;<i> a new topic of the form &quot;in.topicX&quot; and pass through the original  
</I>&gt;<i> routing key. It's routing between, for example, out.topic1 and  
</I>&gt;<i> in.topic1 and adding a sequence number as a side effect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I played around with the examples SimpleTopicPublisher and  
</I>&gt;<i> SimpleTopicConsumer as a basis for a new class. I was able to add a  
</I>&gt;<i> JSONReader and JSONWriter to the new java class I call Sequencer. It  
</I>&gt;<i> successfully performs the work as described in the prior paragraph.  
</I>&gt;<i> RIght now I statically declare the in &amp; out exchanges, but I see how I  
</I>&gt;<i> could declare the &quot;in&quot; exchange based on the contents of the &quot;out&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> exchange name received in the envelope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a few outstanding questions that I'm hoping some more  
</I>&gt;<i> experienced folks can help answer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. This code will likely start before other services, so it will  
</I>&gt;<i> declare the exchanges and block on them while waiting for traffic. The  
</I>&gt;<i> topic Consumer/Producer examples all illustrate how to do this with a  
</I>&gt;<i> single exchange. How do I accomplish this task with multiple  
</I>&gt;<i> exchanges? Do I need a separate thread and channel for each exchange?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Is there a better way to accomplish this task? I've read some notes  
</I>&gt;<i> about future releases of rabbitmq allowing for &quot;internal&quot; clients that  
</I>&gt;<i> run inside the rabbitmq memory space. I think this is an ideal use of  
</I>&gt;<i> that capability. Am I right or barking up the wrong tree? And does  
</I>&gt;<i> that internal client need to be written in erlang or can it be java/c/ 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Is there a way to make this more dynamic so I do not have to  
</I>&gt;<i> declare all the exchanges up-front in this sequencer code? Ideally  
</I>&gt;<i> this service could detect that new exchanges were declared by other  
</I>&gt;<i> services and automatically subscribe to them to do the sequence  
</I>&gt;<i> stamping and routing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any feedback.
