In the past we've spoken to the guys at Canonical to discuss this.
Basically our strategy is to get into Debian and hence get into Ubuntu
via the back door (or is that a front door?). Hubert tells me that
we're pretty close to this, but if you need to know more, I'm sure he
can give more information.

&gt;<i> Going through the checklist for a new Ubuntu package here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/CodeReviews#NewPackage">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/CodeReviews#NewPackage</A>

</I>&gt;<i> one of the requirements is &quot;Upstream should be responsive, and maintain
</I>&gt;<i> a bug tracker&quot;. I've been on this list for a while, and you are
</I>&gt;<i> certainly responsive! This is a very healthy community. However, I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't been able to find a public bug tracker. Is there one?
</I>
We use bugzilla internally but do not expose it externally.
Essentially the mailing list is our public bug database. There have
been some discussion threads about this on the list recently.

&gt;<i> You would be welcome to use launchpad.net for your bug tracker, if you
</I>&gt;<i> need one - it looks like someone already &quot;reserved&quot; the rabbitmq project

Cool, thanks for the heads up :-)

&gt;<i> I've enjoyed reading through the FAQ you started here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lettuce.squarespace.com/">http://lettuce.squarespace.com/</A> . Just so you are aware of it,
</I>&gt;<i> launchpad.net has an &quot;Answers&quot; feature that allows people in a community
</I>&gt;<i> to ask questions (in a variety of languages), and then awards karma to
</I>&gt;<i> people for answering the questions. You can also turn questions into
</I>&gt;<i> FAQs, and there is a workflow for converting a question into a bug
</I>&gt;<i> report. <A HREF="https://help.launchpad.net/Answers">https://help.launchpad.net/Answers</A>

Good to know, I'll check it out.

Ben
