Well apart from breaking the golden rule of &quot;share nothing&quot; in a
cluster, doing this should be straight forward.

What I mean to say is that stamping each message with a header
property is a pretty trivial extension in terms of the lines of code
you'd have to write to set the header.

And you could use mnesia to maintain a globally unique ordering key
and not have to worry about the coherency of this key.

So all in all, this is all quite doable.

The downside to synchronizing of a single piece of global state (which
is what strict global ordering implies) is that you introduce a not
insignificant bottleneck into the system.

So unless you come up with some funky way to maintain a coherent
global counter, your application will not scale.

Having said that, if scalability/throughput/latency are not issues for
you, then I would cut to the chase and go for the custom exchange I
described earlier.

&gt;<i> This is the best suggestion yet. I'll start with a Java client and as

</I>&gt;<i> that it makes more sense to farm this kind of activity out to the real
</I>&gt;<i> experts.
</I>
As indicated above, setting this for each message would not be too
difficult to do. Given a mechanism to maintain a global counter, it
would be less effort to do the custom exchange that any external relay
mechanism.

HTH,

Ben
