Good question, I don't think that it's very expressive without using
some kind of thread model - although obviously from a kernel
perspective, everything is just a state machine :-)

Having said that, I think you *may* have taken what I said out of
perspective - just because you get rid of channels does not mean that
that you have to get rid of client side threads. The main motivation
behind command multiplexing within a single TCP connection *seems* to
be to allow multiple clients threads to use a single connection.
However, it is conceivable that each client side thread could have
it's own transport layer connection (or not-connection in the case of
UDP). So a client could thread as much as it likes, and the server
could remain oblivious of this.

The reason why command multiplexing has been questioned is because it
*apparently* re-invents flow control mechanisms that are already
available in TCP and SCTP.

I think that the question about threading is more of a client design
issue than a general protocol discussion.

HTH,

Ben
