<PRE>So this certainly sounds like it *should* work. At the very least, part 
of our test suite asserts that e2e bindings get routed upstream just 
like queue bindings :-)

I think one way to simplify what you're doing would be for the staging 
broker to just contain a federated &quot;ingestion&quot; exchange, with an 
upstream of the production server's &quot;ingestion&quot; exchange, with no extra 
intermediate exchanges. (The upstream exchange does not need to be 
federated, unless it in turn has upstreams.) That sounds like a simpler 
way to get what you want, but what you are trying *should* work.

One possibility is that you haven't set up some of the intermediate 
bindings correctly? If you want to proceed with your current setup you 
could try binding queues to each exchange in the chain and seeing how 
far messages are getting.

Cheers, Simon
