That port (44154) is the port used for Erlang distribution, not for 
AMQP. We could probably make this clearer.

But that text is part of an error message that gets displayed when you 
attempt to start two RabbitMQ servers with the same node name. Is that 
what you are doing?

&gt;<i> =INFO REPORT==== 25-Sep-2012::12:23:43 ===

</I>
The log shows port 5672 being opened as we would expect. So what actual 
error are you seeing when clients try to connect?

Cheers, Simon
