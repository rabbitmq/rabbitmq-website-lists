The topic exchange doesn't have that logic. But you can fake it with the 
alternate exchange feature, at the cost of a few more exchanges.

Declare a fanout exchange you'll publish to (let's call it 
&quot;my-exchange&quot;). Declare a fanout exchange called &quot;junk&quot;.

The when each consumer declares a queue, it also declares a topic 
exchange and a fanout exchange. The alternate-exchange for the topic 
exchange should be set to the fanout exchange. It then binds the topic 
exchange to &quot;my-exchange&quot;, and &quot;junk&quot; to the topic exchange, with a 
routing key equal to the topics it doesn't want.

Thus messages with the &quot;bad&quot; routing key go:

   [my-exchange] -&gt; [per-consumer-topic] -&gt; [junk]

and the rest go:

   [my-exchange] -&gt; [per-consumer-topic] -&gt; [per-consumer-fanout] -&gt; 
[per-consumer-queue]

I think that's the simplest you can make it. But exchanges are cheap in 
general, it's just routing logic.

But I wonder whether some sort of more explicit negation feature would 
be feasible / useful. Hmm.

Cheers, Simon
