<PRE>Hi Simon,
 
 
when ever to try to run the consumer process getting the error.
 
Logging in: connection closed unexpectedly
 
also please help us in setting the port details for the rabbitmq server and 
where I can find rabbitmq.config file in the ubuntu machine? 
so that, we can use that port to login as a consumer process.
 
Thanks
Shankaralingegowda
