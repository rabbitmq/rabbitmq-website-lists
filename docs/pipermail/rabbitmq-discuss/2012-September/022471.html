<PRE>Interesting! It's more of a &quot;nice-to-have&quot; option for me, much less
important than good performance, reliable federation, etc.

Multiple bindings and sender-selected distribution add richness as well
that mitigate the need.

And we have a scheme for distilling complex combinations of subscriber
roles and topic interests into multiple pairs of symmetric 128 character
strings which, with separating periods, create 255 char keys that are used
for binding 'sieves' and publishing 'patterns' respectively in topic
exchanges.

Seems quite fast. Actually my developers are still scratching their heads
and not actually using it yet - but it's good to get out in front of them
sometimes :)

Plus there's a lot of headroom left in the scheme if we fully exploit the
depth of each character position, so we should be able to stay out front
for awhile&#352;
