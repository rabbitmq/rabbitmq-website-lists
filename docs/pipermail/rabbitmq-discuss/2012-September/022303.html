</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We've upgraded Rabbit to 2.8.6.  Erlang has not yet been upgraded, but will be in our next release cycle.  R12B-5.8 was the newest official build we could find that worked with Fedora 11; I've since been able to hand-build the latest Erlang release, but it's still working its way through our testing department.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> R12 is really old and the general performance if the emulator has improved hugely since.
</I>
Understood.  Is it plausible that the Erlang version could explain the
sort of intermittent long delays we're seeing?  The upgrade is in the
works, but as we're dealing with a fielded robotic system, there's quite
a bit of testing necessary before an underpinning change like that is
released.

&gt;&gt;<i> With #1, we're seeing the following librabbitmq-c functions occasionally take up to 7.28 seconds to return (3-4 seconds is much more common):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - amqp_queue_declare
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - amqp_queue_bind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - amqp_basic_consume
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can you ascertain how much of that time is spent is system calls waiting for the network?
</I>
Not at present: I haven't instrumented librabbitmq-c as yet.  However,
Rabbit and the client are running on the same machine, connecting over
the loopback (127.0.0.1) interface.  I would expect network delays to be
minimal, though I haven't proven that yet.

&gt;&gt;<i> We've primarily observed this happening just after launching a new thread, which establishes a fresh connection to Rabbit successfully and quickly, but has issues when establishing its first subscription.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You do know that librabbitmq-c is *not* thread safe, at least iirc!?
</I>
Yep.  Each thread opens its own TCP connection to Rabbit, and maintains
its own state.

&gt;&gt;<i> My suspicion is that Rabbit is hitting disk for some reason; we've seen I/O-related delays with other processes (e.g. sqlite) with configuration #1 that we don't see with #2.  The SSD may be enough faster that we don't notice the issue on configuration #2.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> According to top output (below) that's not happening an rabbit will not page to disk without hitting the high memory watermark if your messages are non persistent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I don't see any reason that Rabbit would be hitting the disk.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly.
</I>
Okay, thanks.  I wasn't sure if there were any other triggers that would
cause Rabbit to touch the disk, such as the creation of a queue.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if this delay is happening in the client rather than the server. Does a standalone sample client with no threading take so lob to perform the basic operations?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I haven't been able to reproduce this in a standalone example yet, but I
also haven't made the attempt on the same hardware that we're seeing the
problem on.  Doing so is next on my list.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You might also be hitting flow control, but that is related to running out of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> RAM.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Um, isn't flow control actually about applying back pressure to producers when the system is overloaded? That sounds feasible and isn't afaict just about hitting ram limits.
</I>
How does Rabbit define 'overloaded'?  It's a dual-core system; one core
is pretty much pegged by one of our processes, but the other is under
only light load.  I've never seen Rabbit consume more than ~10% of it.

Thanks,

-Brennan
