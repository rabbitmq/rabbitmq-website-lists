If you make the names cryptographically strong names then nobody can 
guess them.

Firstly, the semantics of multiple bindings with the same destination is 
that of disjunction - the message is routed to the destination if it 
matches one or more of the bindings. By contrast, what you seem to want 
is a conjunction of negations. Or, equivalently, a negated disjunction. 
I suppose the later could be expressed as a single binding, using 
binding parameters to hold all the constituent parts, but it would be 
far from natural.

Secondly, we don't store bindings in a list. There is a fairly 
sophisticated data structure and algorithm underpinning the topic 
matching. See

<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2010/09/14/very-fast-and-scalable-topic-routing-part-1/">http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2010/09/14/very-fast-and-scalable-topic-routing-part-1/</A>

and

I am pretty sure negation doesn't fit in there and indeed I wouldn't be 
surprised to discover that introducing negation results in a theoretical 
matching complexity of O(binding_count).

Matthias.
