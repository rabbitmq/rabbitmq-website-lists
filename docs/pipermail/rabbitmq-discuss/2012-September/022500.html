No notification is sent to the publisher in that case. A basic.return is 
only sent if *no* queues were able to send the message to a consumer 
immediately.

Here are a few more warts about 'immediate':

- while a message might get sent out to a consumer straight away, there 
is of course no guarantee that such a message will reach the consumer, 
get processed and ack'ed. If any of these steps go wrong the message 
will end up in the queue (unless the consuming happened with no-ack, in 
which case it is simply lost), even though supposedly it was delivered 
immediately.

- a queue can have a consumer and yet 'immediate' delivery may fail (and 
a basic.return issued) because:
a) the consumer isn't quick enough and a backlog of messages has built up,
b) the consumer has configured a 'basic.qos' prefetch count and that the 
limit has been reached

- the interaction with transactions is not at all obvious. This does 
apply to 'mandatory' too though. See
