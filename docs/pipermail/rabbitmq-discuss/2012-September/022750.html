Could you post a link to the sample code, please, so that Michael can 
remove the use of 'immediate' from it?

&gt;<i> So I should yank immediate?
</I>
Yes, but that has nothing to do with the problem you were seeing.

</I>
'broken' might be a bit harsh, 'surprising' perhaps ;) Anyway, this is 
one for Michael.

Regards,

Matthias.
