Yeah I tripped on that too. That was when I removed it and installed the 
one from the official repository as detailed in 
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html</A>

That one then had better logging and told me &quot;unable to resolve 
hostname&quot; which brought me to the solution. Since the problem seems to 
exist in both versions and I found some forums/messages about &quot;not 
resolving&quot; at startup and how to fix it (via NODENAME entry) and came to 
the findings I am detailing here I thought I need to let you know.

Currently my workaround is simply to force a pre-existing configuration 
file down to the host in question with NODENAME set so the installation 
of the package does not trigger errors and consequently alerts. We're a 
service provider with thousands of managed services and hosts and we 
don't install programs by hand but via management software (in this 
case: puppet) so throwing an error at package installation is a big 
no-no for us.

Happy weekend

Ren&#233;
