<PRE>A colleague of mine has spent the better part of the last two days building RabbitMQ for our Solaris systems. He's run into numerous problems along the way, partly in thanks to Solaris, but today he finally had Erlang built and could move on to building RabbitMQ itself.

One part of the build had him quite stumped - it needed git! He spent some time building git (as the latest version didn't build and he had to look for an older version). Even then git failed to work properly for some of the checkouts (ugh), so he manually exported a snapshot of the appropriate repository. Then he realised that the RabbitMQ build was patching the git checkout using local patches.

That seems strange. Why not fork the git repositories in question and apply the patches there?

It also seems that the git pulls were for plugins that could've just been bundled with the RabbitMQ source.

These things aren't super annoying on their own, and certainly Solaris isn't helping, but as I mentioned this has been quite the laborious task for him to get everything built.
