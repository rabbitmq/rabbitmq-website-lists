I've done some ping tests between the two nodes and while an occasional packet will drop every once in awhile, it's not a really horrible connection. The average ping round trip time is areound 80ms.

</I>&gt;<i> I'd be surprised if it's a dropped packet, as the shutdown on both brokers seems to consistently take a long time. I just reproed this again, and one broker took 1000 seconds to shut down, while the other took 995. I have the logs from this repro, but a quick glance doesn't show anything radically different. Let me know if there's anything else I can supply.

Ok - do send the second pair of logs (or a scrubbed version if you need to hide private data) please, as we're keen to get to the bottom of this.
