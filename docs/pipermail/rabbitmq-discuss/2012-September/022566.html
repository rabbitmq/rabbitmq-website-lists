Hi.

I assume you mean &quot;...in response to queue.bind&quot;. There is - of course - 
a completely obvious case in response to queue.unbind.

&gt;<i> A very cursory glance at the source indicates that if I try to bind a

</I>&gt;<i>          false -&gt;  rabbit_misc:const({error, binding_not_found})

Not quite. The extra information is that in order to get there, we have 
to have gone past a point in add/2 where we already know that there is 
no binding in the rabbit_route table. So we only return 
binding_not_found if the binding is in rabbit_durable_route but not 
rabbit_route (and the binding is between two durable things and thus 
should be durable).

The idea is that rabbit_{route,queue} contains all effective 
bindings/queues, and rabbit_durable_{route,queue} contains all durable 
bindings/queues. It's obvious how something can be effective but not 
durable, but how can it be durable but not effective?

The answer is: when it points to a durable queue in a cluster which is 
located on a node which is down (or mirrored across a set of nodes all 
of which are down). In this circumstance (only) we will return NOT_FOUND 
to queue.declare and queue.bind operations.

And yes, there is already a bug open to make this clearer.

Cheers, Simon
