<PRE>Ben,

Yes and no :-)

In a perfect world it ought to be sufficient to state the version of  
the protocol the broker and the clients implements to assure they can  
talk to each other. If that didn't work it should be possible to find  
the misbehaving party and fix that like a bug. This would mean no meta  
release until the components comply with a new AMQP version.

While I do understand that the world doesn't work like this, I also  
think it is the right ideal to work towards. In fact I wouldn't  
surprise myself a lot if I some day claimed that not striving towards  
this ideal is the primary reason that many standards aren't worth the  
bytes used to store their description in.

So I guess what I'm worried about is that you will change your focus  
to much towards maintaining internal consistency between your own  
components and forget the standard compliance that should be a very  
important part of this.
