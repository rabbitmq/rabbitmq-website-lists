Hmm, I've been pondering this for a day now, and don't think the client 
as it is structured now could really deal with flow control.  I think 
something's going to have to give - either pure single-threadedness, SSL 
support using the stock Python libraries, or SSL support with Python 
versions less than 2.6

I think the easiest thing to do would be to have an optional mode that 
made use of another thread.  That could also allow for some other things 
like timeouts when receiving.

Don't think I'll get a chance to work on this in the next few days (busy 
with election stuff), but I'll keep pondering it.

In the meantime, anyone have thoughts as to what should happen on the 
client when the broker calls for pause...should the client buffer 
messages locally? or block and wait for a resume from the broker?  I 
suppose ideally there'd be options for both, but if you had to choose..?

     Barry
