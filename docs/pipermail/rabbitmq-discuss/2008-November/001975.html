I didn't say that I wouldn't look at it, I just said that I have a lot
of things to do on Rabbit and need to spread my efforts to be fair to
eveybody :-)

&gt;<i> but hey, this is a rabbit list, I only brought it up in order to share

</I>
It's perfectly fine to discuss this on the Rabbit list, IMHO.

&gt;<i> What could be in it for rabbit...

</I>&gt;<i> rabbit might just want to use metpx as a realy sympathetic protocol driver.
</I>&gt;<i>   Just looking for win-win... ymmv.
</I>
This is good to know.

&gt;<i> I would, except when I went to the AMQP lists I could see, they were dead.
</I>&gt;<i> maybe I didn't find the right ones.  The action seems to be over here, plus

</I>
I can't help you with the AMQP lists either, I don't know who runs
them. By posting to this list, you might get an answer, if it's not
official.
