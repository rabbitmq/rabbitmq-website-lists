</I>
The passive declaration of a queue tells you the number of messages 
present in the queue (and committed if the channel on which they were 
published is transacted) *that are not awaiting acknowledgement*.

When a client has subscribed to a queue with basic.consume, the queue 
will send it messages as fast as it can, until network back pressure 
kicks in.

So it is perfectly normal for there to be a discrepancy between the 
number of messages published vs the number of messages received + the 
message count returned by queue.declare-ok - the difference is accounted 
for by messages &quot;in flight&quot;.

&gt;<i> Two questions: why are messages being removed from the queue?
</I>
They are not actually being removed until an ack is received, but they 
are unavailable for consumption by another consumer.

&gt;<i> It doesn't seem like any messages are being acknowledged, so I wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> expect any messages to be dequeued.
</I>
Actually, in your example you are using ...

&gt;<i>   chan.basic_consume('toshred', no_ack=True, callback=consume)
</I>
with the no_ack flag set to True. That causes messages to be 
automatically &quot;self-acknowledged&quot; by the server. In other words, as soon 
as the queue has sent them on their way they are removed from the queue 
and gone for good.
