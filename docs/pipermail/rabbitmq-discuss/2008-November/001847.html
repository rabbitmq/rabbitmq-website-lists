I don't know if follow this. Are you saying that messages routed to
queues using a fanout exchange are not copied, rather each queue holds
a reference to each unique message?

</I>
I guess, but I don't want put my hand in the fire because I am not an
expert on this subject.

Essentially I am referring to an alternative to plain jane ACLs, for
example as described here:
<A HREF="http://www.eros-os.org/essays/ACLSvCaps.html">http://www.eros-os.org/essays/ACLSvCaps.html</A>

</I>
Sounds reasonable, plausible (and quite fine grained :-).

Hence there was an inclination to investigate capabilities - so that
access restrictions could be placed on an arbitrary entity as opposed
to having to classify types of objects and restrict them with an ACL.
