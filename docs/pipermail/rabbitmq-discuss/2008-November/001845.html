I see, so we wouldn't be able to take advantage of fanout exchanges?
Fanout exchanges seem efficiently implemented such that each queue
doesn't keep an individual copy of the message. If we can't use fanout
exchanges, that would seem to indiciate increased memory pressure on
the broker?

</I>&gt;<i> include a capability based mechanism.
</I>
Very interesting. Do you mean capabilities in the KeyKOS/E language sense?

&gt;<i> Contributions in the form of requirements and analysis (e.g. by
</I>&gt;<i> contributing to our wiki) or in the form of code, would help
</I>&gt;<i> accelerate the implementation.
</I>
I would be happy to give our motivations for we're hoping to achieve.
We want to be able to setup partners with access to queues where they
can read and ACK read items without being able to create new exchanges
or queues. We want a single user to be able to setup exchanges and
bind queues to that exchange.

Best,
Steve
