<PRE>All,

Some ideas for simplifying the exchange-binding model to address (NPI)
issues raised by eg Kirk, are being looked at for AMQP 1.0.  Although
we as a community are talking about code - and this is good - please
keep the use cases coming as people working on the spec will benefit
from them and may jump in.

Peter, in relation to routing patterns for headers or other content,
or indeed generalised active queries: the aim is to keep the core use
cases compact so that a reader can grok the spec in one or two reads.
Extensibility and pluggability and layering are hence the get-out for
enabling more cases while keeping a simple core.

What is wrong with extensible protocols?  Implementors may effectively
'fork' them by specialising in different add-ons.  But then these are
not ubiquitous (or even prevalent) and so do not get as much use.  So
there really is an incentive for implementors to make sure the *right*
core is there for widespread adoption - favouring a simple core.

In the case of RabbitMQ extensions a neat trick is to use the embedded
client to filter and relay in a 'smart' way, and process messages
without an extra network hop.  This is good.

</I>&gt;<i> This discussion (as an extension to the thread Kirk started) is going

</I>&gt;<i> trivial as you maintain, then please enlighten me with a proof of

</I>&gt;<i> to be AMQP specific, just something that shows the basr fundamental
</I>&gt;<i> routing lookup mechanism based on the data structures you are
</I>&gt;<i> proposing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Code speaks louder than words and I would love to be proven wrong.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the other hand,

</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does anyone else use complicated routing like us?  Does it sound like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something that AMQP might get to later?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regex exchanges have been discussed before and it would be reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> straight forward to implement, it would proabably look like the
</I>&gt;<i> current topic exchange. As you indicate, unless you something really
</I>&gt;<i> funky with your index, this would incur a linear scan of the bindings.
