Are you referring to amqp_clock.py?

If so, I think that the topic is a the name of a string variable:

TOPIC_PATTERN = '%Y.%m.%d.%w.%H.%M' # Python datetime.strftime() pattern
.....
topic = now.strftime(TOPIC_PATTERN)
ch.basic_publish(msg, EXCHANGE_NAME, routing_key=topic)

&gt;<i> If the key is a string, and the exchange_type is opaque to the producers,

</I>&gt;<i> oblivious to the routing method in use.
</I>&gt;<i> That's OK?
</I>
Yes, that will work.

&gt;<i> The next thing is that I need to be able to define routing to output queues

</I>
No, there is no fine grained access restriction (as discussed in other
threads on this list).

&gt;<i> I guess that is a function outside of AMQP (not a protocol thing, but rather
</I>&gt;<i> a broker function?)
</I>
Could be - again, a mechanism orthogonal to the protocol has been discussed.

&gt;<i>  I get the impression permissions/ACL's
</I>&gt;<i> were something applied at the queue/exchange level.  Was there
</I>&gt;<i> something granular enough to apply to individual messages sent to an
</I>&gt;<i> exchange blocking posting to queues based on routing_key?
</I>
AFAIK something as fine grained as this has not yet been investigated in detail.
