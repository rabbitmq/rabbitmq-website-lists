<PRE>Peter,

</I>
And thank-you for doing so.  As I mentioned this issue is very
valuable for 1.0 -- of which I hope to be able to say more soon.


&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The reason for me asking these questions is to understand how to add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; AMQP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; support to metpx.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are you more interested in implementing some form of the AMQP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model/codec in metpx or are you interested in being a consumer of AMQP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (e.g. via Rabbit)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm hoping one of my developers can do a producer to speak to rabbit.   I
</I>&gt;<i> would send a single, un-differentiated product stream, and pilot having a
</I>&gt;<i> few clients (internal first, external later) use the consumer of their
</I>&gt;<i> choice to acquire the messages.   I have a business need that no other
</I>&gt;<i> package (including metpx) currently fills, that rabbit seems, at first
</I>&gt;<i> blush, perfect for.
</I>
Sounds most excellent :-)


&gt;<i> What could be in it for rabbit...
</I>&gt;<i> Does rabbit want some protocol drivers?  We have solid ones for FTP and
</I>&gt;<i> SFTP. I doubt you'd be interested in the others...
</I>
I am extremely interested in protocol drivers including file transfer.
 They are just .... useful!

As you may have noticed there are others - see the RabbitMQ universe
in the presentation here:
<A HREF="http://google-ukdev.blogspot.com/2008/09/rabbitmq-tech-talk-at-google-london.html">http://google-ukdev.blogspot.com/2008/09/rabbitmq-tech-talk-at-google-london.html</A>



&gt;<i> rabbit might just want to use metpx as a realy sympathetic protocol driver.
</I>&gt;<i>   Just looking for win-win... ymmv.
</I>
We often find unexpected benefits from providing adaptors.  Often it's
best to not predict and just put up an example and see what happens.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the former is the case, then maybe approaching the AMQP working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> group might prove more fruitful that speaking to an implementer of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AMQP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would, except when I went to the AMQP lists I could see, they were dead.
</I>&gt;<i> maybe I didn't find the right ones.  The action seems to be over here, plus
</I>&gt;<i> the whole routing thing was just an aside from reading the above, my aim is
</I>&gt;<i> what was described above.
