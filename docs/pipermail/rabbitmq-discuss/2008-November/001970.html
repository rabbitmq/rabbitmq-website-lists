I don't know If I'm the best qualified person to do this. Due to the
fact however that I have a large backlog of Rabbit specific items to
get through, this will have to be appended to that queue, so I won't
be able to look at this straight away. You might get a response from
somebody else on the list, hence why I forwarded this mail.

Are you more interested in implementing some form of the AMQP
model/codec in metpx or are you interested in being a consumer of AMQP
(e.g. via Rabbit)?

If the former is the case, then maybe approaching the AMQP working
group might prove more fruitful that speaking to an implementer of
AMQP.
