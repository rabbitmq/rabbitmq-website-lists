OK, I've added a donate button to the lettuce site so that you can
take care of your Rabbit :-)

</I>
That wasn't a design deficiency, that's just how we chose to implement
it. Design-wise, it is reasonably easy to incorporate.

&gt;<i>- but I think it's reasonable to say that it's
</I>&gt;<i> time to spend the estimated 3 work-weeks (I assume 120 work-hours) to remedy
</I>&gt;<i> this. The cost of this should not be extreme. Let me put my project-manager

</I>&gt;<i> $10K to fix this (if I am wrong, and the rates are higher than that, PLEASE
</I>&gt;<i> can I work for you? ;).
</I>
10K would probably do it, but that's not our daily rate -   we'd do it
because of the cause.

Yes, we could probably outsource some AS/400 stuff to you ;-)

&gt;<i> Is there a way you could beg, borrow or
</I>&gt;<i> venture-capital this to fast-track it?
</I>
