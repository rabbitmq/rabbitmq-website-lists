Nevermind, the reason is that the documentation is missing the $options
hash description for get(). To fix it, one needs to add { no_ack => 0 } if
you're using transactions.

Hi,

The guys at my previous company The NetCircle just open sourced a project
called "Consumer Dispatcher" which can be used to manage RabbitMQ consumers.

The "what" and "why" can be seen here:

What buffers the messages? The app? Bunny? The kernel?

The CPU hike surely should last only a fraction of a second, given that 
a rabbit client ought to be able to publish messages at a rate of tens 
of kHz.

You'd either have to patch Bunny or the app, depending on where the 
buffering occurs.

There's nothing that allows you to look inside a queue without touching it.

The management plugin lets you view messages from a queue; but it does 
this by consuming them in ack mode then closing the connection - so all 
such messages get their redelivered flag set. (And if another process is 
consuming from the queue at the time, things may get reordered.)

Cheers, Simon

As Simon asked previously, *what* is growing in memory and eventually 
crashing? The client/app or the RabbitMQ server? If it's the former I 
suggest you use one the Java memory profilers to figure out where the 
memory is going.

that sounds a smart way for checking the queues.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Rabbitmq 2.8.2 crash using node-amqp client
Message-ID: <20120601134436.73a7a7d2@gmail.com>

Hello,

Rabbitmq is crashing with one of these messages:
Slogan: binary_alloc: Cannot allocate 245000040 bytes of memory (of type
"binary"). 
in /var/lib/rabbitmq/erl_crash.dump
or killed by OOM killer:
Out of memory: Kill process 29165 (beam) score 889 or sacrifice child

I attached the script I used to stress it with. If it doesn't crash,
try to start 2 instances of this script. The script is wrote in node.js
and uses the node-amqp library.

If you need details don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you,
  Andrei Vereha

Well it *is* possible to crash the vm by exhausting all available memory 
and/or triggering the OOM Killer on Linux. Take a read of 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html for more details on how to manage this.

I read the page above, and it seems that the vm_memory_high_watermark
has no effect in this case.
Configuration:

[{rabbit, [{vm_memory_high_watermark, 0.2}]}].

The log file says:

=INFO REPORT==== 1-Jun-2012::14:01:45 ===
vm_memory_high_watermark set. Memory used:105251880 allowed:103223296

=INFO REPORT==== 1-Jun-2012::14:01:45 ===
    alarm_handler:
{set,{{resource_limit,memory,'rabbit at rabbitmq-03'},[]}}

When I look into the management interface the connections are in
"running" state, though the memory alarm is triggered(the memory
section is red in the overview interface). And the memory usage is just
growing. 

When I try to send a big message from python using Pika, I cannot
reproduce the crash. That's why I attached the example client in
node.js.

Thank you,
 Andrei

Your memory limit is too low for this.

A message's size should not be greater than a 10th (or in extremis 1/4) 
of the available RAM. Where is your Pika code?

Yes, that's true. If a single message can take you from under the 
watermark to out of memory, we won't stop it being accepted. We're going 
to look into this.

Yes this is correct. Having a client is enough, as long as there is a 
broker running somewhere for you to connect to. Obviously you'll need a 
client consuming and a client production (i.e., publishing) messages if 
you're going to see anything useful happen. :)

That's probably just incidental.

You are right. I retried with the python client and after a while the
server crashed. I attached the script.

Now, i'm not sure what I need to do to ensure that i'm acknowledging only

through the documentation to see if there are any pointers. Can someone 
point me in the right direction ? My spring-rabbit config shown below :

Can you provide a little more context - under what conditions are you seeing this; what version of spring-rabbit are you using?

Can you provide more log data, before the condition occurs?

Thanks

Hi Paul, thanks for this.

So something is rather suspicious. You have few queues / connections / 
channels, but a lot of process memory is in use. And there are a lot of 
processes (787, which is not a lot in the grand scheme of things but is 
a lot when idle).

And you have a run_queue of 261 (very approximate equivalent of load 
average), which is very high indeed. So all those processes are doing 
something.

This is, of course, not a good situation to be in.

Could you alter your cron job to include:

rabbitmqctl eval 
'lists:sublist(lists:reverse(lists:sort([{process_info(Pid,memory), Pid, 
process_info(Pid), process_info(Pid, current_stacktrace)} || Pid<- 
processes()])), 50).'

so that we can try to see what on earth these processes are?

Cheers, Simon

Hi,

Would it be possible to create a Queue on a Local n/w and let the cloud application to post the message on to the local Queue, we are using Rabbit.

?We have a business case that the lables need to be printed from a Vfabric tc server to a local printer offline in no time. One solution is to use a Cloud printer like HP eprint but this is relatively slower . is there a better way to print files from Cloud to a local printer?

Just thinking about, moving the content from Cloud to Local printer thru Rabbit, would it be possible ?


Thanks in Advance

Yeah I could understand if it was happening after the thousandth, or maybe
even the hundredth message, but tenth? Why would it slow down after just
ten messages?

The messages are indeed getting to rabbitmq, but very slowly.

If I use pika twisted I don't get this problem at all.

Does not look too good:

http://just-ping.com/index.php?vh=rabbitmq.com&c=&s=ping%21&vtt=1338771909&vhost=_&c=

100% packet loss from pretty much everywhere. Could still be cached
with some providers, maybe this is why some still see the page.

Yep, and some people is complaining over twitter that they can't get
apt-get to install rabbitmq due to this issue.

Absence of ping has no real meaning whatsoever any longer. A significant
number of ISPs or in-house networks filter all ICMP Echo packets.
I have no trouble accessing the site from Germany, and there is nothing
cached.

I just tried from my company internet connection, still in Z?rich. No
access.

Then I asked a sysadmin friend to try from Shanghai. He can't access it
neither from there nor from a VPN to Amsterdam. According to what he could
see the server is an Apache that can't access its backend, so the problem
seems to be in whatever backend is behind Apache.

I'm from South China.
Accessing rabbitmq.com is just normal.
Also you can try to access it from many locations with this site: 17ce.com

Thank-you for this info.  Can you please ask your friend to send over
any traces, files, dumps etc that show this?

Hi,

I tried pangj recommendation, you can see the results here:
http://17ce.com/site/http/25a47ff85452243847d360a4f6e4b853.html

Some parts of China give green, some others red, notably Shanghai and
Nanjing.

I can't tell from here, but this could be a DNS problem.  I noticed
that the ip I get for www.rabbitmq.com resolves to an IP with
inconsistent forward and reverse DNS answers.  Shouldn't be a problem,
but might help anyone with internal access narrow in on the actual
problem.

We're getting 504 "Gateway Timeout" errors, in addition to
intermittent connectivity.

I did a bit of tracerouting and testing here: http://www.site24x7.com/

looks like the problem is dependent on the upstream. traffic going
through att seems to work whereas traffic coming through noanet seems
to fail. interesting enough the monitoring location of zoho in NZ
seems to route through noanet (site fails) whereas my connection in
the office comes through att and the site works.

cheers

Here is a capture from just now. The server hasn't run out of memory 
yet, but the CPU has been spiked at about 400% (4 core server) for 
awhile now:

$ sudo rabbitmqctl report | grep processes
           {processes,63913966},
           {processes_used,63881216},
  {processes,[{limit,1048576},{used,774}]},

And here is the output of your eval:

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] can rabbitmq be used in the bank business?
Message-ID: <4FCDAC3B.4050603@riseup.net>

Hi,

We currently primarily use rabbitmq in statistics work.
One of our business has the UV (unique visitor) of 200,000 - 30,000 each 
day.
The web servers receive the user's requests, and write the result to 
Rabbitmq.
The backend Hadoop servers read the result from Rabbitmq and compute and 
generate the statistics report.
In this case Rabbitmq works perfectly, we didn't find a problem.
My question is, can rabbitmq run for high serious business? for example, 
the bank business, they require very high reliability.
If so, do you have any suggestions?

Thanks.

Hello,

I want to know is there any guide or manual for setup the rabbitmq 
system for very high reliability, I mean it can't loss even a message in 
the production environment. Each message is maybe, for example, a 
million USD. Thanks.

Regards.

Just a broken routing table in some backbone router somewhere out there 
then.

Message-ID: <16278ca4-9168-4727-8fa0-83768857a200@googlegroups.com>

Hi,
we are running into trouble with our rabbitmq setup. The beam.smp process 
segfaults on us:

[11808657.334491] beam.smp[18806]: segfault at fffffffffffffffe ip 
0000000000522843 sp 00007fc11ab8acf0 error 4 in beam.smp[400000+1c6000]

This is with RabbitMQ version 2.8.2 but this also happened with 2.7.1 and 
we hoped an upgrade to 2.8.2 would maybe fix this but apparently it didn't.
All of this is running on a Centos 6.2 with the latest erlang R14B packages 
from the EPEL repo.

Any ideas what we can do to fix this?

Regards,
  Dennis

This looks like an Erlang runtime problem. You can get RPM packages for all R14 and R15 releases
from http://www.erlang-solutions.com/section/132/download-erlang-otp

Have you looked at the RabbitMQ book "RabbitMQ in Action"?  This
probably has the most complete manual for this.

There is also info on the Rabbit web site.  Have a look at the
sections on clustering and high availability, as well as the sections
on queue durability and message persistence.

The packages on that site are not compatible with the rabbitmq rpms.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] memory overflow behavior
Message-ID: <a5ab01ec-c08d-488e-abe5-d6c1ed996d4d@googlegroups.com>

Did a test with posting messages to a queue that no one is reading from, 
far beyond the high memory watermark. The behavior at that point for rabbit 
was to start moving queue contents to disk, throttling the producer and 
keeping the memory usage in a good shape. However when a client finally 
tried to connect to read from the queue, it looked like the rabbit node 
tried to load everything that was offloaded to disk back to memory at the 
same time, before starting to serve the client. Could this be done as an 
incremental process?

Message-ID: <BF9635CFDD836844A32D34D5D635B4B729FC3159E3@ATT1-MBX2.global.amec.com>



Hi all

I am trying to configure RabbitMQ on Oracle Linux 64-bit (latest version 6.2)

I could not find RPMs for RabbitMQ and Erlang so I compiled everything from scratch and got RabbitMQ up and running. Below is the output of RabbitMQ on my VM.

AMQP 0-9-1 / 0-9 / 0-8
Copyright (C) 2007-2012 VMware, Inc.
Licensed under the MPL. See http://www.rabbitmq.com/

node : rabbit at flanker
app descriptor : /usr/local/rabbitmq/sbin/../ebin/rabbit.app
home dir : /root
config file(s) : (none)
cookie hash : ijr/uCKNx6qvaM2IVt/Mmw==
log : /var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit at flanker.log
sasl log : /var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit at flanker-sasl.log
database dir : /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit at flanker
erlang version : 5.9.1


I am trying to do the Python RabbitMQ tutorial and just cannot seem to get it to work. Below is the code in my send.py and receive.py

send.py
--------

#!/usr/bin/env python
import pika

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters( host='flanker'))
channel = connection.channel()

channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')

channel.basic_publish(exchange='',
routing_key='hello',
body='Hello World!')
print "[x] Sent 'Hello World!'"
connection.close()



receive.py
-----------
#!/usr/bin/env python
import pika

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(
host='flanker'))
channel = connection.channel()

channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')

print '[*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C'

def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
print " [x] Received %r" % (body,)

channel.basic_consume(callback,
queue='hello',
no_ack=True)

channel.start_consuming()



When I do send.py, I get the following in /var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit at flanker.log

=INFO REPORT==== 5-Jun-2012::10:01:05 ===
accepting AMQP connection <0.450.0> (127.0.0.1:39162 -> 127.0.0.1:5672)


However no messages are showing up in the recieve.py window and also

[root at flanker rabbitmq]# /usr/local/sbin/rabbitmqctl list_queues
Listing queues ...
hello 0
...done.


Always shows 0.

Any ideas? I am a rabbitmq newbie and not sure what I am doing wrong. Obviously missing a config step or a permission somewhere....

Any help is highly appreciated.

Thanks!

Hi,

Would it be possible to create a Queue on a Local n/w and let the cloud application to post the message on to the local Queue, we are using Rabbit.

?We have a business case that the lables need to be printed from a Vfabric tc server to a local printer offline in no time. One solution is to use a Cloud printer like HP eprint but this is relatively slower . is there a better way to print files from Cloud to a local printer?

Just thinking about, moving the content from Cloud to Local printer thru Rabbit, would it be possible ?


Thanks in Advance
J

I am contemplating of using your library in a small but potentially very 
hight transaction activity project - 200+ transactions per second. I have 
several quick questions:
1. so far what are the weakest points of the library? Is there anything 
external which causes consistent issues or bottlenecks such as: php, 
libevent... any recorded application freezes, bottlenecks, memory leaks etc.
2. have you done any benchmarking, could you share any numbers?
3. do you intend to maintain this code going forward. From your note it is 
clear that you have other priorities at the moment?
 
Thanks,
JRA

Message-ID: <9C2464101709B84785BAD99CFC4B69A20878063C@SUSIAALEXMB1.FCStone.com>

Hello,

I have a long  running, durable, non-auto-delete, non-exclusive, RabbitMq consumer (.Net client) that works perfectly unless a 15 minute (+- approximately 3 seconds) period of inactivity occurs.  After 15 minutes of messaging inactivity a "System.IO.EndOfStreamException: SharedQueue closed" exception is thrown (and continues to be thrown for each subsequent call to <model>.BasicConsume()).  Is this the expected behavior?  I am using NoAck = true for each dequeue..

Thank you,

Message-ID: <4FCED3AE.2070102@riseup.net>

Hello,

I saw this statement:

A node can be a RAM node or a disk node. RAM nodes keep their state only 
in memory (with the exception of the persistent contents of durable 
queues which are still stored safely on disc). Disk nodes keep state in 
memory and on disk.

So what does the "state" mean above?

Thanks.

Hi Walter,

When you say 'non-auto-delete' do you mean to say there is not TTL 
specified on the messages?
I also wondered if you have AMQP heartbeats enabled - see 
http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2012-May/020236.html for 
a discussion of this - as that could cause a connection to be terminated 
after a specified period of inactivity.

I'll have a look in the .NET client code, as this doesn't seem like the 
exception class I'd expect to be thrown in a heartbeat timeout 
situation, but I thought it was worth mentioning just in case.

If possible, can you tell us exactly (scratching any private data such 
as the broker, queue and/or exchange names of course) what parameters 
you're passing to declare the queue and exchange(s) as well as the 
consumer set up?

Cheers,
Tim

It means the declared queues, exchanges and bindings, plus one of two 
other bits. Someone more familiar with the contents of the database can 
fill in the hand-wavy 'one or two other bits' if you're interested. :)

So the database also contains information about users, permissions, 
vhosts, routing tables (bindings that I already mentioned) plus some 
runtime data structures which are used for internal book keeping 
purposes. The precise list of tables can be seen here: 
http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server/file/default/src/rabbit_mnesia.erl#l226.

Looking further at the client code, I can see that the heartbeat is 
implemented on the client as well as the server. If this times out, we 
do indeed get an EndOfStreamException (with a message like "Heartbeat 
missing with heartbeat == <n> seconds") - see 
http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/file/default/projects/client/RabbitMQ.Client/src/client/impl/ConnectionBase.cs#l541 
for the details.

Looking at the SharedQueue class, I can see that once closed, it will 
continuously throw this exception whenever you try to dequeue. So this 
looks like a possible cause to me. Can you verify whether or not you've 
got AMQP heartbeat timeouts enabled?

Cheers,
Tim

I'd like to specifically restrict specific ssl ciphers acceptable to

in the rabbitmq.config file as an ssl_option the right way to go about
doing this?

Yes, you can find the available ciphers by running
rabbitmqctl eval 'ssl:cipher_suites().'
and adding specifying you selection as the "ciphers" parameter.
Make sure that clients and broker have at least one cipher in common.

The Erlang SSL page has more details:

Yes, it is possible to declare a queue on a local broker and publish
messages to an exchange that routes to that queue. The first tutorial
explains how to do that:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html

I don't see why not. What you will need is an AMQP client that consumes
print job messages from the broker and submits them to the printer in
whatever format your printer supports.

	Fairness
Message-ID: <CAJaLo3Dvdm7FME5oN2TCQf3TqakeDxdEBK2OaDjTX97n3Jkf8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have 1 broker, 1 consumer, many queues. the queues are arbitrary such as
ACCOUNT_ID.1 ACCOUNT_ID.2 etc. I'm trying to avoid 1 account flooding its
queue and starving the other accounts.

If the queues look like this (items in array are the messages)

ACCOUNT_ID.1 = [ 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d ]
ACCOUNT_ID.2 = [ 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d ]
ACCOUNT_ID.3 = [ 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d ]

I want the consumer to receive messages in a fair order such as = 1a, 2a,
3a, 1b, 2b, 3b, ...

Can i achieve above scenario via rabbitmq? If yes how would I do this?

Thanks.

Can you please let us know what steps you have taken to diagnose the
problem, e.g. have you ruled out hardware problems as a cause?

Was HiPE enabled? If so then turn it off.

Is the stack trace identical in each case?

How repeatable is the error?

Is it repeatable if you turn SMP support off (by supplying the "-smp
disable" flag to the "erl" command)?
See http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl.html#smp

What was the broker doing at the time of the segfault? Was there
anything in the broker log or the sasl log at the time?

At what point did the errors start - when you upgraded to v2.7.1?
What was the last combination of software that did not produce segfaults?


Hopefully your answers lead to a solution, otherwise we might need to
enlist the help of the Erlang authors by referring your question to the
erlang-questions mailing list.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss]  Transaction
Message-ID: <33968899.post@talk.nabble.com>


Good morning.

I have the following problem. In my application I have the following message
flow.

1) A publisher sends a message to a queue "A".
2) A subcriptor receives the message from queue "A" and send this message to
the process "P".
3) In the process "P" I send a message to the queue "B".
4) The subcriptor which received the message sends the ACK to RabbitMQ. 

The subcriptor uses a channel "C1" to process messages in the point 2. And
the point 3 is sent the message to the queue "B" through another channel
"C2".

I would like the ACK sent by the channel "C1" belonged the same transaction
that the publication of the message by the channel "C2", that is showed in
the point 3. Is it possible?. I have only seen  transactions in the same
channel. Not by connection.

Why do I want this?. May be that I send the publication showed in section 3
and the machine crash. Then the ack of subcriptor will not be sent. Then the
"P" process re-processing the previous message and re-send the same message
showed in the point 3. Duplicating messages.

Thanks

Hi,

May I ask the ack is sent automatically, or by hand with a method call?

I ask this because, my test script below, I don't know if the Perl 
client has sent an ACK to broker or not, when it finish receiving and 
handling the message.

use strict;
use Net::RabbitMQ;

my $channel = 1001;
my $queuename = "myqueue";
my $mq = Net::RabbitMQ->new();

$mq->connect("localhost", { vhost=>"/myhost", user => "***", password => 
"***" });
$mq->channel_open($channel);

while (1) {
     my $hashref = $mq->get($channel, $queuename);
     last unless defined $hashref;
     print $hashref->{message_count}, ": ", $hashref->{body},"\n";
}

$mq->disconnect();


Thanks.

Hi. 2.4 is too old I'm afraid; you need at least 2.6 (and, umm, not 3).

rabbitmqadmin should probably detect this.

The ack is handled with the method.

The pseudocode will be something like this:

channel1.Open("queueA")
channel2.Open("queueB")

While (true)
   message = channel1.Receive()
   message2 = process(message) // Process message
   channel2.Send(message2)
   channel1.Ack
End While

I would like this below in the same transaction:

   channel2.Send(message2)
   channel1.Ack

Sorry, I use dot net. 

Thanks

Hi,

I have several questions about RabbitMQ below, please help.
I have been using Ruby and Perl for programming.

* What's the difference between "consume" and "get" for a consumer?
* Where to setup the message acknowledgment?
* If message acknowledgment is enabled, will the consumer send the ACK 
automatically, or by a method call?
* Any guide for transaction? for example, commit and rollback a transaction.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Application architecture question: queue failure
Message-ID: <CAKhN_m7LSCJHx7NcnoNnWGxErf+UD20dmAuTQi5s2GMUoHk6yQ@mail.gmail.com>

We try and design our architecture (for a large web application) in a way
that we expect any part to fail: "design for failure".   There's parts of
our system that are prime for RabbitMQ but the concern is that a message
must never be lost -- even when RabbitMQ is setup for HA.

So, designing for that rare situation that a message might get lost, my
approach has been to maintain state on the application.  When I send a
message to get some work down I flag it as "in process" or "pending" with a
start time and a retry counter.  I can then (say with cron) find the
uncompleted tasks that have been waiting for some value of too long.

But, then the problem is what to do with that information?  How do I know
that the message is really lost and not just backed up in the queue?  Don't
want to queue it again in this case as it just compounds the problem (and
then if the first job finally completes the state of the wrong message is
updated).

That, and I frankly think the overhead of my state tracking is possibly
more problematic than the potential for a loss of a message.

Anyway, sorry if this is a mundane (if not a bit off-topic) question -- and
I know it's application-specific. But, it's a question that comes up often
in our design discussions.

Do you have these concerns and how do you handle the possibility of message
or queue loss?

Thanks,

Excellent. Just the info we needed.

The problem you are seeing turns out to be a process leak in HA queues - 
when such queues are deleted not all associated Erlang processes are 
terminated and they eat up increasing amounts of memory and processing 
resources.

A fix should appear in the next release. Meanwhile, if you tweak your 
tests s.t. they do not create HA queues that would allow us to confirm 
whether we are on the right track here.

Regards,

Matthias.

You may want to send the above questions directly to Robin Harvey, the

That makes sense. We use these same queue configurations in both our 
production and manual testing environments. We hardly ever delete and 
recreate the queues there, and these servers have been running for 
months with no problems.

Thanks for getting to the bottom of the problem. We will upgrade when 
the next version comes out.

Hi Tim,

I am not explicitly setting the TTL when creating the queue.  Looking over the TTL docs, it looks like declaring the queue with "x-expires" set to a very large (long-long-int) number would effectively fix the issue.  I'll give that a shot this morning.

I have confirmed via logging that Heartbeat = 0 in the .Net client connection.

It is probably also worth mentioning that this is occurring on an SSL connection.  The exchange is manually configured via the Management plugin web interface using the following parameters:

Type: topic
Durable: true

The queue is created with the following parameters:

QueueName: <ApplicationName>.<ProcessName>.<ConsumerName>
Durable: true
Exclusive: false
AutoDelete: false
Arguments: null

The queue is bound to a number of filters of the form <ApplicationName>.<ProcessName>.<ProducerName> which can be on several different exchanges.  The queue name, routing keys, and key bindings are all managed with an internally developed toolset.

Thank you,

Hi Walter,

When you say 'non-auto-delete' do you mean to say there is not TTL specified on the messages?
I also wondered if you have AMQP heartbeats enabled - see http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2012-May/020236.html for a discussion of this - as that could cause a connection to be terminated after a specified period of inactivity.
Looking further at the client code, I can see that the heartbeat is implemented on the client as well as the server. If this times out, we do indeed get an EndOfStreamException (with a message like "Heartbeat missing with heartbeat == <n> seconds") - see http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/file/default/projects/client/RabbitMQ.Client/src/client/impl/ConnectionBase.cs#l541 for the details.

Looking at the SharedQueue class, I can see that once closed, it will continuously throw this exception whenever you try to dequeue. So this looks like a possible cause to me. Can you verify whether or not you've got AMQP heartbeat timeouts enabled?

Cheers,
Tim


I'll have a look in the .NET client code, as this doesn't seem like the exception class I'd expect to be thrown in a heartbeat timeout situation, but I thought it was worth mentioning just in case.

If possible, can you tell us exactly (scratching any private data such as the broker, queue and/or exchange names of course) what parameters you're passing to declare the queue and exchange(s) as well as the consumer set up?

Cheers,
Tim

Thank you!

Follow up question: Is the denial of anything other then the chosen ciphers
after ssl negotiation?  In other words, if I set up only 3 specific ciphers
to be supported can, say, a compliance security guy come along and scan the
box with a saint server or some such will he only see the 3 options, or
will it spit out all of them as supported but log somewhere that X cipher
was rejected.  In other words, is the only way to really test this to do a
full connection test and watch the logs go by for cipher rejection or
connection messages?

The configured value should constrain the advertised ciphers during
negotiation, so you should be able to determine the effect easily by
observing the advertisement. The amount of testing you perform should be
dictated by the desired level of confidence.

Message-ID: <CAAqmy6OhW7xEHr-zYswvjFNeZKjnsVYJ1ZmLubxyh4XarfStcQ@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to specify a connection timeout when using the dotnet client
as it appears that when the broker is unreachable, my calls to
CreateConnection() block indefinitely.

ConnectionFactory cf = new ConnectionFactory ();
cf.HostName = "192.168.96.129";
var conn = cf.CreateConnection ();

Is there a way to specify the timeout in the ConnectionFactory?

The x-expires extension controls queue lifetime, whereas x-message-ttl 
controls the dwell time for messages before they get discarded. I'm not 
convinced this has anything to do with the behaviour you specified, as 
if it isn't currently set then nothing should be causing the queue to be 
removed (and as you've not said otherwise, I'm assuming that the queue 
survives this disconnection of the consumer).

Ok - that seemed like a logical candidate but perhaps it's a red 
herring. It does 'sound' like some kind of timeout/expiry is happening, 
but if there's no heartbeat set then perhaps that's not the case.

I'd be surprised to find that any of those (latter) things is at the

Hi Walter,

Can you please try *enabling* heartbeats - as their whole purpose is to 
ensure that the connection stays alive for long enough - and let us know 
if that resolves the problem?

Tim

Actually I've mis-stated that. AMQP heartbeats are also used by the broker to deal with 'misbehaving' clients, but either way, they should help with your situation I hope.

Hi,

The connection attempt should not block indefinitely. If you wait long
enough it should timeout.

It is not currently possible to specify a connection timeout, and the
higher-level TcpClient API doesn't make it easy to add one. This is on
our to-do list though.

The one is asynchronous and the other synchronous. When a client uses
"consume" the broker will deliver messages as soon as any are available,
while with "get" the client needs to poll the broker.

> * Where to setup the message acknowledgment?

Clients decide on this via the "no-ack" parameter of the "basic.consume"
or "basic.get" methods.

http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.consume.no-ack
http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.get.no-ack

> * If message acknowledgment is enabled, will the consumer send the ACK 
> automatically, or by a method call?

If the consumer set "no-ack/auto-ack" true then the broker will not
expect acknowledgements from the consumer.
If the consumer set "no-ack/auto-ack" false then the consumer must
acknowledge messages using the basic.ack method:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-quickref.html#basic.ack

Also see section "2.1.2.1 Message Life-cycle" in the 0.9.1 AMQP
specification for a more detailed description.

Transactions are discouraged, but see this for more details:

Publisher confirms are recommended instead of transactions:

Messages are only paged back into memory as needed, i.e. rabbit is 
already doing what you suggest. So there must be some other explanation 
for the behaviour you saw.

If you want to guarantee that order then you can open three channels, 
set the prefetch count to 1 on each, and consume from one queue on each 
channel. Then ack the message from 1, then from 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 etc.

That's not the fastest way to go, but it will be the fairest.

Hi, right now I have a working example of Json rpc channel usage.
The problem is that when client have any connection problems, we receive Jsonrpc error and polling requests just stop.
I am looking for easy and proper way to handle transport errors and retry (or continue) listening.

Humm, so for our specific setup we added the following options to
rabbitmq.config:

[
 {rabbit,[
 {tcp_listeners,[5672]},
 {ssl_listeners,[5671]},
 {ssl_options,[{cacertfile,"/
etc/rabbitmq/certs/ca-bundle.crt"},
 {certfile,"/etc/rabbitmq/certs/rabbitmq.crt"},
 {keyfile,"/etc/rabbitmq/certs/rabbitmq.key"},
 {verify,verify_none},
 {fail_if_no_peer_cert,false}]},
 {ciphers,[{dhe_rsa,aes_256_cbc,sha},
 {dhe_dss,aes_256_cbc,sha},
 {rsa,aes_256_cbc,sha}]}
 ]},
{rabbit, [{vm_memory_high_watermark, 0.5}]}
].

Our security compliance guy pointed his saint server at it and it returned
a whole bunch of extra ciphers it claimed to support.

Supported ciphers:
RC4-MD5:TLSv1/SSLv3:128-bit
RC4-SHA:TLSv1/SSLv3:128-bit
DES-CBC-SHA:TLSv1/SSLv3:*56-bit *
DES-CBC3-SHA:TLSv1/SSLv3:168-bit
EDH-RSA-DES-CBC-SHA:TLSv1/SSLv3:*56-bit *
EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:TLSv1/SSLv3:168-bit
AES128-SHA:TLSv1/SSLv3:128-bit
DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:TLSv1/SSLv3:128-bit
AES256-SHA:TLSv1/SSLv3:256-bit
DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:TLSv1/SSLv3:256-bit

Does our rabbitmq.config look wrong to you?

Thanks a billion!

If your email client is able to preserve the indentation and render with
a fixed width font then you will see what's wrong:

[{rabbit,[{tcp_listeners,[5672]},
          {ssl_listeners,[5671]},
          {ssl_options,[{cacertfile,".../certs/ca-bundle.crt"},
                        {certfile,".../certs/rabbitmq.crt"},
                        {keyfile,".../certs/rabbitmq.key"},
                        {verify,verify_none},
                        {fail_if_no_peer_cert,false}]},
          {ciphers,[{dhe_rsa,aes_256_cbc,sha},
                    {dhe_dss,aes_256_cbc,sha},
                    {rsa,aes_256_cbc,sha}]}]},
 {rabbit,[{vm_memory_high_watermark,0.5}]}].

The "ciphers" configuration should be under "ssl_options" and you have a
duplicate "rabbit" section. If you correct these then the configuration
will take effect.

Hey Tim,

Enabling heartbeats seems to have helped with my issue.  Making this change triggered the Socket ObjectDisposedException problem discussed at http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2012-March/018767.html.  Updating to the most recent build on NuGet appears to have cleared that issue up as well.  Will monitor for a few days before declaring victory.

Thank you for your help,

Actually I've mis-stated that. AMQP heartbeats are also used by the broker to deal with 'misbehaving' clients, but either way, they should help with your situation I hope.

Confirmed!

We are now only accepting those specified ciphers.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Splitting published messages to a body and
	no-body part
Message-ID: <4FD10654.5020507@fsn.hu>

Hi,

I have a publish-subscribe application, where the producer must send two 
message types to two types of consumers:
1. this message type has some headers, which contain meta-data about the 
body, but doesn't contain the body itself
2. like the first, but it actually contains the body

There are two type of consumers accordingly: the first, which must only 
see the headers, but not the body, and the second, which must see both 
(headers and body).
The suboptimal solution is to produce these two types of messages, 
effectively doubling the incoming rate.
The optimal solution would be some kind of routing, where the second 
type of incoming messages (only this type is produced, with full body 
and headers) split into two queues, one with and one without the body.

Is this possible with RabbitMQ (without writing a plugin for this of 
course)?

Afraid not, that's the sort of thing you'd need a plugin for.

Hi, sorry for such a simple question...
I had written some interface code in C using openAMQ - but I've now
realised that looks like its been canned - so I'm looking at porting to
something else...

I can get my head around putting stuff into the exchanges/queues etc*
*(amq_basic_publish)
from this code :


  char *messagebody="Hello World";
  ...
    amqp_basic_properties_t props;
    props._flags = AMQP_BASIC_CONTENT_TYPE_FLAG |
AMQP_BASIC_DELIVERY_MODE_FLAG;
    props.content_type = amqp_cstring_bytes("text/plain");
    props.delivery_mode = 2; /* persistent delivery mode */
    die_on_error(amqp_basic_publish(conn,
                                    1,
                                    amqp_cstring_bytes(exchange),
                                    amqp_cstring_bytes(routingkey),
                                    0,
                                    0,
                                    &props,
                                    amqp_cstring_bytes(messagebody)),
                 "Publishing");


but pulling data off is escaping me atm..

Whats the **simplest way** of getting that data, as a full string I can
then process ?
(All the examples seem to do strange things with frames/frame headers etc)
..

Ideally - I want to replace my existing :

#define BUFFSIZE 10000
 char message_text[BUFFSIZE];

 content = amq_client_session_basic_arrived (session);
 message_size = amq_content_basic_get_body (content,
                                             (byte *)
                                             message_text,
                                             sizeof (message_text));



and - so far I've only got as far as :

   #define BUFFSIZE 10000
   char message_text[BUFFSIZE];

   amqp_simple_wait_frame(conn, &frame);


;)



Any help, or pointers to some documentation would be much appreciated !

Unfortunately the API for rabbitmq-c is rather low-level when it comes to
reading messages from the broker, so when using amqp_basic_get() or
amqp_basic_consume(), you will have to deal with reading individual frames
to read the header and message body.

Off the top of my head here's what you'd need to read a message off the
wire using amqp_basic_get() (Note: this is off the top of my head, and
doesn't deal with error handling well (just returns).  This is also using
basic.get - which is a synchronous method of getting messages. For anything
non-trivial, you probably want use amqp_basic_consume.

  amqp_rpc_reply_t reply =
    amqp_basic_get(
      connection,
      1, /* channel id */
      amqp_cstring_bytes("queue name"),
      0); /* no_ack, the message will automatically be acked as its
delievered */

  if (reply.reply_type != AMQP_RESPONSE_NORMAL)
    return; /* bad reponse from broker */

  if (reply.reply.id == AMQP_BASIC_GET_EMPTY_METHOD)
    return; /* no messages in the queue to get */

  /* Read the header (1 frame) and the body (1 + x frames) */

  size_t body_remaining;
  amqp_frame_t frame;

  int res = amqp_simple_wait_frame(connection, &frame);
  if (res != 0)
    return; /* failure waiting for frame */
  if (frame.frame_type != AMQP_FRAME_HEADER)
    return; /* expecting AMQP_FRAME_HEADER type of frame */

  /* This memory is valid until you call amqp_maybe_release_buffers() */
  amqp_basic_properties_t *props =
    (amqp_basic_properties_t*)frame.payload.properties.decoded;
  body_remaining = frame.payload.properties.body_size;

  char* body = malloc(body_remaining);
  char* current_body_ptr = body;

  while (body_remaining)
  {
    res = amqp_simple_wait_frame(connection, &frame);
    if (res != 0)
      return; /* failure waiting for frame */
    if (frame.frame_type != AMQP_FRAME_BODY)
      return; /* expecting AMQP_BODY_HEADER */
    memcpy(current_body_ptr, frame.payload.body_fragment.bytes,
frame.payload.body_fragment.len);

    current_body_ptr += frame.payload.body_fragment.len;
    body_remaining -= frame.payload.body_fragment.len;
  }

Can you elaborate on what you mean by this ?making it more difficult to
integrate with other clients? ?The rpc APIs are internal APIs, and
really shouldn't be used by any other applications.

In any case, this sounds like a reasonable improvement. ?Patches
welcome. ?:-)

By Qt I assume you're using C++.

You'll want to look into the rabbitmq-c (
https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c ) client as a c++ wrapper around that
SimpleAmqpClient (https://github.com/alanxz/SimpleAmqpClient )

What, so that they look like a QIODevice and produce QNetworkReply or some such? I don't think that's likely to prove particularly productive. In fact, I'd suggest using the threading support (QRunnable and a thread pool if you need many producers or consumers perhaps) and interacting with the rabbitmq-c client (or C++ wrapper) from here. Trying to make AMQP look like the QT network subsystem API (or vice versa) sounds like a route to loosing hair, or sleep, or both.

Hi: 
I am new in the work with Rabbitmq. I use the program in java of the second tutorial but I did not declare the queue as durable, that is: 
channel.queueDeclare("hello", false, false, false, null); 

The Producer can know if there is a Consumer connected to the queue before sending the message? 

thanks in advance. 
Yuri.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Using Disruptor in web app
Message-ID: <e0756007-d5cd-43a7-9935-8bd2290fc6a5@fr28g2000vbb.googlegroups.com>

Hi all,

Firstly this is awesome stuff and I want to use it in my next project,
which we be run in a web server.  I'm a little worried about trying to
architect my project for performance based around using the disruptor
and getting worse performance than normal due to not understanding it
well enough.  I would really appreciate some input.

The project will be hosted so I won't be able to simplify by having
all data in memory (I think).  It will be a fairy traditional (boring)
project, order entry processing (and other stuff).  So some screens to
view orders, products query for them edit/maintain CRUD type stuff.
So latency isn't important in itself but only as a means to support
the maximum number of users for a smallish server with between 1.7 -17
Gb of memory.

1) Is the disruptor for me?  (I hope yes)
2) When designing the ringbuffer events, how concerned should I be
that they don't change in terms of memory location as they are
mutated.  For instance if I use strings in the event than these will
be re-allocated on each mutation.  Should I use say StringBuilders or
even something like protobuf messages and have the event type as a
byte array and marshall each event into that byte array  (handling for
overflow) I see this as trading memory striding against cpu overhead
and short lived object creation (new strings etc) in the marshalling/
demarshalling process?
3) Since each event will be marshalled from an http request I'm not
sure how large to make the event.  Should it be large so that the ring
buffer has fewer slots but the chance of an oversize object (won't fit
in preallocated event slot) is very small?
4) Should I have just one input ringbuffer with an event definition
that can handle any event (http request) or multiple input ring
buffers?  I think that LMAX had just one.
5) What should the overall process flow be?  an http request will come
in and my web container thread will quickly marshall it into an event
and put in on the ring buffer.  Consumers will read it it and say
fetch a customer from the DB and update the event.  Finally my
business processor (final single threaded beast of a consumer) will
produce an http response.  What's the best/standard way of
communicating that back the original thread that orginated the
request?  via a Latch that's put onto the event?

6) Lastly is there a standard pattern / best practice architecture to
be adopted for a CRUD like web app running in a webserver using the
Disruptor.  I feel like what I'm doing is so standard that the ought
to be a right way to do it.  I'm thinking right now that I would only
need one RingBuffer being fed by the webserver request threads and
then various consumers decorating that,  or do I need another one on
the output side that the business processor is the producer to?

Hope I'm not being dense, really appreciate any advice you can give on
any of the points I've raised.

I agree. Removing or purging should succeed regardless of whether the
broker is stopped or running. You should be able to start the broker
first as a workaround while we solve the problem.

To answer your question literally: yes, use the mgmt HTTP API.

To answer your question slightly less literally, the point of a 
messaging system is to let producers and consumers become decoupled - 
why do you want the producer to know if there is a consumer around?

This doesn't appear to be a very RabbitMQ-related question. Did you want

Well, the code is fine. And RabbitMQ should not just claim to accept 
messages that never go anywhere, regardless of config or permissions. So 
a couple of possibilities spring to mind:

1) Is your publisher talking to the broker you think it is? Or are you 
accidentally sending messages to some other broker? (Stop the broker - 
publishing should fail - does it?)

2) Is there an extra consumer running somewhere that is grabbing the 
messages before your consumer does? (Check rabbitmqctl list_consumers / 
mgmt)

If things *still* don't make sense, the tracing plugin will let you see 
what messages are being published / consumed at the broker.

Cheers, Simon

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ: Simple Test Program has Possible
 Network Issues
Message-ID: <33992826.post@talk.nabble.com>


I have a simple RabbitMQ test program that sends and then receives a message
to a RabbitMQ server. I have two computers and I've found that whether or
not my code works depends on which computer hosts the RabbitMQ server. Here
is my situation (excuse my MS Paint):

http://old.nabble.com/file/p33992826/ServerConfig.png 

1) If computer A hosts the server and runs the code, sending a message from
A to A, it works.
2) If computer A hosts the server and my code runs on computer B, sending a
message from B to A, it works.
3) If computer B hosts the server and my code runs on computer A, sending a
message from A to B, I get an exception that says "None of the specified
endpoints were reachable".
4) If computer B hosts the server and runs the code, sending a message from
B to B, it works.
I can't figure out why scenario #3 doesn't work for me.

* I don't think it's the code because three of my scenarios work exactly as
I expect them to.
* I don't think it's a firewall issue because I ran these tests with my
firewalls turned off on both computers.
* I don't think it's a problem with the RabbitMQ server on computer B
because it is able to communicate with itself just fine (scenario #4).
* I checked the RabbitMQ log files on computer B after trying scenario #3,
but I don't see anything that says something about an attempted connection.
I think computer A is simply unable to see computer B when sending requests.

My question, very generally is, what are some things that I should be
looking for that might point to my problem? There must be some setting that
is checked on computer A but is not checked on computer B. Computer B has
the default installation of Erlang and RabbitMQ. I'm pretty sure computer A
is also set to the defaults (I didn't install it as recently).

Please help.

	simple messages
Message-ID: <3fb1f223-2f86-4862-a842-1ec66998dd9d@googlegroups.com>

  Hello,

  I have installed RabbitMQ 2.8.2 using the RPM file in a Red Hat linux 
server.

  When I try to execute the simple 'Hello World' from ther tutorial (
http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html) I am not able 
to receive the messages I send. When I list the connections using 
rabbitmqctl list_connection I see:

[root at muvmp235 bin]# rabbitmqctl list_connections
Listing connections ...
guest   127.0.0.1       51368   blocking
guest   127.0.0.1       51367   blocked
...done.

  It seems that the receiver is blocking and the other messages are blocked 
because of this. I found that this could be a problem with epdm port, so I 
changed my node name in rabbitmq-env.conf (NODENAME=rabbit at localhost), but 
it doesn't seem to work.

  I have no more clues about how to get this work, and the RabbitMQ 
documentation don't have any info about this. Anyone can help me? Is there 
something I can check or do to make this work?

  Thank you!

  Renne Rocha

This really does sound like a firewall issue to me - remember that there 
may be other firewalls than the ones installed on the machines A and B.

On computer A, what does "telnet <computer B> 5672" look like?

Either the memory alarm or the disk space alarm will have gone off, 
preventing RMQ from accepting new messages. Check the logs.

AMQP transactions are channel-bound, so what you want above is not 
possible. Furthermore, AMQP transactions are only guaranteed to be 
atomic when they involve a single queue. See 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/semantics.html#tx for more details.

Generally you'll want to design your system s.t. it can cope with 
duplicate messages. There are many more failure scenarios than the one 
described above, and re-sending of messages, with the resulting 
possibility of duplication, is usually the easiest way to handle them. 
E.g. consider what happens in case of failures in steps 1 or 3; the 
sender has no way of knowing whether the message made it through and 
hence would have to re-send it.

Hi Matthias,

I agree that the solution is to control the duplication of messages. The
worst case is that I say when messages are notifications to users when an
error has occurred while processing the message queue. The user receive
several messages in the same error. It would be nice in future have
transactions between queues. Something that implement the database systems
quite well. We would greatly facilitate the work.

Thank you very much for the answer

I'm afraid there is no "proper" way. When it works - great. But on
network errors, I'd assume the state of the channel is undefined.
I would be surprised if there is a sane way to recover. Best solution
IMO is to kill the channel and establish a new one.

Much better lifetime management is achieved when underlying
transport is connection - like. With this in mind we created
web-stomp plugin, you might give it a try:

Hi Marek, thank you for your answer.

In case when we are closing channel, it sends close channel request to server and fails too.
Regarding web-stomp - we can't use it because it requires WebSocket support and we need to communicate with RabbitMQ from any browser.

You can also check to see if a queue exists by doing a passive declare.
Since your queue is non-durable, if there are no consumers connected to it,
it won't exist.

To answer Simon's question, I do this in order to route requests to a
specific machine/consumer cluster by declaring a queue with the name of the
machine which is consuming. I check to see if the queue exists first, and
if it does, I route the message to that queue (where there may be multiple
consumers on it), otherwise I send it to a general queue which is durable.
Essentially I'm using it to partition tasks based on their hardware/network
needs.

Cheers,
-Alex

I don't think it's actually so bad in principle, though the implementation
isn't there yet.

The channel object on the server side has a timeout - if there's a waiting
longpoll, the timer isn't counting down, but during periods when the object
is untouched the timer is ticking. The timer is reset to its starting value
whenever the object receives a method call. Eventually, if left alone, the
channel's timer expires and the channel is closed.

So, if you can arrange for the JS to just attempt reconnection over and
over up to the point where the timer must have expired, you can rejoin your
channel state. (It works this way because of the spotty nature of XHR
"connections" in the best case.) You can control the expiry timer length on
the channel object - pass the channelTimeout option (in *seconds*) to the
RabbitMQ.Channel constructor from rabbitmq.js.

If the channel timer has expired, and you try to touch the old channel
object, you'll get an error from the server (because the server doesn't
know what object you mean anymore). In that case, yes, all the channel
state is gone and you need to take extra steps like creating a fresh
channel to work with.

I'm not certain, but it might be the case that a few small (but
carefully-thought-out) changes to rabbitmq.js could make it sanely and
transparently attempt reconnection.

The docs here are telling you that is the client responsibility to
detect offline nodes and connect to other nodes in the cluster; not
that the AMQP client code will do that for you automatically. In this
case you will need to manually connect to ALLEGRO or ORION when RIYAZ
is down.

You could perhaps employ an alternate exchange

accomplish this more elegantly.

  It seems odd to have disk space or memory problems, since I am trying to
use a very simple example :-) But looking at the logs I saw this:

  =INFO REPORT==== 11-Jun-2012::19:18:01 ===
Disk free space limit now exceeded. Free bytes:2127663104 Limit:16726757376

=INFO REPORT==== 11-Jun-2012::19:18:01 ===
    alarm_handler: {set,{{resource_limit,disk,zinanode at muvmp235},[]}}

  It seems to be a disk space problem.

  Reading the docs (http://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#diskfreesup) I
found that the default value is 1.0 times the amount of total RAM is
required to be free on the Mnesia partition. But how do I know what is the
suitable value to be set? Is there any rule? Or should I try-and-error
until my system works fine?

  Best regards,

  Renne Rocha

Cheers, Simon

Rabbit doesn't know that ;) and thus has to assume the worst, namely 
that you are about to bombard it with a vast volume of message.

Well, 1.0xRAM is a suitable value, which is why it's the default ;)

You have 16GB of memory but just 2GB of free disk space. If you really 
must get rabbit working in such a constrained environment, then set the 
limit to a very low number. But be advised that any use of persistent 
messages or paging is going to exhaust disk space pretty quickly and may 
result in rabbit crashing.

Regards,

Matthias.

Yeah, that does look a bit better than doing a passive declare before every
send. I'll give that a shot and see what happens.

Thanks Matthias!

  It works perfectly with a disk_free_limit lower than 2Gb as
expected. So the problem really is the disk space. Thank you for the
help!

? And no! I don't have to get RabbitMQ working in such a constrained
environment.

  I realized that the default partition on what the mnesia database
files was stored have insufficient disk space. To solve that, I set
the environment variable RABBITMQ_MNESIA_BASE
(http://www.rabbitmq.com/relocate.html) to a partition that have
enough space. Now it is working!

  Thank you!

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ logging to rsyslog instead of text
	files?
Message-ID: <CACLE7izPMaM-hCkgSetZJfn80eVM6Umf8qaQ1wLSQ-fScPxovg@mail.gmail.com>

In our environment (lots of service processes on hundreds of machine,
all on Ubuntu), we do a pretty through job of sending all the various
diagnostics spew through rsyslog to a single server where we can see
everything in a roughly chronological time order.

RabbitMQ is the one holdout to this. It seems to want to always write
its output to files under /var/log on the local machine (e.g.,
rabbit at play.log). Are there any settings or tricks that enable the
RabbitMQ output to easily be redirected to rsyslog? I've seen mention
of imfile, but that seems heavy handed at the moment. Is the only real
option?

Thanks,

Matt

Hi Mikhail,
I think you'll need to provide a little more information.
As far as I understand it, Qt is a GUI library, and not a language itself.

So, the library you'll need for RabbitMQ will depend on which language 
you are using.

Did any of the troubleshooting tips help?
 http://www.rabbitmq.com/troubleshooting.html

What do /var/log/rabbitmq/startup_err and _log say?

What happens when you try to start the broker
 invoke-rc.d rabbitmq-server start

I'm not able to reproduce this error on the enterprise edition with SP2.
At which stage during the installation exactly do you receive this error
- is it during the installation of Erlang or RabbitMQ? Which version?
Can you quote any preceding messages that appeared on the screen? Is
there anything relevant in the event log?

You might be able to hook up the amq.rabbitmq.log exchange to Tony's UDP 
exchange https://github.com/tonyg/udp-exchange and the syslog packet format?

Other than that, yes it would be nice to have better control over 
logging :-)

Indeed, it's a C++ library, but it has wrappers in a whole bunch of different languages. So you should be able to use whatever library is appropriate for the language you're working in.

Python would be a good one, if language doesn't matter to you.

James,

Sorry to be so tardy. Are you still having problems?

The gist code you put up (I only ran the native version on my local
machine) works fine for me

(after I modified the publish to write to routing key "test" instead of
"flibble" -- flibble isn't in the demo_send code, so this must be a
misprint?)

and I can send (and see in rabbitmqctl list_queues) many messages to
queue "test" using the default exchange.

This is typical output:

Web-Stomp uses SockJS underneath which does not require native websockets.

You can use web-stomp from any browser newer than IE6.

Interesting! Thanks Simon.

Also, someone internal to our company subsequently suggested using
logger(1) and possibly mkfifo.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Help with the SSL tutorial on Windows Server 2008
Message-ID: <261B7FE1ECF3ED4C997D432F8018855E0117BEACEE@DEFTHW99E85MSX.ww902.siemens.net>

Hello,

I recently installed RabbitMQ and successfully ran some of the tutorials using the .NET client. So far so good. Now I want to enable SSL encryption, but I am having problems following the tutorial.

Server is Windows Server 2008, 64 Bit.
My client is Windows 7 (64 Bit), but in the deployment scenario will be Windows Server 2008, 64 Bit.

What I did so far:

-          Installed otp_win64_R15B01.exe

-          Installed rabbitmq-server-2.8.2.exe

-          Added the rabbitmq.config file to the appdata/RabbitMQ directory with the content as shown in the tutorial (did not change the certificates yet)

When I start the service, the log shows
=INFO REPORT==== 12-Jun-2012::17:26:18 ===
started SSL Listener on [::]:5671

=INFO REPORT==== 12-Jun-2012::17:26:18 ===
started SSL Listener on 0.0.0.0:5671

Now I would like to create my own Certificate Authority and create certificates. The example in the tutorial seems to be using UNIX and does not show where to expect certain executables (e.g. openssl). I cannot find the file when I am searching for it on my server. Also certain UNIX commands are not available in Windows and I am not sure if they are required under windows or what the equivalent is (chmod, touch).

Could somebody please shed some light on what is missing? Do I need to install anything else? The tutorial is mentioning certain extra steps for Erlang R13B, but I am using R15B so I can ignore these steps?

Thanks for any help,
Wolfgang

Hi Emile,

My Windows is Windows Server 2003 R2 Enterprise x64 SP2, the problem
happens when I install RabbitMQ version 2.8.2 (with Erlang
otp_win64_R15B01). In attachment has a printscreen.

The problem happens too when I try execute rabbitmqctl.bat -status (the
dump in attachment)

Thanks,

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Clustered startup with multiple queues and
	multiple masters
Message-ID: <CACLE7iyH83gE=HG=iFFVN-LDWV2F1chh98AS-iA=BFzjNEEMUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Looking for some clarification here.

As I understand from other messages on this forum, in a clustered
setup, the last node shut down should be the first node set up. Again
(in my possibly incorrect assumption), this is because Rabbit and/or
Mnesia may wait for what they believe to be the previous master to
come up first. By starting up the "master" first, any blocking/waiting
can be avoided. In addition, message loss can be avoided by preventing
a prior out-of-sync slave from becoming the master.

Now, consider a situation like this, where there are N queues that are
mastered on different brokers (e.g, rabbit at play, rabbit at play2). If we
pulled the power cord on all these machines, what should the node
startup order be?

real_cm rabbit at play +2  HA D Active 0 0 0
aliveness-test rabbit at play  Active 0 0 0
carbon rabbit at play +2  HA D Idle 0 0 0
cmcmd rabbit at play +2  HA D Idle 0 0 0
fake_cm rabbit at play2 +2  HA D Idle 0 0 0
fake_mu_queue rabbit at play2 +2  HA D Idle 0 0 0
fake_service_2 rabbit at play +2  HA D Idle 0 0 0
random rabbit at play +2  HA D Idle

And at the risk of asking a broader question, what is the recommended
approach to restarting from a catastrophic power failure where all
nodes go down within a very short period of time?

In our experiments with RabbitMQ 2.82, Ubuntu 10.04 and Erlang R13B03,
it's a total crap shoot whether the cluster comes back up or hangs
with all nodes stuck at the "starting database...." point.

Thanks,

Matt

Message-ID: <CAJinw2qAd3Po23uNzogngsiBiQuySqJ+jOuag=g=h7-=jUw08w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We are using rabbitmq 2.7.1 server and java client jars. We ran into an
issue where one of our client applications got into a connect/disconnect
loop and filled the rabbitmq server logs with Connect/disconnect messages
sort of like this.

=INFO REPORT==== 30-May-2012::00:00:03 ===
closing TCP connection <0.1769.9> from 172.27.9.135:42440

=INFO REPORT==== 30-May-2012::00:00:03 ===
accepted TCP connection on [::]:5672 from 172.27.9.135:42441

=INFO REPORT==== 30-May-2012::00:00:03 ===
starting TCP connection <0.1785.9> from 172.27.9.135:42441

We are still troubleshooting the root cause for the connect/disconnect
loop. In parallel we want to prevent info messages from flooding Rabbitmq
logs.

I tried setting the log level to the error in rabbitmq.config file as show
below, but the change is not taking effect.

[

   {rabbit, [{log_levels,[{connection, error}]}]}

].

 Could you please let me know if there is any missing step?

Thanks,
Nithya

Message-ID: <CAAEFr-cxSu=aChf+W8OruD4gbQputV1vKb1uoOO+jWo-kAUt4g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

My very first message in the list. I am looking to use RabbitMQ for
messaging in our framework. So here are little details of what i am trying
to think of doing with RabbitMQ:

20 producers ( servers ) sending load statistics ( 25 messages per second.
Can be configured to be 25 per n seconds. But we want 'n' to be as low as
possible ) to RabbitMQ message exchange. 2 consumers consuming these
messages to generate real time load statistics of our our servers. So that
these load statistics can then be consumed by load balancing logic.

Load statistics messages will be kind of serialized associative arrays (
less than 200 bytes payload). And each consumer will be multithreaded
process that will just update an in memory datastructure with these values.

For my this scenario i am looking to use a message exchange. I am wondering
if RabbitMQ is a good option to use here. Would i be able to achieve a
system with fairly balanced queue size ?

Thanks

That feature was introduced in 2.8.0. I suggest you upgrade the server.

This does look like a network/firewall problem then.

Did you start the receiver before the sender? If not then the sent 
message will be lost.

You may want to use a queue destination instead. And you should probably 
read http://www.rabbitmq.com/stomp.html#d to gain a broader 
understanding of the various kinds of destinations and their semantics.

Satyarth,

If I understand your case correctly you seek to implement this
pattern:  http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python.html
I.e. you want to distribute your messages across two consumers,
equally.

Is that correct?  If not then you can see other patterns on the pages
linked to above.  For example you may want both consumers to process
all messages.  If so then this pattern may be what you need:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-three-python.html

You mention 'balanced queue size'.  In the first pattern above, you
have one queue and it grows and contracts in length, depending on how
many messages are in it.  If your queue gets too big then consume more
messages ...   And in the second pattern, you could have two queues
both with the same messages in them, which is also 'balanced'.

I hope this helps,

alexis

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Help with the SSL tutorial on Windows Server 2008

Hello,

I recently installed RabbitMQ and successfully ran some of the tutorials using the .NET client. So far so good. Now I want to enable SSL encryption, but I am having problems following the tutorial.

Server is Windows Server 2008, 64 Bit.
My client is Windows 7 (64 Bit), but in the deployment scenario will be Windows Server 2008, 64 Bit.

What I did so far:

-          Installed otp_win64_R15B01.exe

-          Installed rabbitmq-server-2.8.2.exe

-          Added the rabbitmq.config file to the appdata/RabbitMQ directory with the content as shown in the tutorial (did not change the certificates yet)

When I start the service, the log shows
=INFO REPORT==== 12-Jun-2012::17:26:18 ===
started SSL Listener on [::]:5671

=INFO REPORT==== 12-Jun-2012::17:26:18 ===
started SSL Listener on 0.0.0.0:5671

Now I would like to create my own Certificate Authority and create certificates. The example in the tutorial seems to be using UNIX and does not show where to expect certain executables (e.g. openssl). I cannot find the file when I am searching for it on my server. Also certain UNIX commands are not available in Windows and I am not sure if they are required under windows or what the equivalent is (chmod, touch).

Could somebody please shed some light on what is missing? Do I need to install anything else? The tutorial is mentioning certain extra steps for Erlang R13B, but I am using R15B so I can ignore these steps?

Thanks for any help,
Wolfgang

for the relation of consumer and subscriber, I think one connection can 
have one consumer, and one channel can have one subscriber.
Since there can be many channels opened in a connection, so does that 
mean there are many subscribers exist in the same consumer?

If you wish to follow the steps verbatim on Windows then install Cygwin.
The examples assume that you have the OpenSSL binaries and utilities on
your PATH. You can do the same on WINDOWS.

You don't have to use OpenSSL. If you have your own PKI then feel free
to use that. You will need to refer to the documentation of your PKI
provider and ensure that certificates and keys are in the correct format.

If you choose to use OpenSSL for creating and signing certificates then
you will need to install it first. See
http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html

On average later versions of Erlang have fewer SSL bugs than earlier
versions. Using R15B (or later) should be fine.

Hi Bill. When you do not want to loose messages then RabbitMQ has 
support for ensuring that messages are on-disk and that the producer 
knows this for sure. When rabbit is set up this way, no message will be 
lost and we would consider it a serious bug if any were (and would fix 
the problem as soon as humanly possible!) - so I think having the right 
set up for this should probably be your first port of call.

The first step is to declare your queue as durable, ensuring it will 
survive a broker crash. Secondly, you should indicate that your messages 
are persistent, instructing the broker to put them on disk so they too 
will survive any crash.

The next step is to set up producer confirms on the channel you're 
publishing to. The broker confirms it has taken responsibility for these 
messages by sending a basic.ack on the same channel. Persistent messages 
are confirmed when all queues have either delivered the message and 
received an acknowledgement, or persisted the message (which includes 
flushing the data to disk). It is important to make sure your consumers 
have to ack messages to ensure no information can potentially be lost in 
transit.

As per the documentation on publisher confirms (see 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#confirms), the broker will send 
a basic.nack if it cannot, for some reason handle the message. The 
publisher can then decide what to do.

When you now set up your cluster, you can use HA (active/active mirror) 
queues to make sure that each node in the cluster behaves in this way 
with regard to handling messages. If the master node crashes, any 
message that has been ack'ed is going to be safely persisted on a mirror 
queue on one of the neighboring nodes.

To my mind, this comes down entirely to how you process messages in the 
consumer. If a persistent message is written to a durable queue, the 
channel is set up to use publisher confirms, and the message has been 
ack'ed by the broker it is *definitely* not lost: it is on disk at this 
point.

In AMQP-0.9.1 the issue of whether or not a job has been processed (by a 
consumer) already is entirely dependent on the client. You can set up a 
system for tracking jobs by unique id (uuid, or whatever) in the 
consumer, to ensure that a job isn't processed twice. You should 
probably read 
http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2010-August/008271.html 
to get a feel for why this requires explicit effort by the consumers.

Well I'd like to know where your concerns about loss of messages comes 
from. As with anything built by humans, there is always *some* risk of 
things going wrong with any software, but rabbit does a *lot* of work to 
make sure this doesn't ever happen. If you're using publisher confirms 
and clustering (which latter technique choosing the Consistency and 
Availability parts of the CAP theorem), then you should not have to 
worry about this too much, especially in a 'work-queue' scenario, which 
this sounds like.

Well rabbit fight's like a cornered... rabbit ... to make sure this 
doesn't happen! ;)

Please feel free to elaborate on your concerns and questions, as that's 
what the list is for! I'd certainly like to understand a bit more about 
how your application works, what constitutes a job and how these are 
identified throughout the system. I often find the issue of identity can 
be particularly vexing in any non-trivial architecture.

The terms consumer and subscriber are often used interchangeably - they
refer to the same thing. You can have many channels per connection, and
many consumers per channel.

That's correct, this is because mnesia wants to make sure that the
node with the most up-to-date dataset starts up first, so that we
avoid diverging tables.

If you shut down the nodes abruptly, rabbit won't complain when
starting the nodes because in whatever order because it won't know
about the running nodes at the time of shutdown (which are recorded in
a file in the shutdown sequence). In other words, it's up to you to
restart them so that the node with the most up-to-date mnesia is
started first (what will happen if mnesia thinks that we're not the
most up to date one is mnesia will hang waiting for the table copies
in the other nodes, which are offline).

I would say that the safest thing to do here is:

  1) Start one disc node. If it hangs waiting for the table, try the
     next one until one works. If none works, things are ugly, and
     I can think of ways of fixing them manually but that's more
     complicated (and dangerous)
  2) Start another node without starting rabbit (you can do
     that setting the RABBITMQ_NODE_ONLY env variable)
  3) Reset it, force_cluster it to the disc node you brought up,
     and then reset it again. This will make the disc node believe that
     the original node has left the cluster.
  4) Once you have done this for each node, you will be left with only
     one node which is not in a cluster, and you can cluster your nodes
     back to that one.

This is pretty ugly but it's the only safe way in all situations, due
to the possibility of the nodes performing upgrades. If you're sure
that the nodes won't need to upgrade (e.g. same version of rabbit and
erlang) you can perform step 1 and then just start the other nodes
normally later, and it should be OK. Someone else in the team might
have a better idea, but I don't :).

By the way, we're working hard on making this process and in general
clustering simpler and safer, so in the future things should be
better.

RabbitMQ is installed as a windows service using the default settings. I 
can manage it through the web admin console, but can't connect to it 
through the command line. If I type "rabbitmqctl status", I will get this 
message:

Thanks Emile and Michael for you help. I installed OpenSSL (the 32 Bit version on the 64 Bit Windows as stated in the tutorial). I successfully generated the certificates according to the tutorial. But now I am running into a problem when starting the RabbitMQ Service. It terminates right away without any specific error. In the event viewer "System" log, I get the following error:

--------
RabbitMQ: Erlang machine stopped instantly (distribution name conflict?). The service is not restarted as OnFail is set to ignore.
--------

My config file looks like this (the paths are correct):
[
  {rabbit, [
     {ssl_listeners, [5671]},
     {ssl_options, [{cacertfile,C:/Messaging/testca/cacert.pem},
                    {certfile,C:/Messaging/server/cert.pem},
                    {keyfile,C:/Messaging/server/key.pem},
                    {verify,verify_peer},
                    {fail_if_no_peer_cert,false}]}
   ]}
].

I cannot find any more details on this error. The log file is empty. Any idea what might cause this? Are the generated certificates incorrect? Surprisingly, the service starts fine if I replace the values with invalid dummy entries.

If you wish to follow the steps verbatim on Windows then install Cygwin.
The examples assume that you have the OpenSSL binaries and utilities on your PATH. You can do the same on WINDOWS.

You don't have to use OpenSSL. If you have your own PKI then feel free to use that. You will need to refer to the documentation of your PKI provider and ensure that certificates and keys are in the correct format.

If you choose to use OpenSSL for creating and signing certificates then you will need to install it first. See http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html

On average later versions of Erlang have fewer SSL bugs than earlier versions. Using R15B (or later) should be fine.

According to the troubleshooting guide you need to check the
.erlang.cookie - see t

http://www.rabbitmq.com/troubleshooting.html
and

You need to add quotes around the paths.

Hi,

What do you mean by "splitting cluster"? I'd interpret it as "the
connection was severed between the two nodes", but maybe it's
something different, considering that you're having problems
*starting* nodes. In any case, clustering in rabbit does not tolerate
partitions well. The most it can take is simply nodes going down and
then up again, but if the data in the tables diverge, things will go
wrong.

In your case, since you're getting a timeout in the database boot
step, I'd guess that for some reason mnesia thinks that it has to wait
the tables in the other nodes first. This typically happen when
trying to start a node of an offline cluster before starting the last
node to go down (mnesia wants the last node to go down first because
it has the most up-to-date data). Normally rabbit will terminate with
a friendlier error message ("please start up the last node to go down"
or similar) but if you shut down the nodes abruptly this won't happen
and you'll get an hanging node.

If what I described above matches your situation, then you can refer
to this other post I just sent regarding those situations:
http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2012-June/020594.html
. If it doesn't, can you describe in more detail what you are doing to
get that? The logs would help too.

Francesco.

Uhm, when answering the question I had completely overlooked the fact
that you have HA queues in place that are not shared accross the
entire cluster.

In that case, I'd make sure that you are not performing upgrades
(which roughly translates in not changing your configuration) and then
find a node that work as described in step 1 and let the others catch
up, which *should* be fine.

That post advocates reseting the cluster nodes to restore a "clean"
cluster. That obviously means that you'll lose any data that resides
on that node only, for example non-HA queues. So if don't want that,
you should only follow step 1 and then start the other nodes, while
making sure that the rabbit/erlang version stays the same.

Hi,

Are you compiling RMQ from scratch? I noticed that there was an
error in our code, it should be fixed now:
    http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-web-stomp/rev/00f77bfac6a1

There were few minor problems with your code (like the form submission).
I modified it a bit and got it working, the code is here:

https://gist.github.com/2923514

Hope that helps,
Marek

This is not necessary, a reset here should be enough, without having
to re-cluster it. Sorry about the confusion.

Emile,

Thank you for feedback,

About the problem with Erlang, you are right, the commands that you sent to
me are sufficient to cause the problem, want  you  report the problem to
Erlang Team? (you seem know more than me about the problem =) ).

I will try use Erlang 32 bits version and before I will send the results
(You think I will have problems using this version and about colateral
effects, what do you think?)

Thank you so much,

Att.,

Thiago Burgo

Emile,

With Erlang 32 bits version, RabbitMQ worked properly. We will wait for
Erlang correction to test with x64 version.

Thank you,

Thanks for confirming. I'll forward the bug report on to the Erlang

Message-ID: <BCC407A444557E41B0D8B0260D68499205022BC7@CA1EXCLV07.adcorp.kla-tencor.com>

Hi All,

 

We are running several RabbitMQ servers on Windows. The version is
2.7.1.

The servers have been running for several months. The log files are over
16 GB now.

We tried to rotate the log manually with rabbitmqctl.bat.

 

For some reason, only -sasl log file was rotated. The very large main
log file was not.

If you know some way to solve this problem without shutting down the
server, please let me know.

 

Thank you in advance,

 

Best regards,

--Bin Chen

Hi Alexis,

Thanks for reply. My use case falls on category 2 ( two consumers
processing each messages ). However i think i did not communicate my
question about balanced queue size well. What i meant is : If message are
received at the rate of 450 msgs/sec ( 25 messages per second from 20
servers, each message of around 200 bytes ) by the broker/exchange , am i
touching the performance limits of the system ? My actual consumer
processing will be light weight ( parse message and store values in
in-memory key-value store ).

What will be approximate latency introduced by RabbitMQ ( Broker/Queuing )
in this case ? I did check the performance benchmarks they are very helpful
and did get some idea on what latency to expect. But if someone can think
of to add on to that, i will appreciate very much.


Thanks

I think you'll be ok.  See:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2012/04/25/rabbitmq-performance-measurements-part-2/

Latency will be client-dependent but the broker should not add more
than 1ms at this (transient) load.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Hostname issue. Possible to rename the database?
Message-ID: <4FD93413.2060502@numenet.com>

Unfortunately, I am just now seeing this --

An EC2 server running RabbitMQ (2.2.0)  was rebooted and received a new 
hostname, and the new database is empty.

I have succeeded in getting access to the database by setting the 
RABBITMQ_NODENAME var to the old hostname.

Is there some way of renaming it though, so I can retain the old 
database and its configuration, while still implementing the hosts 
changes described above?
I tried renaming the directories, but that didn't work.

Or, perhaps, copy it to the new more persistent hostname?  I'd rather 
not have to go through the setup again.

Thanks in advance,
Liam

Hi,
Are you compiling RMQ from scratch? I noticed that there was an
error in our code, it should be fixed now:
    http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-web-stomp/rev/00f77bfac6a1
There were few minor problems with your code (like the form submission).
I modified it a bit and got it working, the code is here:
https://gist.github.com/2923514
Hope that helps,

Message-ID: <E0353888-25B4-440A-B8E7-743C14FCE872@cyberagent.co.jp>

Hi,

I have a similar problem as Goel. I installed RabbitMQ using the official RPM package from rabbitmq.com on CentOS 6.2. Connecting to the broker works fine, sending messages gives no error, but it just never arrives at the receiver. If I install the older RabbitMQ package from EPEL (2.6.1), everything works just fine.

Here's how to reproduce it:
1) Get a fresh CentOS 6.2 box.
2) yum install http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-server/v2.8.2/rabbitmq-server-2.8.2-1.noarch.rpm
3) service rabbitmq-server start
4) Create send.py and receive.py according to the "Hello World" tutorial at http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html
5) Run receive.py
6) Run send.py

No message arrives at receive.py, but send.py gives no error. The log just shows "accepting AMQP connection <0.450.0> (127.0.0.1:39162 -> 127.0.0.1:5672)" messages). Using "rabbitmqctl", I can see several status details of the server and I compared them to the "should look like this" output on the Troubleshooting page. I could not see any error.

7) service rabbitmq-server stop
8) yum erase rabbitmq-server
9) rm -rf /var/lib/rabbitmq
10) yum clean all
11) yum install rabbitmq-server (this time from EPEL)
12) Run receive.py
13) Run send.py

Now it works.

Any idea what may cause this?

Sorry, you can't rename the data on disk - it's an Erlang issue rather
than a RabbitMQ issue and there's no work around, sorry.

Also, 2.2.0 is at least one year old and possibly more like two. You
really should upgrade if you can - not that it would solve this issue
mind you.

I've observed that the broker consumes RAM according to the size of the
logfile during rotation, so it seems likely that the logfile is read
into memory in its entirety. I will file a bug to reduce the memory
requirements during log rotation, but in the meantime you will need to
rotate logs often enough that they fit in available RAM.

It might be possible by turning logging off and back on using the
underlying error_logger
(http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/error_logger.html) and the "rabbitmqctl
eval" command, but this is unsupported and you risk losing messages
generated during the procedure. I recommend instead that you shut down
the broker.

I'm afraid not. It can talk to AD, but you still need to supply credentials.

RabbitMQ 2.8.2 and the plugins as described in the blog post [1] should
work together just fine. No need to reinstall.

But if you're running 2.8.2 you should not have any issues. Which is weird.
Have you tried running examples from the gist [2] ? Did they work?

Also, have you spotted anything unusual in RabbitMQ logs?
The location is described in our docs [3].

Message-ID: <CAAqmy6PGBaRgvzUheUEtQc6MLtufKnoMQjszMkEHmjcshQXNYQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using the .NET client library and my consumer has a Subscription with
NoAck set to false so my consumer can Ack messages when it has successfully
handled them.  When I receive a BasicDeliverEventArgs and want to basic
nack it because my consumer couldn't handle the message, am I supposed to
be calling this:

subscription.Model.BasicNack (m.DeliveryTag, false, true);

where delivery is the BasicDeliverEventArgs that I got from the
subscription?  It's not very clear from the API reference or user guide how
you would reject a message from a subscription.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <1B0DB90F-08B5-4C71-BC90-D1571CDCC50D@jefftrout.com>

we're on 2.7.2 and things are (normally) great.

However once in a while (every week or two) it seems we lose all connections to rabbit and I'm trying to trace it down. 

Now, it is certainly possible it is NOT rabbit's fault as we run our connections through haproxy (connecting to one of two rabbit instances that are clustered).  However it has turned out tracing what haproxy is doing isn't going well, and our rabbit logs are too noisy to be of use.

that being said - is there any situation where rabbit would drop all connections at once? (thinking further on it, since I'm running connections to 2 rabbit instances through haproxy it would likely have to be haproxy barfing not rabbit.. unless there's something in rabbit that causes it to drop all connections across the cluster).

 cpu in tight epoll_wait loop
Message-ID: <CAKBgs90y326EChRNwtjFzKLQfvbqq0k8=ffG7tcNt9hW487G7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello;

I am running rabbitmq-server 2.8.2 installed from official RPM on a single
CPU RHEL6 64-bit box. Erlang R14B is installed from EPEL 6 repository.
Immediately upon startup, the beam process consumes 100% of the system's 1
CPU and never consumes less.

  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+
COMMAND
 8178 rabbitmq  20   0  725m 148m 2944 R 98.5  3.9   4:11.54 beam

Running strace on the process reveals that beam is in a tight loop, with
the following sequence repeated endlessly:

read(5, "00", 32)                       = 2
read(5, 0x7fffc2213e40, 32)             = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily
unavailable)
epoll_wait(0, {}, 256, 0)               = 0
futex(0x7f93c272f8dc, FUTEX_WAKE_OP_PRIVATE, 1, 1, 0x7f93c272f8d8,
{FUTEX_OP_SET, 0, FUTEX_OP_CMP_GT, 1}) = 1
futex(0x7f93c272f8b0, FUTEX_WAKE_PRIVATE, 1) = 1
futex(0x7f93c272f954, FUTEX_WAKE_OP_PRIVATE, 1, 1, 0x7f93c272f950,
{FUTEX_OP_SET, 0, FUTEX_OP_CMP_GT, 1}) = 1
futex(0x7f93c272f928, FUTEX_WAKE_PRIVATE, 1) = 1
epoll_wait(0, {{EPOLLIN, {u32=5, u64=9332386261106688005}}}, 256, 0) = 1

This occurs even when zero clients are connected to rabbitmq. Do you have
any ideas about this? Is this expected behavior?

	other
Message-ID: <de7e72d4-243b-49dc-a768-4bb1eb15d8bc@googlegroups.com>



I'm working on a RabbitMQ distributed POC and I'm stuck at the basics of 
clustering the nodes.
I'm trying to follow the rabbit's tutorial<http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html> on 
clustering so this is my reference.
After installing erlang (R14B04) and rabbit (2.8.2-1) I've copied the 
.erlang.cookie file contents from one node to the other two.
I wasn't sure about how to get erlang to notice this change to I had to 
restart the machines themselves (pretty brute force but I don't know erlang 
at all).
In addtion I opened in iptables 4369 and 5 additional ports for 
communications and placed under/usr/lib64/erlang/bin/sys.config the 
following config:

{kernel,[{inet_dist_listen_min, XX00},{inet_dist_listen_max,XX05}]}]

Then another restart (dumb I know) to verify erlang takes these into 
consideration but still when I run:

rabbitmqctl cluster rabbit at HostName1

I get:

Clustering node rabbit at HostName2 with [rabbit at HostName1] ...
Error: {no_running_cluster_nodes,[rabbit at HostName1],
                                 [rabbit at HostName1]}

There is a chance my fiddling with the erlang.cookie or with the ports did 
not succeed but I don't know how to check them. I tried typing erl in the 
cmd and then erl_epmd:names() or other commands to get more information but 
I'm probably way off in erlang land.

Would truly appreciate any help

Hi Christopher,

We are trying to setup the HA for RabbitMQ with Corosync. We are able to 
install the corosync but not able to configure with RabbitMQ. We have tried 
to locate but not able to find where to configure. Please can you provide 
some pointers of steps to configure the RabbitMQ configuration files with 
Corosync.

Thanks in advance,
Sateesh B.

Message-ID: <20120617222956.GA28631@wellquite.org>

Over the last few days there's been a lot of disruption to networking
infrastructure at RabbitMQ HQ and vmware generally. This has meant loss
of email services amongst others. Hopefully this is all fixed now, and
indeed this email should be a demonstration of that.

If you have sent an email to us over the last 3 days, my belief is that
it should make its way through to us soon, though my SMTP knowledge is
getting a little rusty these days. If you've not got a response or seen
your post to the list arrive by mid-week, please don't hesitate to get
back in touch with us.

Very sorry for the inconvenience caused. This was a long way beyond our
own control.

When rabbit-server (or rabbit-server.bat) fails to start, you get a non-zero exit status, so you *should* be able to deal with that in your program by trying again or whatever.

Which problem are you asking for help with bino - what to do about restarting rabbit, handling rabbit up/down statuses in the producer script, or dealing with an intermittent 3g connection? If it's the latter, then I'd recommend wrapping your rabbit startup routine with a check to ensure that the 3g connection is up. You'll also need to do something in your producer script to handle rabbit being potentially unavailable sometimes. If the internet connection is intermittent, then you're not going to escape from having to handle this scenario.

Message-ID: <c43d0fd4-fafd-40ed-8306-e14712510749@googlegroups.com>

Hi,

I have seen that the RabbitMQ is using the NoSQL database mnesia for 
storing its messaging queues. Is my assumption is correct. Can I know if we 
can configure the RabbitMQ with MySQL instead of mnesia. If possible, can 
anyone provide the pointers for that configuration.

Thanks in advance,

RabbitMQ 2.8.2 and the plugins as described in the blog post [1] should
work together just fine. No need to reinstall.
But if you're running 2.8.2 you should not have any issues. Which is weird.
Have you tried running examples from the gist [2] ? Did they work?
Also, have you spotted anything unusual in RabbitMQ logs?
The location is described in our docs [3].

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Queue automatically binding to default
	exchange...
Message-ID: <a6f0df4a-813d-4ba4-812c-11afbb20fc2e@googlegroups.com>


Hello,

I'm using rabbitmq with node.js and have a problem when binding queues. 
Every time I bind a queue to a named exchange it automatically seems to 
bind to the 'default' direct exchange as well. Why is it doing this and how 
can I make it stop? Any help would be great thanks...

Here's the code:

var amqp = require('amqp');

var connection = amqp.createConnection({host:'localhost'});

connection.on('ready', function(){
    var q = connection.queue('test_queue_name');
    var exc = connection.exchange('test_exchange', { autoDelete:true });
    q.bind('test_exchange', 'test.key');
});

Here's the console output when using the "rabbitmqctl list_bindings" 
command:

Listing bindings ...
        exchange        test_queue_name queue   test_queue_name []
test_exchange   exchange        test_queue_name queue   test.key        []
...done.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Fanout exchange doesnt publish to all consumers
Message-ID: <c8994c0f-93cd-4749-b9f8-0b0cef30542d@googlegroups.com>

I am using the AMQP pecl extension (http://pecl.php.net/package/amqp) for 
connecting to rabbitMQ from my PHP app. I have the following scripts:

producer.php:

$cnn = new AMQPConnection();
$cnn->connect();

$ch = new AMQPChannel($cnn);

$ex = new AMQPExchange($ch);
$ex->setName('ex2');
$ex->setType(AMQP_EX_TYPE_FANOUT);
$ex->declare();

$q = new AMQPQueue($ch);
$q->setName('test1243');
$q->setFlags(AMQP_DURABLE);
$q->declare();
$q->bind('ex2', 'routing.key');

for ($i = 0; $i < 100; $i++) {
    $ex->publish('msg ' . ($i +1), 'routing.key');
}

The producer publishes 100 messages. 

Then I have a consumer.php:

$cnn = new AMQPConnection();
$cnn->connect();

// Create a channel
$ch = new AMQPChannel($cnn);

$q = new AMQPQueue($ch);
$q->setName('test1243');
$q->setFlags(AMQP_DURABLE);
$q->declare();
$q->bind('ex2', 'routing.key');

$ex = new AMQPExchange($ch);
$ex->setName('ex2');
$ex->setType(AMQP_EX_TYPE_FANOUT);
$ex->declare();

function processMessage($envelope, $queue) {
    echo "Message $i: " . $envelope->getBody() . "\n";
    $queue->ack($envelope->getDeliveryTag());
}

$q->consume("processMessage");

The consumer just writes the messages to stdout and ack?s them. 

I used the exchange type fanout, because I want each message from the 
producer delivered to each consumer. 

But if I start 2 consumers the output looks like this:

output consumer1:
Message : msg 1
Message : msg 3
Message : msg 5
...

output consumer2:
Message : msg 2
Message : msg 4
Message : msg 6
Message : msg 8
...

It looks like the messages are distributed using round robin or the like, 
consumer 1 gets message 1, consumer 2 gets message 2 etc. 

Is fanout the wrong exchange for this? Or is something wrong in my setup 
code?
Defining the routing key is probably usesless as this is ignored in fanout 
anway, right?

I have this same problem, I just installed following the directions on the

I also tried installing from source, and was unsuccessful.  I'm not really 
sure where the problem lies.  

It's kinda bad when the first example in a tutorial doesn't run... :)

This is definitely not expected behaviour. Can you determine what that
file descriptor corresponds to by looking earlier in the output?
What does "etop" output?
How repeatable is the problem?
Have you observed this on any other servers, or is it only one?

Hi Ashutosh,

How did you obtain rabbitmq-public-umbrella, and what command do you 
give to make?

New queues are bound to the default exchange by default, as required by
the AMQP specification. This was intended as a convenience so that you
don't have to create a new exchange and binding in the simplest cases.
You are free to ignore the default exchange - it won't interfere with
what you are doing.

Hi Ashutosh,

That commands simply checks out the repositories below the umbrella. 
What are you doing next, and what is going wrong (i.e., what does the 
output from make look like)?

Cheers,
Tim

In fact, I've automatically parsed 'co' and saw 'checkout' - `make co` 
won't do *anything* as there is no 'co' command or dependency in the 
makefile.

Perhaps you might try `make checkout && make all` instead?

A fanout exchange will route messages to all bound queues, but you only
have one queue. You want something like tutorial 3:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-three-python.html

But your code sets up something that looks like tutorial2:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python.html

If each consumer declares and binds its own queue then you should see
each consumer receiving all messages.

Your question is not that clear. Do you want to run the rabbit
*broker* on android? Or only the client?

Assuming the latter, you probably want to play with the Java client:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/java-client.html .

Also, the first hit on google for "rabbitmq android" leads to this:
http://simonwdixon.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/getting-started-with-rabbitmq-on-android-part-1/
, which is also referenced in the "Clients & Developer Tools" page of
our website: http://www.rabbitmq.com/devtools.html .

What "pdf tutorial" are you referring to?

Francesco.

Simon Dixon wrote an excellent guide about this:
http://simonwdixon.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/getting-started-with-rabbitmq-on-android-part-1/

I suggest you complete a few of the Java tutorials before attempting
something more advanced like Android development:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html

You will need access to a RabbitMQ broker. Setting one up locally should
only take a few minutes. We also host a public demo broker which you are
free to use: amqp://guest:guest at dev.rabbitmq.com/%2F

Are you sure RabbitMQ-Web-Stomp is actually listening on localhost
on this port?

You can verify it by opening your browser at this url:
  http://127.0.0.1:55674/stomp
you should see SockJS hello message.

Hi Ashutosh,

I'm struggling to understand which steps you're having difficulty with. 
Are you having difficulty checking out from mercurial using the umbrella 
build system, or compiling plugins underneath the umberlla, or are you 
having difficulty using Make in general?

If that latter, then our first port of call is to check that you have a 
proper build environment set up (including a working Make tool-chain 
obtained via cygwin, msys or mingw) and Erlang/OTP installed on your 
computer.

I'm also interested in why it is necessary for you to build a plugin in 
order to achieve your goals: what functionality do you need to add to 
RabbitMQ?

Cheers,
Tim

Steve,

Did you look at the responses to Renne's problem?

Renne was running RabbitMQ on a machine with more RAM than available
disk space (16Gb and 2Gb respectively).

This is a highly constrained environment, and if RabbitMQ has to persist
or offload messages it is likely that it will fail very soon.

Read the doc ([1]) for more information about setting the disk free
space limit, and check your logs to see if this is indicated.

If this doesn't seem relevant to your symptoms, then a little more
information would be needed before we can help to solve your
problem.

Actually RabbitMQ uses a bespoke log-structured message store. Mnesia is
mostly used to store resource details, such as queues, exchanges and
accounts.

You should look at this blog post by Matthew Sackman before attempting
to use a database as a backing store:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2011/01/20/rabbitmq-backing-stores-databases-and-disks/

RabbitMQ does not offer the choice of MySQL as message store provider as
a configuration option, but all the interfaces you will need to
implement your own are abstracted out. See the backing queue Erlang
behaviour:
http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server/file/default/src/rabbit_backing_queue.erl

Hi Emile ,

I was using rabbitMQ 2.4.1 version in my machine, I tried installing 2.7.1
version on top of this without uninstalling the old version ,unfortunately
I was not aware of the remove
Command.

After installing the 2.7.1 version still the RabbitMQ service was pointing
to the Older  version.
So  deleted the Rabbit MQ service  using
sc delete RabitMQ     command

After this when i tried to install Rabbitmq from Command prompt
C:\\program files\rabbitmq server\rabbitmq server 2.7.1
\sbin\rabbitmq-service install

It's  Throwing Error :  "RabbitMQ already present"

but the RabbitMQ service is not there in the services  List.

I tried restarting the machine several times it not working.

when I tried  starting the service

C:\\program files\rabbitmq server\rabbitmq server 2.7.1
\sbin\rabbitmq-service start

I got the below error
"The handle is Invalid"
Thanks & Regards,
Joe

It looks like you got the service into an inconsistent state. I suggest
you try to uninstall the broker and Erlang, reboot and remove all
registry keys under HKLM/SOFTWARE/Ericsson/Erlang/ErlSrv. Then install
Erlang and the broker.

Hi Tim,
Basically I am using all these command on windows 7 through GNUWin32 (I am
not able to understand that when you giving me the solution to make checkout
and make all command in 
rabbitmq-public-umbrella you told that  after executing all these commands
some output has been shown in the command prompt but in my case it give me a
message
C:\Users\ashutosh.trivedi\rabbitmq-public-umbrella>make checkout
The system cannot find the path specified.
make: Nothing to be done for `checkout'.
What the wrong thing I am doing please help me
I am writing my own plugin for security such that I want my own security
system to access rabbitMq Server
Thanks

Ok well it 'looks' as though your Make tool isn't playing nice with some 
file system path or other. The bit of the error message that states 'The 
system cannot find the path specified.' seems to indicate that the path 
handling in the makefile isn't happy, and I don't find this at all 
surprising. GNUWin32 is not a supported build system, AFAIK.

Try running 'VERBOSE=1 make' (or 'make VERBOSE=1') to see a bit more 
output, as it'd be helpful to understand *what* path isn't being picked up.

You could also try installing a Cygwin based tool chain instead, as the 
makefiles *may* rely on tools that aren't present in GNUWin32, including 
Python and possibly some other bits. See 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/build-server.html for a list of things you'll 
also definitely need on your system to build from source, including 
openssl.

So you're going to implement a custom security provider? Are you aware 
that a badly behaving plugin can crash the entire runtime system? See 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html for more details.

What kind of security mechanism are you hoping to provide? Is it 
authentication or authorisation that you're implementing, or both?

Thanks for clarifying Simon. Ashutosh - you'll need to go get Cygwin up 
and running then try again. I'd suggest finding a good tutorial if 
you're not familiar with Cygwin.

It is possible to design and create such a system using RabbitMQ and
there are a few examples, but none that use Android. You might find the
presence exchange developed by Tony Garnock-Jones useful for modelling a
chat room - see https://github.com/tonyg/presence-exchange

You should also take a look at an Erlang implementation by Alvaro
Videla: https://github.com/videlalvaro/rabbitmq-chat

I can't tell you how to design and develop your application, but if you
have specific questions about trade-offs and choices relating to
messaging then please ask.

Check for entries in the logfile that say "connection_closed_abruptly".
If you see many of these simultaeously then you can be fairly certain
that a network interruption is the cause rather than the broker.

Message-ID: <54e49166-7b18-436f-aac5-224896cc1f82@googlegroups.com>


Not sure if this is user error or not, but I am opening a blocking 
connection:

        self.credentials = pika.PlainCredentials(settings.BROKER_USERNAME, 
settings.BROKER_PASSWORD)
        self.connection = 
pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host=settings.BROKER_HOSTNAME, 
port=settings.BROKER_PORT, credentials=self.credentials))
        self.channel = self.connection.channel()
        self.callback_queue = self.channel.queue_declare().method.queue

and I try to close it like this:
        self.channel.queue_delete(queue=self.callback_queue)
        self.connection.close()

However, as seen from Rabbit MQ management console, the connection.close() 
method deletes the channels, but NOT the connection?
Now, the close method calls: BaseConnection.close(self, code, text)
which calls:
        for channel_number in self._channels.keys():
            self._channels[channel_number].close(code, text) # this closes 
the channel

        # If we already dont have any channels, close out
        if not self._channels:
            self._on_close_ready() # never gets here?

If instead, I have:
        self.connection.close()
        self.connection._on_close_ready()

then everything shuts down ok?

The .net user guide has some discussion about acknowledgements in
section 3.2.3 - you can download it from here:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/dotnet.html

The protocol reference has details about basic.nack:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-quickref.html#basic.nack

Your use of the API looks correct. The Subscription class documentation
does not contain a great level of detail because it is a thin wrapper,
but you can see from the implementation of Ack() how to obtain a
DeliveryTag.

Bear in mind that setting the requeue parameter may cause the message to
reach the subscriber again, depending on the presence of other consumers.

Hi,

RabbitMQ was running for several months and it crashed last night. I'm
running version 2.7.1 on Centos 6.2 64 bits.

Where do i find the reason why it crashed?

I checked logs in /var/log/rabbitmq with a grep for ERROR but the only
messages that i found were from 14 May.

That is the correct place to check. The entries span over more than one
line, so 'tail' is perhaps a better choice than 'grep'. What are the
last few entries in the log and the sasl log?

Let me give you an example -- which is an actual workflow we have.

In our web app a user can select to receive a report.  In the web app we
want the user to see that the report is indeed queued, so in the database
we set a flag saying that the job was sent, and when.   This allows us to
display "pending" so the user doesn't submit the request multiple times.

The web app queues the message for the background report generation.
Anything is possible -- so imagine first that the message is somehow lost.
 The web app is still showing "pending" to the user.

But, we do want the task to complete -- it's a revenue generator, for
example.   So, one option is to use cron to look for stale "pending"
request on the web side and assume the message was lost and re-queue.
But, after X attempts maybe the cron job decides to give up.

Now, this report generation actually uses a third-party web service, and
this web service has gone down for extended periods for maintenance.  So,
in this case the report request jobs stack up in the queue.

So, if it's down long enough then cron might run again and re-queue the
same job that is already in the queue.   What I have done for this is
atomically change the state from "pending" to "in process" so that only one
message gets processed.  But, using some kind of UUID and a store is
another option, of course.

Maybe you are right that durable queues are the correct solution for this
-- I still need to track state on the web app side to show "pending" or "in
process".   And maybe just use cron to report/clean up any stale pending
job on the web app side.

I'm just curious if the above is a common design pattern when using
RabbitMQ in this way.  Obviously, depends on the specifics of the task, but
we seem to have quite a few situations like this.

Oh, and with this example of the third-party web service another problem is
knowing if a failure of this service is permanent or temporary.  I have not
done this, but I'm tempted to have my workers pull the jobs off the queue
and if the job fails for an unclear reason then ack the original job and
then send it to a "try again later" queue and have separate workers handle
those.


Thanks,

Check the remote broker logfile for entries about disallowed nodes. If
you see this then you made an error with the .erlang.cookie file. The
troubleshooting page has more details:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/troubleshooting.html

It is also possible that a network or firewall connectivity issue is
preventing nodes from reaching one another. I would suggest trying to
cluster nodes on the same LAN and without firewalls first. Then
gradually add restrictions making sure everything still works as you go.

Are there any other log entries of interest? In particular any do you

What is the output of 'rabbitmqctl status'?

	using multiple queues
Message-ID: <CABPX_bcAQV99BhkUPp7Dc9eqwxAVrFEvd9DXq73U3yiBSjNU1g@mail.gmail.com>

I am writing a consumer (and producer) using Pika.  I want to write
asynchronous code, but I'm having trouble getting everything working.  I
started with regular I pulled off the Pika docs, then made it work with
multiple queues.  To get it working with multiple queues I had to add some
checks that make sure all the queues are declared and bound before trying
to publish any messages.  That worked very well.


Our code also performs some time consuming logic, and we want our consumer
to publish to another queue that will go to some logger.  I tried to add
this on the same channel that was consuming code, but that did not work.  I
wasn't sure if I needed a separate channel, so I tried using 2 channels on
the same connections - 1 channel to consume, and 1 channel to produce, but
that is not working.  I notice when the code is trying to publish the 2nd
log message that everything seems to stop.  Can anyone give me any insight
into what's going on?


Attached are sections of my code:

Hi, thanks for your response.

The file descriptor with the EAGAIN looks like the read end of a pipe to
itself, according to lsof:

beam    1754 rabbitmq    5r     FIFO    0,8      0t0  10971 pipe
beam    1754 rabbitmq    6w     FIFO    0,8      0t0  10971 pipe

Here is etop output. This system also runs couchdb, which may be showing up
in the etop report:

This tight loop condition was repeatable 100% on the system above. I
installed the same rpms onto another rhel6.2 system and the problem did not
occur. I then deleted the contents of /var/lib/rabbitmq and re-created my
single vhost + user. The tight epoll_wait loop is now gone. Before my
purge, the rabbitmq process had over 500 open files similar to the
following:

/var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit at xxxxxxxxx01
/queues/5DQOSIVFS7TNVQV0KQGVZYBSL/journal.jif

The queues directory has not yet been re-created by rabbitmq. This
rabbitmq-server is part of a Chef installation. I will post back if the
problem reoccurs. After the purge, the ntop output looks like this:

So you already have some kind of identity, in order to uniquely identify 
the job in the database.

Well that's true, anything *is* possible. You're entire data centre and 
its resident rabbitmq cluster nodes could all disappear off the face of 
the earth, the hard drives no longer usable, etc. In order to deal with 
that kind of scenario, persistent messages and HA do you no good and 
from a disaster recovery standpoint, you definitely need a way to 
re-synchronise the database and figure out which jobs have actually been 
lost.

It *sounds* to me like you need the house keeping functions to set a

task was resolved.

I'm a bit confused now. Where do you set this 'in process' status - on 
the newly submitted message, or in the database record or in some field 
in the originally submitted message(s)?

I still don't understand the difference between 'stale' and 'pending'. 
Whether you do this based on timestamp or uuid or whatever, you need 
*some* mechanism to avoid duplicating work. Because AMQP cannot reliably 
do 'only once' delivery without consumer intervention, I would expect 
that you need to track which jobs have been handled and which have not. 
What I don't understand is how this pending/stale flag helps you, nor 
why cron jobs are an attractive choice to deal with expiring messages.

It seems to me there are a few separate problem domains here, which are 
getting tangled up in our discussion. I would posit that you need to 
deal with

1. Making sure a job/task has definitely been 'registered' with the system.

2. Indicating the outcome of (1) to your users

3. Avoiding 're-submitting' the same job/task many times

4. Dealing with failures in external services

Please feel free to correct that list or add to it or whatever.

When it comes to (1), as I mentioned durable queues with persistent 
messages are the way to go. Once a message is 'on disk' then it is 
reasonable for you to assume that the job is safely 'in the system' now. 
I won't pretend that this represents a complete disaster recovery 
solution, because we both know it does not. I do feel, however, that 
such a solution involves *far* more technology that just your message 
broker, so I'm going to gently push it out of scope for the purposes of 
this discussion. :)

As for (2), in the absence of queue browsing, you are probably doing the 
right thing already in terms of storing a record in your web 
application's database to indicate that the job has indeed been 
submitted (and is now in a pending state).

Your problem with 'duplicate tasks' appears to happen mainly because 
your cron job 're-submits' the message. With a persistent queue, there 
would be no need to do this at all, as the message is on disk and will 
survive a broker crash (though it won't survive if your data centre 
slips off a cliff into the ocean).

What I'd suggest is a slightly different approach. Set up your durable 
task queue with a 'dead letter exchange' so that expiring messages (or 
those rejected with `requeue=false`) will be shoved into that exchange. 
Now set up the target (dead letter) exchange to publish to another 
(durable) queue, let's call it 'redelivery', and make sure this is 
configured to stay around even when there are no consumers.

Set up a 'permanent subscriber' to the 'redelivery' queue - i.e., have 
an always running thread consuming these messages and make sure it is 
restarted if it fails for any reason - and have this subscriber take 
each arriving message and re-submit it to the original task queue.

Finally, when submitting jobs to the task queue, set the TTL to a 
reasonable value (for your application's needs) and this is what will 
happen:

1. you submit the task
2. the task TTL expires after the correct time lapse
3. the broker sends the 'expired' message to the 'dead letter exchange'
4. the exchange routes the message to the 'redelivery' queue
5. the redelivery queue re-submits the message (as a new message!) to 
the task queue
6. a consumer (job) grabs the message before it expires this time
7. the job (process/thread/application) fails (due to an external 
service error or whatever)
8. the job (process/thread/application) rejects the job with `requeue=false`
9. steps 3, 4 and 5 run again
10. eventually something good happens!?

Actually to deal properly with 10, you probably want to keep some kind 
of timestamp with the message and in the consumer that is reading the 
'redelivery' queue and re-submitting jobs, allow the message to time out 
and set an error flag in the database (or something).

If you *do* have some kind of external identity that holds for the 
(conceptual) lifetime of the task, then you could store this original 
timestamp in the database and query that against the task id, but 
obviously you'll need to consider the potential performance (and 
architectural) implications of doing that for yourself.

Step (8) might also be problematic if your tasks take a long time to 
complete, so you may wish to rework that state in terms of re-submitting 
instead of rejecting the message. As long as you have heartbeats 
enabled, your consumer channel shouldn't be closed, but until you've 
ack'ed the message one way or another, other consumers could 'get' it 
and therefore you'll need to make them idempotent to deal with this.

What ever you choose to do, the database needs to be properly updated 
when a task does finally succeed. The fact that you *must* do this at 
some point already (in order for the UI to be consistent) means you 
already have a thread of identity, and therefore you should be able to 
use this to create idempotent consumers where duplicate tasks are 
potentially an issue.

That sounds like a reasonable approach. It is somewhat similar to the 
approach I describe above.

Hi,

As i restarted RabbitMQ it's already writing at logs again. The restart was
done around 09:00 when i detected that it crashed.

My sasl log is empty and rabbit at host.log has a lot of these lines:
http://pastebin.com/PDFyCjzc. Which is ok.

Looking with "less" near the crash time, what i found is that it stopped
receiving requests around 05:00 and only restarted at 09:00 when i ran
rabbitmq restart.

Here is the log http://pastebin.com/0v4RiN2i

Thanks for the help.

The application database.  When the user say "I want a report" then flag
the start time, and the state (initially "pending") and send of the
message.

The idea is the worker picks up the job and atomically sets it from
"pending" to "in process" -- which means even if the job was queued
multiple times only one process would pick up the actual work.

Then when the job is completed again the state is changed from "in process"
to "completed".

Well, that's essentially my question.  Obviously, if I want the web app to
know that a report request was made so it can display to the user that the
report is in the process of being generated.  And I also want to prevent
multiple submissions by a user for the same thing.  So, the database serves
this function.

The difficulty is when it gets stuck in pending.   At what point do we give
up or try again?

Thans for your comments below.  I think the solution with the dead letter
is the way to go as it avoids using something like cron to handle extra
processing.   This way the task is always "in the system" in a controlled
way.

Then not over engineer for the very rare chance of a failure.   May don't
even really need the durable queues if I can run a utility to resubmit
stuck "pending" jobs in those rare cases.


Thanks very much for your input.

 multiple masters

Francesco,

Thanks very much for the detailed reply. It was extremely helpful.

A few more clarifying questions and background.

All of our nodes are disk-based.
Version upgrades aren't an issue. We plan to keep all nodes in lock step.

Question 1
----------------
When you suggested starting a cluster after an abrupt, unplanned
shutdown of all nodes, you said:

> 1) Start one disc node. If it hangs waiting for the table, try the next one until one works.

I stumbled across this in my own previous experimentation. The
question is, do I risk message loss by first starting a node that
joined the cluster late, thus not having the full set of messages that
other nodes have?

Question 2
---------------
Related to the above scenario, is there any danger (after an unplanned
shutdown), in simply letting all the nodes start in parallel and
letting Mnesia's waiting sort out the order? It seems to work OK in my
limited testing so far, but I don't know if we're risking data loss.


Question 3
---------------
You said:

> In other words, it's up to you to restart them so that the node with the most up-to-date mnesia is started first

Is there any information recorded somewhere (e.g. the logs), which
would indicate which node has the "most up to date" Mnesia database? I
see messages like:

 > Mirrored-queue (queue 'charon' in vhost '/'): Promoting slave
<rabbit at play2.1.273.0> to master

But don't know if they're necessarily correlated to who the most
up-to-date Mnesia is.


Thanks very much for your help on this,

Matt

Message-ID: <A23CE3B9A6B78A4BBBC6A1AE3C306DCD9B71B18948@NA-MAIL-1-3.rws.ad.ea.com>

I have seen a couple of other threads about this, most notably "Beginner Issue with RabbitMQ".  I am running Python 2.7.3 on RHEL 5.8, 64 bit, and followed the instructions on the website to install RabbitMQ 2.8.2-1.  I then did the first Python tutorial.  It didn't work - the code ran, rabbitmqctl status reported OK, but no messages came through.

I also picked up a copy of the book, RabbitMQ in Action, and tried the first code in that book (Chapter 2) with the same results.

remain blocked (rabbitmqctl list_connections) after sending the message and=
 exiting.

Following the suggestion from Phillipp Wollermann, I removed RabbitMQ and i=
nstalled version 2.2.0-1.el5 from EPEL.  The tutorial code now works fine.

I think that new versions of important software should be regression tested=
 on multiple platforms before publishing... :)

We have encountered issues in RabbitMQ 2.8.2 and greater with the default 'disk_free_limit' monitoring. If you are running on a system with more available RAM than disk space out of the box, RabbitMQ will block consumers in its default configuration.

We worked around this by configuring the RabbitMQ disk_free_limit threshold to be less than the default of 1. For example, to enforce the blocking of publishing only when the available disk is 10% of the memory on the system, create the file /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config and add the following setting (don't forget the trailing period):

[
{rabbit, [{disk_free_limit, {mem_relative, 0.1}}]}
].

For more information, see 'Disk-Based Flow Control' documentation here: http://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#diskfreesup

We are surprised by how many people get caught out by that.

Are there perhaps some popular Amazon EC2 images that are configured 
with very little disk space in /var/lib?

Yes I do agree that keeping it simple is always best. A couple of points 
to bare in mind though. Durable queues are queue 'definitions' that will 
survive a restart or crash and have nothing to do with storing messages 
on disk. Persistent messages (sent with delivery_mode=2) are what causes 
things to hit the disk before they're confirmed. As these two factors 
are influenced merely by configuration (of the queue during the 
'declare' method) and header setting (on the client) I'd expect they add 
enough value for minimal design input not to be considered overhead, 
although there is obviously a cost in performance and disk use when 
fsync'ing everything to disk.

Without durable queues, your application startup code needs to handle 
queue declaration and setup. Doing without persistence is fine, but bare 
in mind that the broker could ack a message and crash moments later, 
causing the job to be completely lost if the messages aren't persistent 
and the queues are not HA/mirrored queues. Admittedly your database 
record of the job submission alleviates this risk to some extent, but 
your housekeeping utility will need to handle messages that are 
completely missing in this case, as well as re-submiting 'stuck' jobs. 
Producer confirms and persistence remove this risk, such that restarting 
the broker (after a crash or otherwise) will cause the queues to come up 
into their proper state and the producer will always know for sure 
whether or not the broker actually received a message due to the confirm 
being sent back. This pattern should simplify the rest of the 
application code somewhat.

We saw it on a pretty powerful system - 128 GiB of memory, but only around 120 GiB of free disk space. Others have seen in on smaller test VMs which have 8-16 GiB of memory but had a small disk.

Is it possible to change the disk_free_limit to be based on the size of the queued messages in RabbitMQ instead of the total amount of memory on the system?

Is the latter due to some default settings or do people intentionally 
configure the VMs that way?

We have considered all kinds of alternatives, and are indeed still 
mulling over them given the problems people are having with the current 
arrangements.

We do need to leave quite some safety margin since we cannot monitor 
disk space continuously, only sample it, nor can we calculate precisely 
how much disk space we may need.

The worst case scenario we have been looking at is a vast volume of 
persistent messages suddenly getting dumped into rabbit. Memory-based 
flow control will kick in and stem the influx, but conceivably not until 
close to 100% of memory is taken up. This can all happen in a matter of 
seconds. And then rabbit has to write all these messages to disk; and 
it'd better have the space available to do so or things will go badly wrong.

Regards,

Matthias.

I'm very sorry - I already had to reinstall the servers with Debian to get on?
I tried to reproduce the issue with Scientific Linux 6.2 in VMware, but it just worked out of the box, as expected.

There were absolutely no suspicious log entries and nothing referring to "alarm_handler" - just connections getting accepted and that's it.
I don't have the output of rabbitmqctl anymore, but I remember one thing that seemed strange to me: "Channels" were piling up, one got added for each invocation of "./send.py" (from the Hello World example).

If I can reproduce the bug, I'll get back to this thread for sure.

Thanks,
Philipp

Yeah,I'm sure,the connection of http://127.0.0.1:55674/stomp is ok.

The "Lost connection" error appearing in Firefox(v.13) or Chrome(v.17), but connected to rabbitmq successfully in IE8.

I don't know where the problem at! 

Need your help!

Best Regards!

Are you sure RabbitMQ-Web-Stomp is actually listening on localhost
on this port?
You can verify it by opening your browser at this url:
  http://127.0.0.1:55674/stomp
you should see SockJS hello message.

Thanks for clarifying Simon. Ashutosh - you'll need to go get Cygwin up 
and running then try again. I'd suggest finding a good tutorial if 
you're not familiar with Cygwin.

It should be fine, but in general it's better to do cluster operations
sequentially and at one site. In this specific case it should be OK.

Well, the fact that something got promoted to master tells you that
the previous master definitely went down before the promoted node.

There won't be precise information if you stop the nodes abruptly, but
you can look at "rabbit on node <node> down" messages in the logs -
the node in the clusters are linked in distributed Erlang and these
messages are generated when a node receives a 'DOWN' message from
another node. Since they are "info" messages, you need to make sure to
have those enabled - they are enabled by default but a lot of people
don't like them.

Hi Tim,

I want to ask you a question why should I face all these type of error like
that  xsltproc command not found, but nothing will be written in the
rabbitMq_in_action.pdf book and rabbitMq website .

Could I doing something wrong or it happens

Regarding the RabbitMQ in Action book, we target mostly the Unix
environment during the plugins chapter.

Regarding the rabbitmq-public-umbrella I can't comment if it works on a
Windows environment or on how to set it up properly for Windows.

Message-ID: <CAECZ850EcVLSU_w+nt4Y_Yp47xh9Jw0dfMyAfSE1hW5MZ270JQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm having a problem in that sending and receiving messages is fine,
but doing either of these commands:

rabbitmqctl list_exchanges
rabbitmqctl list_queues
rabbitmqctl list_bindings
rabbitmqctl delete_user
rabbitmqctl add_user
rabbitmqctl delete_vhost
rabbitmqctl add_vhost
rabbitmqctl set_permissions
rabbitmqctl stop

echoes the following to stderr:

{"init terminating in
do_boot",{undef,[{rabbit_control,start,[]},{init,start_it,1},{init,start_em,1}]}}

Crash dump was written to: erl_crash.dump
init terminating in do_boot ()

and rabbitmq-server results in:

{"init terminating in
do_boot",{undef,[{rabbit_prelaunch,start,[]},{init,start_it,1},{init,start_em,1}]}}

Crash dump was written to: erl_crash.dump
init terminating in do_boot ()

My Rabbit version is the latest from MacPorts on OSX 10.6 (and will
not tell me itself).

My erl_crash.dump:

Hi,

I have this same problem ("Hello World" tutorial not working)...I had
rabbit working before but then decided to uninstall it. I have now
re-installed it and it seems to start up fine and lists the queue "hello 0"
when I list queues but messages do not seem to be received at all. Is there
a reason for something like this? I've already put in over 2 hours trying
to get it working like it was before.

Thanks,
Devin

Most tutorials deal with installing RabbitMQ, not building it.

The first google hit for "RabbitMQ building" is this:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/build-server.html , which instructs you to
install those utilities.

The most common reason for this in version 2.8.2 is not having enough
disk space. Check if the broker logfile contains a message to that
effect. You can solve the problem by requiring less free disk space or
by making sufficient disk space available on the partition that the
broker uses. See

http://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#diskfreesup

Hi Ashutosh,

Well there are a couple of things to consider here. We did not write 'RabbitMQ In Action' although we are good friends with the author! If you feel these things are missing from that book then probably the best thing you can do to help future readers is submit this information as errata (or some such) to the author or publisher and ask for it to be included in the next edition!

The RabbitMQ website *does* list this information quite clearly on http://www.rabbitmq.com/build-server.html under the section "Required Libraries and Tools" - we mention xsltproc (which is part of libxslt) as well as python. 

I think the other problem you're having is that you're using MSys whereas Simon previously mentioned that Cygwin is probably the only sensible approach to building. I am sorry for suggesting MSys, as I was unaware it wouldn't work for you, although if you read my response to Simon's email earlier in the thread, you will note that I said "Ashutosh - you'll need to go get Cygwin up and running then try again".

Building RabbitMQ from source *does* require a basic understanding of Make and other common unix tools, and if you're attempting to do this in a Windows environment then you will need to understand *how* to achieve that by yourself, as there is nothing rabbit specific about these errors you're experiencing. As I said, I was mistaken in suggesting you use MSys, but I did say afterwards that you should switch to Cygwin.

Please bare in mind that we don't recommend building from source unless you're comfortable with these kinds of tools and that on Windows, as far as we know, you will need to use a 'unix environment on windows' such as Cygwin. I would also strongly recommend that you consider carefully whether writing a plugin is a suitable mechanism for fulfilling your requirements, as plugin authors need to have a strong understanding of Erlang/OTP as their code will be running *inside the broker* and any issues in the plugin could potentially bring down the whole system. Security can often be implemented in other, non application specific ways, using border control and/or agent based delegation instead of relying on complex logic running inside a message broker.  

Hope that helps.

Cheers,
Tim

I think not mentioning the link to http://www.rabbitmq.com/build-server.html is
a big oversight on my part while writing the book. Sorry for that.

Thanks for the update, Steve.

You appear to be running on RedHat (please confirm)?

Since many of the responses on this mailing list will be "you should
upgrade to the latest release" it would be good to get a better handle
on why 2.8.2 doesn't run for you. Which of the mailing list references
did you discover that you felt was relevant to your problem?

As you said, this log does not contain anything useful, which is
unusual. Check whether there was enough diskspace to write to the
logfile. Alternative check for the presence of an erl_crash.dump in the
home folder of the rabbitmq user. You should also check whether the sasl
log contains entries over the relevant period.

Hi Emile,

In fact there is erl_crash.dump generated at Jun 18 05:42. Should i host
this file somewhere and post the link here? Or does it contain sensitive
data?

Most tutorials deal with installing RabbitMQ, not building it.

The first google hit for "RabbitMQ building" is this:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/build-server.html , which instructs you to
install those utilities.

In most cases the slogan is the most interesting information. If that
doesn't offer a clue then the contents is unlikely to, but feel free to
inspect it using the viewer as explained here:

http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/crash_dump.html

or compress and send it to me (not the list) if your application does
not process confidential information.

Hi Dan,

The Erlang crash dumps for rabbitmq-server and rabbitmqctl are because
of failures to run these Erlang programs (actually a prelaunch program
in the former case). They should not affect the rabbitmq-server service
if it is already running (which it appears to be since you say sending
and receiving messages are fine).

I assume that by the latest version of rabbitmq you are running
rabbitmq-server 2.8.2, and Erlang R15B, which is what I get from my
macports (on OS X 10.6.8, macports 2.1.1). You should check that any
earlier version(s) is(are) uninstalled.

Did you run `sudo port load rabbitmq-server` which starts the service in
the background?

Now accessing the rabbitmqctl and rabbitmq-server scripts from the
command line requires that you issue them as root, done with sudo:

    sudo rabbitmqctl status

This should give a reasonable response.

To see if the server has problems you should look in the log directory
(/opt/local/var/log/rabbitmq/*) where you should have two logs for each
rabbitmq node you run. (By default this is rabbit@<hostname>.log and
-sasl.log.) I suspect there will be nothing untoward there.

I cannot reproduce your symptoms unless I disable the -pa option on the
(eventual) erl command, so it looks as though you have an environment
problem. Please check the following directory:

    /opt/local/lib/rabbitmq/lib/rabbitmq_server-2.8.2/

and see if the scripts are in sbin/, and there are a lot of beam files
in ebin/.

PS: 
[You might be using a non-standard prefix for macport install
files -- if so, the /opt/local in this directory path might be something
different for you -- and we may have a bug, since we are supposed to
cope with that.]

Matthias,

When 2.8.2 rolled, we also got snagged by this.  It was actually a bit of a
mess for us.  Like a lot of companies, we are lean on administrators (500+
servers per administrator) and fast moving.  Rabbit is newer in our
infrastructure but its been really stable, so we had classified it as
"production safe" for both the application and its packaging.  In our case,
we've re-classified the packaging as "development" meaning that when a new
version rolls, it has to be manually upgraded (sent through the QA process
to test for this sort of breakage.)

Its getting more and more common for our machines to have large memory
spaces, and more and more common that applications run almost entirely out
of memory.  My guess is that others see the same trend upwards in memory
size... so this is probably something you'll continue to have more issues
with rather than less.  Given that trend, I'd recommend that the packaging
check for this state (if upgrading from <2.8.2) and fail the upgrade if the
appropriate values aren't set (i.e. you'll end up with a failed Rabbit at
the end of the upgrade.)   For people starting with 2.8.2+, you might
consider re-visiting the hard failure and making this a warning state
instead...  seems to me there's a valid argument to throw a warning here
rather than blocking (however, I could be entirely incorrect about that.)

The trouble is that AMQP doesn't give us the ability to warn-on-publish 
(and even if it did it's easy to imagine that the typical default client 
callback would be a no-op). So it's not clear where a warning would go - 
we already write to logs and show a big red thing in mgmt, but from the 
number of questions we're getting asked it's clear people are not seeing 
these.

However, there's no denying that this has hurt a lot more people than we 
expected, and we really don't like that.

So for the next release we're intending to go with a lower disk space 
limit - probably a hard 1GB. This is not ideal - ideally we would always 
have the ability to page the whole of memory out to disk - but it's at 
least somewhat likely to stop you before you *actually* run out of disk 
space and crash, while hopefully not causing the wave of false-positives 
that have inconvenienced people running 2.8.2.

Cheers, Simon

The slogan is this one:

Slogan: eheap_alloc: Cannot allocate 1571344 bytes of memory (of type
"heap").

Here is the initial content of the dump file ( http://pastebin.com/qTN5z53W).

Is there an internal limit for erlang processes? Because this machine has a
lot of memory ( 96GB ) and now, under heavy usage, there is still 60GB free.

Hi,

The Erlang VM crashed because the OS could not allocate 1571344 bytes of
memory, and it doesn't look like the Erlang VM was using much memory
when it crashed. Do you have any other services running on the same
server? That is not recommended.

No, there is no limit. RabbitMQ expects to be able to use all the RAM in
the server. You can control how soon memory-conserving strategies are
applied with the memory high watermark setting. See

Steve Powell asked for my system particulars.  This is a standalone system (Dell 1950) with 16 GB RAM.

Redhat Release:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.8 (Tikanga)

Linux Kernel:
Linux 2.6.18-308.el5 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 17:17:51 EST 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Disk space:

Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/Sys-root  992M  248M  694M  27% /
/dev/mapper/Sys-opt    60G  805M   56G   2% /opt

/dev/mapper/Sys-vtmp  992M   34M  908M   4% /var/tmp

tmpfs                 7.9G     0  7.9G   0% /dev/shm


Since the assumption for the issue is that there is not enough disk space for RabbitMQ, or rather, that RabbitMQ requires 16GB of free disk space.  Obviously, it would be best if we could use a directory under /opt for disk space.  Looks like I do this with the environment variable RABBITMQ_MNESIA_BASE?

I'll reinstall and try that.

FWIW, I think the install docs should mention this issue, the above disk layout is pretty standard in our shop (we generally install application stuff in /opt).    But the main install page does not mention the default directories where stuff goes, nor how to change where you install or keep files.  In fact, to find the above environment variable I had to look at the man pages...  seems to me newbies should know this stuff first.

Thanks,

I have found a couple quirks:
- publishing a single message to a single queue works
- publishing multiple messages to a single queue still crashes the code
Still no fix to the problem though.

Yes, we have other services like mysql and apache. But RabbitMQ usage is
very low. We have less than 1.000 messages/day.

I think that is very unlikely for our server to run out of memory,
specially because we usually have a lot of free memory and swap usage is 0.
In any case, i installed munin in order to have some data about resource
usage if this issue happens again.

Thanks for the help. I will get back here in case this problem happens
again.

Ah, I see.  Even if AMQP had a warn-on-publish strategy, that would require
code changes for everyone, so that's a non-starter.  Here, we watch logs
and the management interface - it seems to me (granted I'm from the ops
world more than the dev world) that users of Rabbit should be watching
those...  in this case for a warning that said something about insufficient
disk space to page out the full memory footprint.  If that was OK and
understood, maybe a flag in the config file could be set to silence that
warning.

For example, one of the applications we have under development will be very
high throughput and time sensitive (meaning that the value of the messages
decays very quickly.)  In the event we had a failure that ended up hitting
disk, we'd end up with zero value in the messages anyway, so in that
particular case we'd be running with big memory, almost no disk, and all
warnings suppressed.

Hmmm.  Well, its just my opinion, keep in mind that I'm sure you know far
more than I do about what all the Rabbit users need - but if it were my
choice I'd probably consider that a compromise where no one wins overall -
it lowers the bar.  I certainly understand what you were trying to achieve
with the current limits - more stable and consistent outcomes for the vast
majority of users.  I'd either:

1) Stick to your original guns and let us all adjust to best practices.
2) Move this from a block to a warn (in log + management) (my favorite, it
would not shut people off, but it would firmly tell us all that we should
be aware of *why* we are breaking what is a good practice.)

This option seems less attractive:

3) Assign a lower floor.  You'll move the problem quantitatively, but not
qualitatively...  those that hit the limit will still be confused (you'll
discover how many people have <1GB /var ).  Those who don't have enough
disk to page out memory might be in for a very nasty surprise, since they
won't get warned of the potential issue in advance, they might end up
pretty unhappy in a failure mode.

Again, I might be off base here...

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Basic.Reject(requeue=true) is no longer working
 after updating to 2.8.2
Message-ID: <be863d24-11d1-45ec-a13d-5fdd1eedfeb5@googlegroups.com>

Hi.

I've upgraded my queue server to RabbitMQ 2.8.2, and 
Basic.Reject(requeue=true) is no longer working for me. When I reject a 
message using it, the message isn't being requeued (i.e, going to the back 
of the queue). In fact the message remains unacknowledged, and if I try to 
get the next message from the queue, I get the very same message I had just 
rejected, and my consumer won't process any new messages.

After doing some research, I've found this:

"Message ordering guarantees

(...) Messages can be returned to the queue using AMQP methods that feature 
a requeue parameter (basic.recover, basic.reject and basic.nack), or due to 
a channel closing while holding unacknowledged messages. Any of these 
scenarios caused messages to be requeued at the back of the queue for 
RabbitMQ releases earlier than 2.7.0. From RabbitMQ release 2.7.0, messages 
are always held in the queue in publication order, even in the presence of 
requeueing or channel closure."

Given that, I can no longer rely on Basic.Reject() to send messages to the 
back of the queue? To do so, must I manually publish the message to the 
queue?

Thanks in advance.

Michael

Francesco,

Thanks again for the valuable insight from your reply. I'm down to one
issue at this point.

Given what you said earlier about it being OK to start the brokers in any
order, I wrote a simple "catastrophic stress" test. The good news is that
RabbitMQ does what's expected. The bad news: Only most of the time, i.e.
about 90%.

Here's what the test does:

In a loop (5 times):
    Write 5 messages to a queue comprised of 3 clustered nodes (disk based).
    Kill all RabbitMQ's as quickly as possible - I use "killall beam.smp"
invoked on all nodes simultaneously via Capistrano.
    Restart all nodes in parallel (again, using Capistrano).
    Verify that each previously written message can be received.

~90% of the time, an iteration runs to completion as expected. About 10% of
the time, one of the nodes fails to start,
getting stuck with the last line being "starting database ..."

I see nothing of note in the rabbit@<node>.log file.

When this happens, I have no luck getting the node to join the cluster.
Even attempting a "rabbitmqctl force_reset" hangs. The only way I can get
the cluster fully formed again is to terminate all the nodes, then bring
them back up. (A reset is not required in this case, however.)

For what it's worth, the broker start logic looks like this
    nohup rabbitmq-server &
    rabbitmqctl wait <pidfile>

Are their any trace options or other places to look to understand why a
node gets stuck on "creating database..." ?

This bit of startup unpredictability is causing a lot of concern with our
VP. I've been tasked with coming up with the complete story, and
workarounds to any problems like this.

Thanks very much again,

Matt

I reinstalled 2.8.2-1 and set the MNESIA_BASE configuration variable to /opt/rabbitmq/mnesia

Since there is sufficient space in this volume to match memory size, it just works.  Yay!  High Paw!

Now on to serious development; I am sure you all will be hearing more questions from me.  Thanks to Steve Powell and Tim Watson for steering me in the right direction, though I still think the installation docs should mention this issue.

Steve Powell asked for my system particulars.  This is a standalone system (Dell 1950) with 16 GB RAM.

Redhat Release:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.8 (Tikanga)

Linux Kernel:
Linux 2.6.18-308.el5 #1 SMP Fri Jan 27 17:17:51 EST 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Disk space:

/dev/mapper/Sys-root  992M  248M  694M  27% /
/dev/mapper/Sys-opt    60G  805M   56G   2% /opt

tmpfs                 7.9G     0  7.9G   0% /dev/shm


Since the assumption for the issue is that there is not enough disk space for RabbitMQ, or rather, that RabbitMQ requires 16GB of free disk space.  Obviously, it would be best if we could use a directory under /opt for disk space.  Looks like I do this with the environment variable RABBITMQ_MNESIA_BASE?

I'll reinstall and try that.

FWIW, I think the install docs should mention this issue, the above disk layout is pretty standard in our shop (we generally install application stuff in /opt).    But the main install page does not mention the default directories where stuff goes, nor how to change where you install or keep files.  In fact, to find the above environment variable I had to look at the man pages...  seems to me newbies should know this stuff first.

Thanks,

Ashutosh - this mailing list is an important resource for rabbit users (e.g., other people having difficulty building on Windows perhaps) so please remember to cc the list. 

From what I can see, you are still not building the top level dependencies first. You need to build in the right order (although http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html claims that you can just cd into a plugin sub-directory and build, so I'll validate that and update either the documentation of this thread, depending on which is correct). I did

% hg clone <path>
% cd rabbitmq-public-umbrella
% make checkout
% make all

Now in answer to your question 'Which file path he is asking to exists' [sic] - the answer is right in front of you!  The output says "can't find include lib "rabbit_common/include/rabbit.hrl" so that is the file which is missing! I will admit this is a bit opaque as the rabbit_common library is built from the rabbitmq-erlang-client sources, which I'll admit is confusing at first. Anyway, by the looks of things you're probably doing one of two things wrong, either

1. you've forgotten to run make checkout (or it hasn't run properly) or...
2. you're building from the wrong directory or....
3. some other strange thing is happening that I can't replicate at the moment

From the /c/Users/..... path in the output, it looks like you're using Cygwin now, which is great. I do keep a windows environment around for testing, but it's not configured for building and from speaking to a colleague who *has* tried building on Windows, there are going to be numerous other gotchas down the line. We are 'all hands on deck' at the moment so I cannot promise when (or even if) I will have time to install Cygwin (etc) in a Windows environment and figure out what steps are causing you these issues. 

If I were in your shoes, I would make my life a lot easier (and progress a lot faster) and install linux on a virtual machine and use that instead. You will have a *lot* less headaches doing that and the installation of Erlang and everything else is *very* well documented on the internet.

Cheers,
Tim

Ashutosh - this mailing list is an important resource for rabbit users
(e.g., other people having difficulty building on Windows perhaps) so please
remember to cc the list.

first. You need to build in the right order (although
http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html claims that you can just cd
into a plugin sub-directory and build, so I'll validate that and update
either the documentation of this thread, depending on which is correct). I
did

 

% hg clone <path>

% cd rabbitmq-public-umbrella

% make checkout

% make all

 

Now in answer to your question 'Which file path he is asking to exists'
[sic] - the answer is right in front of you!  The output says "can't find
include lib "rabbit_common/include/rabbit.hrl" so that is the file which is
missing! I will admit this is a bit opaque as the rabbit_common library is
built from the rabbitmq-erlang-client sources, which I'll admit is confusing
at first. Anyway, by the looks of things you're probably doing one of two
things wrong, either

 

1. you've forgotten to run make checkout (or it hasn't run properly) or...

2. you're building from the wrong directory or....

3. some other strange thing is happening that I can't replicate at the
moment

Cygwin now, which is great. I do keep a windows environment around for
testing, but it's not configured for building and from speaking to a
colleague who *has* tried building on Windows, there are going to be
numerous other gotchas down the line. We are 'all hands on deck' at the
moment so I cannot promise when (or even if) I will have time to install
Cygwin (etc) in a Windows environment and figure out what steps are causing
you these issues. 

 

If I were in your shoes, I would make my life a lot easier (and progress a
lot faster) and install linux on a virtual machine and use that instead. You
will have a *lot* less headaches doing that and the installation of Erlang
and everything else is *very* well documented on the internet.

 

Cheers,

Tim

It means that checkout has already been run successfully.

This should not be happening. The patch that the makefile is trying to apply has *already* been applied - that's clearly what the message states - so it should just be ignored by the makefile. This might be a Cygwin oddity.

Look at rabbitmq-public-umbrella/rabbitmq-erlang-client/common.mk - that is how rabbit-common is generated (it contains sources and headers from the broker code base which resides in rabbitmq-server). 

> Thanks

You're welcome. I am not going to continue looking at this issue however, for the reasons I mentioned previously. If you want to get this built from source then install a unix based operating system on a vm and you'll find all the tips you need to build from source in the RabbitMQ in Action book, old threads on this mailing list and on the internet in general. I can't reproduce your build problems without setting up a windows build environment and I do not have time to do that right now. If and when I do get around to that in the future, I'll be sure to write up any helpful hints and tips required. 

Cheers,
Tim

It's also at http://www.rabbitmq.com/relocate.html. But maybe the 
installation docs should mention this - the trouble is, you can make a 
case for the installation docs mentioning everything...

We might introduce some additional disc space warning threshold in a 
future release. The trouble is if you *just* warn then people who don't 
look at mgmt / logs (which believe me, is a lot of people!) will get the 
same nasty surprise on running out of disc space as they did on releases 
prior to 2.8.2; they don't get any benefit from the monitoring at all. 
So this is actually worse for them.

Hence the desire for a compromise setting.

Take a look at the chrome inspector (developer tools) and
see outgoing network connections.

Maybe you'll be able to figure out what particular network connections
fail and why.

You can also send me a screenshot of the network tab from
chrome inspector.

That command should have been "etop -node" followed by the node of the
broker (typically rabbit at host). By default "etop" reports about the node
it is running, which is not very useful.

As I mentioned in another post, I did try this and it worked.  

About the installation docs - this is a change in flow control from previous versions, that can cause the poor newbie (that is, me...) to conclude that the product doesn't work.  A simple note that you have to make sure that the disk space available must be at least as much as the RAM available, accompanied by another simple note on the default directories used, would prevent this kind of issue.  Or at least mention it in the first tutorial.  Lots of folks will install RabbitMQ following the directions exactly, and run tutorial 1, and not be able to proceed because of this.  In this day and age of cheap RAM, a system like mine, with /var at 4GB and RAM at 16 GB will not be uncommon.  

I wouldn't say this if I were the only one who experienced the problem, but obviously I am not.

Thanks,
-Steve Keller

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Filter out messages from self
Message-ID: <1340217486.973317063@apps.rackspace.com>


Afternoon Everybody,

 
I would like to implement a feature where a Rabbit client does not receive any messages published by itself. The client will be listening on an exclusive Q that is bound to exactly one exchange.  That exchange will be bound to multiple exchanges.
 
I am about to implement this feature by filtering the messages after they have been received by the client using the props builder to identify the sender, but, I would like to know if there is a silver bullet that I have overlooked - some way to avoid receiving the messages in the first place (without cludging together all of the "other users" as binding keys).
 
Any quick fix that I am ignorant of?
 
Using:
Rabbit 2.8.1 broker running on Ubuntu 11
Java and C++ clients
persistent topic exchanges
persistent Qs
 
 
Flow:
 
User1_Q1 ->publish-> Ex99
User2_Q2 <-receive <- Ex2 <- Ex99
User3_Q3 <-receive <- Ex3 <- Ex99
User1_Q1 <- Ex1  x receive x   Ex99 //user who publishes message does not receive
 
 
User3_Q3 ->publish-> Ex99

AMQP defines no-local as a parameter to basicConsume which is intended to
provide the feature you're requesting.   However, AFAIK support for
no-local is not implemented in RabbitMQ.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Incorrect display of mirrored queues as
	unsynchronised after database failover
Message-ID: <CACLE7iy7mosnq+GSJHDC_z_N5fxtC0GRujTk2MMUibiBSJVrgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Back before 2.8.0 was announced, I reported an issue with Mirrored queues
reporting some nodes as unsynchronized.  SimonM says it was fixed, per the
release notes:

- fix incorrect display of mirrored queues as unsynchronised after database
  failover


However, I'm still seeing the issue in 2.8.2. In our cluster with several
mirrored queues in a three-node cluster, I do a "rolling upgrade" operation
wherein I restart each node in sequence. After bring each node back up I
wait for the queue to become fully synchronized before moving on to the
next node.

At the beginning of the rolling restart, the queue has no messages in it
and the management UI says there are two synchronized nodes in addition to
the master.

At some later point after restarting a node, the management console and
HTTP API report that one of the nodes is unsynchronized, despite there
being 0 messages in the queue.

I have verbose mnesia tracing enabled if this would help track down the
problem.

Thanks,

Matt

Take a look at the chrome inspector (developer tools) and
see outgoing network connections.
Maybe you'll be able to figure out what particular network connections
fail and why.
You can also send me a screenshot of the network tab from
chrome inspector.

Hi,
I've tried installing the web-stomp plugin on Debian Squeeze, following 
the notes here: 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2012/05/14/introducing-rabbitmq-web-stomp/

However, Rabbit fails to start, with the error:
Crash dump was written to: erl_crash.dump
Kernel pid terminated (application_controller) 
({application_start_failure,cowboy,{shutdown,{cowboy_app,start,[normal,[]]}}})


I've uploaded that erl_crash.dump here (compressed):

PS. I've tried on Ubuntu Precise, and it works OK there, using exactly 
the same .deb file.

Hello guys.

I'm trying to build RPC using PHP, here is my description of problem:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11104004/rabbitmq-rpc-exclusive-queues-locking-php

The main issue I suspect is that Client.php and Server.php try to connect 
to RabbitMQ server using different connections, which leads to inability of 
using EXCLUSIVE queue (that is declared in CLient.php) from Server.php

Can u give me a way I can dig to? I'm out of ideas ...

Sorry for me writing here: I can't figure out how to use mailing list for 
replies =/


My Client.php declares callback queue php-object as following:

$callbackQueue = new \AMQPQueue($channel);
$callbackQueue->setFlags(AMQP_EXCLUSIVE); // set EXCLUSIVE flag
$callbackQueue->declare();

After that I pass it's name at an envelope to server like this 
($callbackQueue->getName at 'reply_to')

$exchange->publish(
    json_encode(array('process me!')),
    'temp_action',
    AMQP_MANDATORY,
    array(
        'reply_to' => $callbackQueue->getName(), // pass callback queue name
        'correlation_id' => $correlationId
    )
);


And my Server.php creates a new Queue php-object (in an anonymous function 
that handles consuming) as following:

    $callbackQueue = new \AMQPQueue($channel);
    $callbackQueue->setName($envelope->getReplyTo());
    $callbackQueue->setFlags(AMQP_EXCLUSIVE); // set EXCLUSIVE flag

Right after that moment I'm trying to bind newly created $callbackQueue 
object to an exchange - and this causes blocking issue.


I'm not sure which exact options are different (exclusive looks for me to 
be the only flag I set in both cases). 
Setting name in Server.php is necessary and name is taken from envelope's 
'reply_to' setting. 

As far as I can see no extra declaration of callback queue is happening on 
a Server.php side. (Although tempQueue Server consumes messages from is 
extra declared, but this is made for server to be able to listen that queue 
even when before any client exists)

Hi Dennis.

The whole point of an exclusive queue is that it is accessible solely by 
the connection that declares it. You don't want to declare a queue as 
exclusive if it is going to be used by more than one connection.

So I'm not sure why you are declaring it exclusive? If you are trying to 
make sure that it goes away when the client connection does, you 
probably want to make it autodelete - then it will be deleted when the 
client connection stops consuming from it.

Cheers, Simon

As far as I can see: my server.php and client.php scripts create *different 
channels* (and different connections) which seems to contradict the nature 
of exclusive queues. 
And I cannot see any way to reuse same channel (that is created at 
client.php) at server.php.

This probably means that I cannot use "official" PECL extension from 
php.net for building RPC at 
RabbitMQ: http://www.php.net/manual/en/amqp.installation.php
I think this issue may be considered as solved: impossible to use this 
library for RPC :-/

Thank you

Oh, absolutely. We're a bit surprised at how many people have been 
caught out by this, and plan on making some changes in the next release,

Oh, of course. I'm being slow today.

You just don't need to declare the queue on the RPC server, the client 
will already have declared it. And the server can publish to it by 
publishing to the default exchange (named "") with a routing key of the 
queue's name. Does this make sense?

Thanks, now it's clear.

SockJS misbehaves, this is caused by the fact you're running your
html from file:// address, ie: without a web server.

In theory SockJS should work in such case, I'll try to trace why it doesn't.

Please, consider serving your html file from http:// web server in the
meaintime.

I might suggest using simple built-in python web server:

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Thanks for reporting this!

Most likely you're using too old erlang runtime on debian. As mentioned
in the blog post [1], you need Erlang R14.

Can you make sure that you have at least R14 on debian?

Ah, but it's the removal of 2.8.2 that is failing. So you're seeing the 
bug in 2.8.2 when upgrading to 2.8.3 - not much we can do about that I'm 
afraid.

Version 2.8.2 of the Debian package would fail to uninstall if the
broker was not running. That is the problem you are running into. The
workaround is to ensure that the broker is running when you uninstall or
upgrade.

You will not run into the same problem when upgrading after version
2.8.3, which is what the fix provides. The released fix does not apply
to version 2.8.2 retro-actively.

First of all, this is more of an erlang question than a RabbitMQ one -
not that this changes anything, but you could ask about it in
erlang-questions as well. RabbitMQ clusters are mnesia clusters, so
they offer the same guarantees.

I can't think of a motivation of why this would be happening, but I'm
no expert with mnesia. I've attached a script that reproduces your
test, can you verify that that's more or less what you're doing? I'm
using the puka python client to publish the messages. I've run it 50
times but I wasn't able to reproduce your problem.

In the case that my test is indeed accurate I think that the best
thing is to ask about someone with more mnesia knowledge - I have CCed
possible candidates :).

Francesco.

Hi,

What is the reason for the google groups mailing list?

Many people get confused an posts there, then messages don't arrive in time
and  conversations get lost.

Any chance we could just stick with the
rabbitmq-discuss at lists.rabbitmq.commailing list?

Regards

Alvaro

Thanks Francesco.

Your script looks reasonably close to what I'm doing, except for a couple
of key differences:

All of your nodes are running on the same host. In my setup, each node is
in its own VM. I imagine this introduces additional networking into the
communication between nodes.

When you start Rabbit instances, you're doing it sequentially. In my setup
I start up in parallel on all three VMs via Capistrano. If you can't go the
multi-VM route, you may be able to somewhat simulate this by starting the
instances with an '&' at the end.

I use "killall -9 beam.smp", rather than just "killall beam.smp"


In short, the goal of my test is to simulate a worst case powerout in the
datacenter. All of our Rabbit instances run on separate VMs for fault
tolerance. Hopefully we won't lose them all at once, but if we do, we need
to be able to reliably restart them.

Hi,

The bug was fixed as issue #77:
  https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/77

I just released an updated version of SockJS-client, with this
bug fixed (sockjs-client 0.3.2):
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sockjs/VckHUbOzBTM/18WpcQNTh2QJ


I hope that will solve this problem.

Cheers,

Yeah. I'm on my laptop these days, so if anything I'll a VM setup on
Monday.

Well, I'm forking them one after the other and then waiting for them
to actually start, so is not that sequential. I doubt that matters.

> I use "killall -9 beam.smp", rather than just "killall beam.smp"

Right. This should not make much of a difference either. I tried with
-9 and things were OK.

As a curiosity, how are you waiting to be sure that the messages are
persisted? I am using publisher confirms, see
http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html - that's why puka and not pika
- but you need to make sure of that, otherwise you can get message
loss or other strange behaviours.

If you are trying to simulate what happens when the system crashes
while sending messages, then it's different and of course you can't
rely on any of the messages in being there when you restart them - but
that does not justify the behaviour you're seeing anyway.

Francesco.

Wow, great turnaround time. Thanks!

I'm using transactions.

For what it's worth, this hang on broker start is happening much less than
10% of the time. It happened twice in 10 minutes one day, and the next day
didn't happen at all.

For what it's worth, I now have Mnesia logging enabled so that if/when it
does repro again, I'll have more details.

I solve the problem... his happens when I call *rabbitmq-server
-detached ,*the
*rabbitmq-server.bat *  was modified causing the problem:

I Change

*if "!RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_DIR!"=="" ( *
*    set RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_DIR=!TDP0!..\plugins *
*)*

to

*set RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_DIR=!TDP0!..\plugins*

Equals to 2.8.2 version.

Thanks,

You probably already know this, but confirms are *much* faster if
that's the only thing you're doing - not that it matters here, but it

Ok. Please post the relevant logs when you can reproduce the problem.

	1.0.0.pre1
Message-ID: <4A239BA3-3516-4E9D-9F88-E0D68BB7DA90@gmail.com>

amqp gem 0.9.5 is released to rubygems.org [1]. This is a bug fix release:

 * Channel prefetch (basic.qos) setting is no longer ignored by the automatic recovery mode
 * Fixes an off-by-one issue with framing that current RabbitMQ releases are forgiving about  but future versions will no longer be.

I highly encourage all users to upgrade and be well prepared for upcoming RabbitMQ releases.

In addition, there are some changes in master that did not make it to 0.9.5. I released them off master as 1.0.0.pre1 [2] and they will be backported and released in 0.9.6 in a few days:

  * Support for the consumer cancellation notification extension
  * More correct reporting of client capabilities
  * Only check :type, :durable, :arguments parameters if an exchange is redeclared (per 0.9.1 spec)
  * Only check :exclusive, :durable, :auto_delete, :arguments parameters if a queue is redeclared (per 0.9.1 spec)

If you need any of those as a gem, use 1.0.0.pre1.

Big props to contributors and people who keep discovering issues and improving documentation at rubyamqp.info:

* Richard Heycock
* Matt Weyant
* Katrina Owen
* Elias Levy
* Matthias Radestock

Happy Friday.

Yes, I know, and Erlang on Debian Squeeze is R14.
It's 14A on Debian, but Ubuntu has 14B.. I don't know if that's significant?

I'm a bit confused. Does this problem manifest when you call 
rabbitmq-server.bat *without* passing -detached?

Hi, 


I am using txAMQP and rabbitMQ for RPC calls. However, I'm having a problem with this currently where the client side sends the following message twice: 


<Content instance: body='hi', children=[], properties={'correlation id': 'f1237252-4e5f-40f5-a0fc-b7151d063652', 'reply to': 'amq.gen-QInOd8SxMovrJa8PODvt43'}> 


and then the server side receives hundreds of messages at that point all just "None". I can use this script with just a single client and server at a time and it works fine so I'm not sure what's wrong with it... 


Thanks, 
Devin

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Publishing delay when process is active
Message-ID: <5204bae6-015c-4465-95b1-aa3652d35b79@googlegroups.com>

I have a daemon process which uses a Tornado IO loop for event processing 
and the pika/TornadoConnection class
for interacting with Rabbit.

My processing loop looks like:

  -wait to receive a Rabbit message (ioloop.start())
  -on message:
    - loop
       - do some work
       - publish a status message (like "work item #1 complete")

My problem is that in the case there is lots of work to do, then messages 
published inside the "do some work"
loop don't seem to get sent until processing is finished and returns 
to the ioloop. Is there some way to make those messages be published 
immediately, like a flush? Or is there
a different pattern I should use to ensure timely publishing?

thanks

I just tried running it on R14A and it failed with the same error.

I'm afraid the simplest workaround is to upgrade erlang R14B.

There's the headers exchange, see page 28 of

http://www.rabbitmq.com/resources/specs/amqp0-9-1.pdf

Was that what you were looking for?

We were able to identify the problem. It'll be fixed on the next release.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] erlang client logging macros issue
Message-ID: <4FE44198.8000406@gmail.com>

Hello!

I've got an issue with Erlang client library. For some reason client
header file defines several LOG_* macros.

http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-erlang-client/file/53620e911d13/include/amqp_client.hrl#l65

Since these names of logging macros are popular (I think many
applications define something like LOG_INFO) they came into conflict
with macros in my application.

Is it possible to hide this LOG_* macros from amqp_client.hrl to some
private header that won't be included in external applications?

Regards,
Anton Lebedevich.

first. You need to build in the right order (although
http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html claims that you can just cd
into a plugin sub-directory and build, so I'll validate that and update
either the documentation of this thread, depending on which is correct). I
did

 

% hg clone <path>

% cd rabbitmq-public-umbrella

% make checkout

% make all

 

Now in answer to your question 'Which file path he is asking to exists'
[sic] - the answer is right in front of you!  The output says "can't find
include lib "rabbit_common/include/rabbit.hrl" so that is the file which is
missing! I will admit this is a bit opaque as the rabbit_common library is
built from the rabbitmq-erlang-client sources, which I'll admit is confusing
at first. Anyway, by the looks of things you're probably doing one of two
things wrong, either

 

1. you've forgotten to run make checkout (or it hasn't run properly) or...

2. you're building from the wrong directory or....

3. some other strange thing is happening that I can't replicate at the
moment

Cygwin now, which is great. I do keep a windows environment around for
testing, but it's not configured for building and from speaking to a
colleague who *has* tried building on Windows, there are going to be
numerous other gotchas down the line. We are 'all hands on deck' at the
moment so I cannot promise when (or even if) I will have time to install
Cygwin (etc) in a Windows environment and figure out what steps are causing
you these issues. 

 

If I were in your shoes, I would make my life a lot easier (and progress a
lot faster) and install linux on a virtual machine and use that instead. You
will have a *lot* less headaches doing that and the installation of Erlang
and everything else is *very* well documented on the internet.

 

Cheers,

Tim

Line 23 is where it's trying to write build/deps.mk. Check your permissions.

Hmm. Well, there was a real issue there. That one was where the 
management plugin was getting desynchronised from what was really going 
on. So if you are still seeing something similar in 2.8.2, does 
management agree with rabbitmqctl?

(In general rabbitmqctl goes and calls into processes whenever it needs 
to know something, while management listens to events that are broadcast 
and maintains its own view of the world.)

Cheers, Simon

Hi Simon,

That's it! You know how I do it with .NET client? The .NET client has
support to "Headers Exchange"?

Thanks,

I can see that you removed the offending space at the end of that line.
The trailing space in the assignment caused the error. The fix for this
will be in a future release.

It does - you can declare a headers exchange by
IModel.ExchangeDeclare(), with "headers" as the exchange type parameter.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Moving on
Message-ID: <20120622124110.GA31802@wellquite.org>

As some of you will have noticed, over the last few months, my
contributions to RabbitMQ have decreased fairly sharply. I have been
busying myself with other projects (eg AtomizeJS) and have only really
returned to work on Rabbit to help with knowledge transfer
(active/active HA systems) and other issues that interest me (eg the
Codel AQM experiments). Even that though is now at an end.

Whilst I am staying with VMware, I'm now officially moving on from
working with RabbitMQ to pastures new.

I first started work on RabbitMQ in the summer of 2006 and whilst there
were about 2.5 years in which I did various bits of a PhD and didn't
have anything to do with Rabbit during that time, I've nevertheless been
involved in Rabbit on and off for the last 6 years. When I returned to
LShift early spring 2009, Rabbit was a very much more primitive beast
than it is today - it couldn't hold more messages than could fit in RAM,
there were no plugins, we didn't implement the whole of AMQP 0-8, let
alone 0-9-1, there was no form of HA at all, etc etc. I am very grateful
to have had the opportunity to work on many of those areas and help the
community and guide the direction of Rabbit.

Obviously, Rabbit is in very good hands going forwards, not just with
the remaining members of the original team that came, along with myself,
to VMware from LShift, but with additional recruits, and of course with
the community that has, through bug reports, the creation of many
clients and applications, and through publicity in the form of blog
posts, books, and tweets, helped so much with Rabbit's growth and
continuing popularity.

Thank you, one and all.

Matthew

Number of processes is growing all the time even though no messages are not

All publishers has been blocked. After some time I killed the
publisher processes, but RabbitMQ still sees them as connected and blocked.

mkiedys at arch-task-mq-8:/var/log/rabbitmq$ cat
rabbit at arch-task-mq-8.log|grep vm_memory_high|wc -l
2935

Why does the server consumes more memory than 1.6GB limit?

Hi Micha?.

This is quite vague - if we can't see the source of your test tool it's 
hard to see what it's actually doing.

The server can use more memory than the high watermark; that's just the 
point at which it stops accepting new messages from the network. This 
should greatly cut the extent to which it can consume more memory, but 
will not eliminate it.

There is an existing issue where the processes used by connections do 
not close when the connection is closed and memory use is above the 
watermark. When the memory use drops the processes will go. Could your 
test application be opening new connections?

Also, you say:

> The readers has been disconnected by the server ahead of time.

does this mean that huge numbers of messages are building up in the 
server? Note that in the default configuration there is a per-message 
cost in memory of a hundred bytes or so even when the message has been 
paged out to disc, so that might explain why so much memory is being used.

I hope this helps explain what you are seeing. But I'm not exactly sure 
what you are doing...

Cheers, Simon

Nothing to do with us, I'm afraid. We have no idea who set it up or is 
looking after it. And there is no way of finding out who the owner is or 
even just contacting them (thanks, google!).

Incidentally, if anyone reading this did set it up, do please get in

You should consider using the more recent active-active mirrored queues 
(http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html) instead of active-passive HA with 
corosync et al.

If you are part of that group you can at least list members by join date: 

https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!members/rabbitmq-discuss%7Cjoindate

Maybe that would help finding out who created it?

yes, pretty much useless. But if this group is not official you can at least report the group.

Google groups is a good reader, when it works.

But I found out quickly that anything posted there doesn't find its way to
the mailing list. I wonder if there's a way to make it read-only.

There probably is. If we were the owners.

Reporting the group for abuse seems a bit draconian.

I've found the email address of the original creator. 

I'll sent it over to Matthias and Simon via private. You can reach it if you switch back to the old google groups

I tried to contact this person back in 2009.  He did not reply.  I
tried to get Google to help but they didn't seem to want to.

If he's not replying, just shut it down. Hardly seems he has a vested
interest in running a group anymore, in that case :)

I tried reporting the group, you can't provide a reason so I canceled.

IIRC, Google said they couldn't do anything without the group
creator's permission.  But that was nearly 4 years ago, and it's worth
trying again to get their help.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] librabbitmq-c and amqp_channel_close
Message-ID: <4FE49313.8030407@seegrid.com>

Hi,

We've been using librabbitmq-c on our robots for the past several months 
with a fair amount of success (we last synced to the repository on May 
10th).  However, we're very occasionally seeing amqp_channel_close take 
over 3 seconds to complete, when connected to an RMQ server on the same 
machine via the loopback (127.0.0.1) interface.  I haven't been able to 
reproduce it reliably, but it happens in production about once a day, 
and our logging is pretty conclusive that this call is the culprit:

   amqp_channel_close ( m_Conn, subscriptionId, AMQP_REPLY_SUCCESS );

There don't appear to be any relevant messages in the RMQ server log.  I 
had hoped to have a self-contained, reproducible example before posting, 
but no dice so far.

Has anyone run into this before?  Any suggestions on how to debug it 
further?  I've recently instrumented amqp_simple_rpc, but haven't had an 
occurrence since I did so.

Thanks,

-Brennan

Closing a channel is a synchronous operation, the completion of which 
provides various guarantees on resource reclamation (e.g. exclusive 
queues get deleted, etc). Depending on what operations were performed on 
that channel prior to closure a fair amount of tidying up / cleaning up 
might take place, some of which involves taking (the equivalent) of 
exclusive write logs on server-wide shared data structures, doing 
fsyncs, etc.

So what you are seeing may not be unusual.

Matthias.

Ah, that makes sense -- and if it's I/O bound, it may explain why I 
haven't been able to reproduce it on my test machine.  I don't suppose 
there's an equivalent async method?  I'm not seeing anything obvious in 
the source....  I'm leery about threading it off, given librabbitmq-c's 
lack of thread safety.

This is happening as a client is unsubscribing from a queue (and closing 
the associated channel), so we won't be trying to touch the channel 
again (obviously).  Architecturally, it seems like there's no reason to 
wait on the client side for it to complete.

It's only an issue because the unsubscribe is occurring at the end of a 
query-response cycle, and is delaying the return of data to the 
requester (yeah, I know, pub/sub is generally better, but rewriting 
legacy procedural/synchronous code to be event-driven is a slow 
process).  We won't be doing anything else with the channel, so if we 
could tell the server we don't need a response, I'd be happy.

Failing that, any thoughts on what can be done server-side to speed up 
the process?  Do durable queues/exchanges exacerbate the problem?

Thanks much,

-Brennan

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] IMPORTANT: serious bug in RabbitMQ 2.8.3 -
	please upgrade *now*
Message-ID: <4FE4A2C2.1070100@rabbitmq.com>

We've found an unpleasant bug in RabbitMQ 2.8.3 which can cause log 
rotation to trigger a state where the log file grows rapidly and without 
end, eventually exhausting all available disk space.

If you are running RabbitMQ 2.8.3 you are strongly advised to upgrade to 
2.8.4 immediately and in the meantime do not invoke "rabbitmqctl 
rotate_logs". This applies particularly strongly to users of the RPM and 
.deb packages, since these are configured to rotate logs automatically.

Other versions of RabbitMQ are not affected by this bug.

This release also fixes an issue activating plugins on Windows. See the 
attached release notes for more details.

The new release can be downloaded from:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion
list.

Regards,
                       The RabbitMQ Team

You could just not wait for the close-ok :) That would be quite hard in 
most AMQP client libraries, but perhaps it's possible in librabbitmq.

Also, if you are intending to close the connection too, then *just* do 
that, rather than closing all the channels first. It's semantically 
equivalent(ish).

And in that case, if you really don't care about the various guarantees 
provided by the handshake, you could simply close the socket instead, 
i.e. don't bother with any of the closing handshake. That is not really 
recommended though.

Yes.

Thanks Simon.

I realized just now that I was less than precise in my prior summary of the
state.

It does appear that that rabbitmqctl and the management API are in sync on
what they report. What's "interesting" is that after the broker rejoins the
cluster, it's not always a slave for the queues it was previously a master
or slave for.

If you'll recall from my original message, we normally have 3 brokers.
During the rolling upgrade we take one down and then rejoin it to the
cluster. What we're seeing is that after the broker rejoins, some of the
queues have the expected two slaves ('+2' in the UI). However, other queues
(seemingly at random) have only one slave ('+1').

The management UI and rabbitmqctl agree on what we're seeing. And prior to
the operation, all the queues had two slaves.

Okay, thanks much for the feedback!  We're not closing the whole 
connection, so we can't take one of the more scorched-earth approaches: 
we use a channel per subscription to keep a protocol error on one from 
taking down everyone, and the problem arose in the unsubscribing code.

In case it's useful to anyone else, I added the below to amqp_api.c 
(with the appropriate prototype in amqp.h).  It's a Frankenstein of the 
relevant bits of amqp_channel_close and amqp_simple_rpc, and could 
probably be cleaned up a bit / refactored, but this is the minimal diff 
against the existing library.  It seems to work, but only time will 
tell, since the original bug wasn't reliably reproducible.

Thanks for the help,

-Brennan

Message-ID: <8858E157-3AA7-4B1E-A098-D355FD2BE9C8@gmail.com>

amqp gem 0.9.6 is released to rubygems.org [1]. This is a bug fix release that
backports a few more fixes and improvements in the master (1.0.0.pre series) to 0.9.x:

 * Support for the consumer cancellation notification extension
 * More correct reporting of client capabilities
 * Only check :type, :durable, :arguments parameters if an exchange is redeclared (per 0.9.1 spec)
 * Only check :exclusive, :durable, :auto_delete, :arguments parameters if a queue is redeclared (per 0.9.1 spec)

As usual, I encourage all users to upgrade.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Important: the future of Bunny (a Ruby RabbitMQ
	client)
Message-ID: <84B5E519-1F66-4F0A-BA1D-7087973423ED@gmail.com>

First, a little announcement: I released Bunny 0.8.0 to rubygems.org [1]. This release
is identical to 0.7.9 and will be used as a mark for the last release of Bunny that implements AMQP 0.8.

Now, to the fun part.

Bunny is a library with complicated history: it is old, very feature incomplete, not maintained, has odd API decisions, has
no documentation and is stuck at AMQP 0.8. In addition, it does not frame message bodies, which means with
future RabbitMQ versions it will not be possible to send messages larger than the size of one frame (typically 128K).

Over the years nobody took over Bunny's maintainership, resulting in a crazy number of forks each fixing an issue or
two in a very ad-hoc manner. Sometimes this involved copying some amqp gem code in a haste to support URI connections
for Heroku. Sometimes it involved reinventing half of what's already available in the amq-protocol gem just to get
array and map (attribute tables) serialization in message headers.

Needless to say, this is not a healthy situation for a library to be in.

At the same time, Bunny is popular and I can see why certain people, companies and users cannot move to Hot Bunnies (which is JRuby-only) or deal with EventMachine that amqp gem uses. There are popular PaaS providers that use
Bunny in their doc examples because of the simplicity. OpsCode Chef still seems to depend on Bunny. And the list goes on.

This cannot go on forever. At some point, projects that rely on Bunny with either get stuck with old RabbitMQ versions
or will simply break. Both options really suck.

So I decided to do to Bunny what we did to amqp gem in 2010 and 2011: rewrite it from scratch, make it feature complete
and keep it backwards compatible where possible, but within reason. It worked well for amqp gem and besides
Ruby 1.8.7-p249 users (amqp gem does not support that particular patch level because it has a serious bug that would
require rewriting half of the library to work around), all non-trivial codebases that use amqp gem eventually upgraded to 0.8.x and now 0.9.x with very little or no effort.

Some highlights of what I have in mind:

* Move to AMQP 0.9.1, use amq-protocol that is a standalone library with pretty good test coverage, no I/O parts (only pure functions) and which is based on rabbitmq-codegen, a tool that official clients suck as the Java one use.
* Rewrite Bunny's test suite which is, hm, not particularly complete
* Make Bunny as feature complete as amqp gem and Hot Bunnies
* Provide lower-level, non-OO (AMQP is not OO, as are most of network protocols) client
* Deprecate but not remove oddities current Bunny API has
* Avoid race conditions and other known fundamental problems Bunny has thanks to the way it implements network communication

I am not sure what to do about the docs yet. Porting rubyamqp.info guides for Bunny is definitely not as much work as it
took to write them but it almost certainly will take a month or more. I may or may not be motivated enough to do that.

The fun starts on July 1st when I go on a vacation.


A short FAQ for Bunny users:

** Who are you? Why should I trust you to make sweeping changes to Bunny? Our CTO wants to know!

I main amqp gem, Langohr (a Clojure client), co-maintain Hot Bunnies with Theo Hultberg and have been using and
digging in internals of the Java client on and off for a few years.

On top of that, I wrote all doc guides at http://rubyamqp.info/. Chris Duncan, the original author of Bunny, helped me with editing them.

In other words, I am pretty qualified to design and write an AMQP 0.9.1 client, in any language.
Possibly even more qualified than your CTO.


** Will my code break?

We will do our best to break as little as possible. It is doable, as amqp gem experience shows.


** Why do I need AMQP 0.9.1?

AMQP 0.8 may or may not be around after a few RabbitMQ releases. Regardless of the exact version, the
goal is to make Bunny feature complete and all reasonably well maintained RabbitMQ clients have moved on to
AMQP 0.9.1.

In addition, you will be able to use RabbitMQ extensions to AMQP 0.9.1. Some of them are very powerful.


** Do you even realize why Bunny users use Bunny?

Yes. Because of the simplicity. We will make sure to preserve this nice aspect of Bunny, don't worry.


** Will you use EventMachine?

No, absolutely not. I am as tired of jumping through the hoops to not block the event loop as you are.
We will use that old boring TCP sockets thing.

It is highly unlikely that this is a server misbehaviour; more likely 
it's a problem with the application code or client library.

I suggest you deploy one of Rabbit's tracing facilities - 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#tracer, or 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/firehose.html (and 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2011/09/09/rabbitmq-tracing-a-ui-for-the-firehose/ 
- this plugin ships with the server these days, so you just need to 
enable it)  - to get an idea of the client/server interactions taking place.

Regards,

Matthias.

Message-ID: <3F0F6E0A-D72D-4133-A7BF-4431DD45D610@gmail.com>

Yesterday in the Bunny 0.8.0 release announcement I've stated that 0.8.0 is the last release to support AMQP 0.8.
This is not correct: 0.7.9 is the last release. 0.8.0 already only supports AMQP 0.9.1.

This means Bunny 0.8.0 requires RabbitMQ 2.0 and later. We will update the README to say so
very soon.

Hi,
   I have some little experience with RabbitMQ in Java/Android though I am 
new to C++ in RabbitMQ. I am trying to run some code from 
http://code.google.com/p/rabbitcpp/. Though  MSVC gives "amqp_faming.h: no

Steps I have done:
1. Install MinGW
2. Install Python
3. bash-3.1$ etc/build-ms.sh (works fine)
4. Include "amqp\dist" and "librabbitmq\" into external path

though I am not sure how to do : "C:>bash bash-3.1$ mount 'C:\mingw' 
/mingw" and what to do with codegen.

Are there any tutorials for C++ (like Java)?

Somewhat obvious question: is amqp_framing.h in one of those two
directories you set as an include?

If you're building rabbitmq-c on Win32 (doesn't matter which version) I
would highly recommend using the CMake-based build to build it correctly.

Hi Alan,
         I was able to use CMAKE (where source code: librabbitmq and build
binaries: my project folder). These are the errors I get, and also there is
visual studio file "ALL BUILD" when I try running that it gives me:* "Error
copying file "/amqp_codegen.py" to "C:/Users/kamran/Documents/Visual Studio
2010/Projects/AMQP2/amqp_codegen.py"."*

Sorry for being a newbie.

Though compiler is not showing amqp_framing error.

Did you follow the directions in the README.md (
https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c/blob/master/README.md)?

I suspect you didn't do the git submodule init and git submodule update
steps (which is why you get the Error copying file /amqp_codegen.py error)

The unresolved externals look like they're from rabbitcpp.  You sure you're
linking your executable with the rabbitcpp library?

Will you have builds for the new version of RabbitMQ too?

PS. I tried building rabbitmq-web-stomp myself, but it depends upon 
"cowboy-wrapper" and "sockjs-erlang-wrapper", neither of which I could 
find in the wild.

PPS. I managed to make my own wrappers for those modules, and thus build 
everything from source for 2.8.4.. and rabbitmq starts up and lets 
clients connect to the web-stomp port... but now no messages actually 
get transmitted between the sender and receiver.

The existing build should work just fine; the code hasn't changed.

As above, the existing builds should work.

If you want to build from source, you can find all required plug-ins in 
our hg repo. Just follow the generic plugin build instructions at 
instructions at 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html#getting-started.

Regards,

Matthias.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] What can I do about this ioloop error and
 subsequent write buffer exceeded warnings?
Message-ID: <bc75d70e-d0d1-4626-8a0b-de6eb8c6ec77@googlegroups.com>

I have a server script running three threads. One main thread with the 
inner core of the server instance, and then one receiver thread, and one 
sender thread. The receiver thread has one asynchronous pika connection 
receiving messages, and the sender thread has another asynchronous pika 
connection sending messages. This server instance is running just fine, but 
here and there this error pops up, and after the error comes write buffer 
exceeded warnings. At this point I simply restart the server script and 
everything is fine again.

How can I track this issue down? It's not easy to replicate, usually it 
happens every second day or so. I guess the question is actually two fold. 
First, looking in the base_connection.py file on line 106, it seems that 
the error variable passed to the _handle_error is None which makes it 
problematic to get the error_code. At this point in the code it seems odd 
for error to be None, but on line 137 error has a default value of None. So 
the first thing is to try to figure out whether the error is a proper 
error, or if it's just a bug somewhere in the event handling. Second, if it 
turns out to be a proper error, how can I debug to see which message / 
event triggered the error? Is there any way that I can see inspect the 
traffic to try to find the bad message / event?

Hi Matthias,
I did follow those instructions, and checked out the public-umbrella 
repo -- however it didn't include the cowboy-wrapper or sockjs-wrapper 
plugins, and I'm not familiar with Mercurial.

Were they in a separate repository?

(However, I'll try running with the old builds if that does actually 
work.. I thought there was some kind of version-checking that would 
prevent it)

thanks,
Toby

Ah yes, that's because they are not officially released yet. You'll need 
to clone them manually inside the public umbrella, i.e.

$ cd rabbitmq-public-umbrella
$ hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/cowboy-wrapper
$ hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/sockjs-erlang-wrapper

During startup the broker issues warnings for undefined functions, which 
is what you'd typically get when internal APIs have changed in 
incompatible ways or when running against too old an Erlang. There are 
no version checks.

Kamran;

Lets keep this on the rabbitmq-discuss list so that others may benefit from
this exchange

I think you're still trying to use the autotools build system. The
recommended way to build rabbitmq-c on Windows is using the CMake build
system.

Here is the complete rundown on commands I'd use to build rabbitmq-c:

git clone https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c
cd rabbitmq-c
git submodule init
git submodule update
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake-gui ..  ; This will pop up the CMake gui. Click the configure button,
select the toolchain you're using, then click generate when its finished
configuring - rabbitmq-c should compile with most toolchains (MSVC, MinGW),
you can also use the cmake command directly if you understand how this
works.

At this point you'll have makefiles or visual studio solution/project
files. If you're using makefiles you can make them with the appropriate
makefile processor (nmake or gmake), if you're using visual studio, you can
open the solution file then build using the ALL_BUILD project.

Hi all,

I Have a situation where I need add and remove a queue bind dinamically.
The cliente decides the header property to match. I need know which binds
exists to decide if I need remove or add a bind.

How can I do this with .NET client?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Ending a computation when the queue runs out of
	items
Message-ID: <00b889dc-fcb0-4d63-9569-73b33985be5f@e37g2000yqn.googlegroups.com>

Hi,

I'm wanted to use rabbitMQ in a simple scheme to multithread a
computation in python and I'm having an architecture problem. I wanted
to have a process filling the queue and a another that threw a few
threads consuming it. Than I wanter the following to happen: when the
process that fills the queue is done and the queue is empty again,
each of the threads should stop.

What I've done to this point is this: (code here: https://gist.github.com/2988023)

I have three classes (I'm using pika):
    (a) Populator that has a 'send' method that sends serialized
objects to the queue
    (b) Consumer that has a 'setup' method where I define a function
that will process each item with the basic_consume() method from the
pika channel and a method 'run' that calls the start_consuming()
method from the channel.
    (c) ConsumerPool that creates a few Consumers and a few Threads,
each Thread calling the run method from one of the consumers.

It works quite fine if I expect that my queue will be constantly
filled with stuff. But this is not what I'm expecting: I want the
process to stop when I run out of items and I don't quite see how I
can do it. I tried to call stop_consuming() but I don't think I
actually understand when or how to call it. I must stop the Threads as
well it seems.

Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks!

Hi Alan,
             Thanks a lot for the help. Though I faced one error which was
during cmake related to python and simplejson. For that we can install
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools and in command prompt

$C:/python/scripts/easy_install simplejson

Thanks Again!

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Sequential processing for groups of messages
 with a multi-consumer setup
Message-ID: <017ea8dc-764f-4bb7-abee-8a824d925d1a@googlegroups.com>

Hi,

I am considering RabbitMQ for a project with the following requirement and 
wanted to get some feedback since I am relatively new to message queuing:

To start, I have a queue with a number of consumers assigned for concurrent 
processing. The messages published to a queue will represent tickets coming 
from a ticketing system and some may be associated with the same ticket 
(e.g. same ticket number on different messages in the queue). The problem 
is that I can only consume (work on) a single message belonging to a given 
ticket at a time to avoid external concurrency issues. In other words, if 
consumer A is working on a message representing ticket 1 and, at the same 
time, consumer B is available and is assigned the next message from the 
queue that also represents ticket 1, we have a problem.

So far I am considering two possible options:

1. Dynamically create a temp queue per new unique ticket that arrives, and 
in effect sort messages into their own queues by ticket number. The problem 
with this (if even possible) is how to manage consumers for the temp 
queues. If I assign a single consumer to each queue, the system does not 
scale, if I assign a consumer to multiple queues I am back to the original 
problem.

2.Keep a single queue with multiple consumers assigned and implement a 
cache to track ticket numbers currently being processed. When a consumer 
receives a new message, it first checks the cache to see if a given ticket 
is already being processed. If so, re-queue the message, otherwise add to 
cache.

I am leaning towards option 2 but appreciate any feedback and wisdom from 
the community (perhaps I am missing something obvious).

Thank you,

-Ed

Hi Max,

The problem is that you have only *one* queue.

"Fanout" not telling an exchange to distribute messages to different 
consumers, but to different queues. So, you need at least two queues 
binding to a "fanout" exchange. Then let your two consumers get message 
from those two queues, one consumer to one queue.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Exchange design to use such that messages sent
 does not route back?
Message-ID: <CANJ_2Y5zVgMHUfuz=Lh7Bwmvp=VC5Jc=fRi5UwNXFRRmsT_bwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Some background, currently I am using rabbitMQ as a broker in direct
mode between applications.

There is X number of applications running at 1 time all binding to the
same exchange and send out messages with a routing key.

e.g App A will publish message with key "111" and App B, C, D will
receive the messages A sent. Similarly B, also publish with "111" and
A ,C,D will receive the message etc.

However I noticed a problem with my design as App A will also receive
back the message it sent as it consume with the same key. Is there a
way to configure such that messages sent out does not route back to
the same application? Thanks

Regards,
Tang

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Handling consumer cancellation notifications
Message-ID: <1b8a85d7-7fad-4916-9ec3-aea3562058d4@googlegroups.com>

Hi,

We have followed the instructions in http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html to 
setup an active-active cluster with 3 nodes rabbit1, rabbit2 and rabbit3.
To create a mirrored queue, we are using x-ha-policy and to get consumer 
cancellation notifications we have put true for consumer_cancel_notify in 
clientProperties.
Now, we published messages to the queue with rabbit2 as master and had the 
consumer consume from  rabbit3. When rabbit2 is stopped, the consumer 
connected to rabbit3 is not getting a cancellation notification.

We are using rabbitmq 2.8.2-1 and our java consumer POC code is here - 
https://gist.github.com/2990146

Not sure what we are doing wrong. Any pointers would be highly appreciated. 

Has anyone attempted to handle cancel notifications with 
 https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib?


Thanks

Seems you are looking for a "not" semantics in routing key?
That's probably something AMQP could not provide now. Or?
I would love to see if there is a nice work around though.

Both your solutions will work. Another option that I would consider is a
consistent hash exchange, and use the ticket ID as a routing key. That
will allow multiple consumers to process messages associated with
multiple tickets, but the same consumer will always receive messages for
the same tickets.

For more details see
http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-consistent-hash-exchange/file/rabbitmq_v2_8_4/README.md

You would need to put consumer_cancel_notify as true *in a map called 
"capabilities"* in clientProperties.

However, you don't actually need to do this at all, since the Java 
client already sets this for you.

So just remove "factory.setClientProperties(clientProperties);" from 
your example app and it will work.

Cheers, Simon

The assumption AMQP makes is that you will be asserting the existence of 
the objects you require - so that's why queue.bind is idempotent.

The usual reason for wanting to add / remove bindings dynamically is 
that each client wants to get its own set of messages from some 
exchange. So each client declares its own (autodelete or exclusive) 
queue, binds it as needed, and then when the client disconnects the 
queue is deleted, and with it the bindings.

If you need something more complicated than that, you would need to talk 
to the management HTTP API.

Cheers, Simon

I assume you mean "when the queue becomes empty" - obviously there's 
nothing to stop a publisher publishing more work even after a queue has 
been drained.

There's no way to get immediately notified that a queue is empty as a 
client. The best you can do is have your consumer keep redeclaring the 
queue occasionally, and looking at the queue.declare-ok to see how many 
messages the queue claims to have.

This isn't necessarily true, it depends on what he means by 'when it runs out of items',
e.g. the following is sometimes used in Kombu:

import socket
from kombu import Connection, Consumer, Exchange, Queue, eventloop

queue = Queue('q', exchange=Exchange('q'), routing_key='q')

def on_message(body, message):
    print(body)
    message.ack()

def drain_queue(queue, callback):
    with Connection('amqp://guest:guest at localhost://") as connection:
        with Consumer(connection, [queue], callbacks=[callback]):
             try:
                eventloop(limit=None, timeout=1)
             except socket.timeout:
                return  # no more messages
drain_queue(queue)

The important part in the example to keep draining events from the connection
until it raises a timeout.  It will wait for 1 second in this example,
and there are cases where the socket recv times out *even if there
are more messages*, but it works well enough for applications where
this is not important.

(You can also set the timeout to 0.0, but that increases the chance of a false
positive, and you have to catch EAGAIN or EINTR as well).

Tang,

You could add a header property to the message with App A?s signature (different from other apps) then read this back when the message is received and ignore if found.

Simon,

How you said, each client need to get its own set of messages, but I need
which messages survive to client disconnect and the client can change the
binds to filter messages based on headers (Exchange Headers).

Has a way to unbind (using UnbindQueue method in .NET) to Unbind all queue
binds (an wildcard for example)?

Thanks,

Thiago Burgo

Hi,
I'm trying to hack a chef cookbook for rabbit so it can start multiple
rabbitmq instances on the same machine, managed by runit
(http://smarden.org/runit/)

Rabbit startup fairly involved compared to most services - does anyone
have an example of starting rabbit under runit, or managing multiple
rabbit instances on one machine, or any other simplified way to start
and manage rabbit?

Thanks,
RJ

Hi Richard,

If you are familiar with Procfiles/foreman/.env then you can see how I've
setup a 2 node test rig here:
https://github.com/brendanhay/myxi/tree/master/test/nodes

The vars were pilfered from here:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html#define-environment-variables
and here: http://www.rabbitmq.com/relocate.html

You can use the RABBITMQ prefixed env variables to change the respective
node's mnesia dirs and so on by re-exporting them in your runit scripts (or
using the rabbitmq-env.config, which you would also need to export from the
run script).

I use a standard runit service setup (via the standard chef runit cookbook
+ 'runit_service' definition) with the /etc/service/rabbitmq/run script
rendered somewhat as follows:


#!/bin/sh
exec 2>&1

# ulimit and other shenanigans here ..
ulimit -n 102400

# Export all the RABBITMQ prefixed variables here ..
export RABBITMQ_*

# Export the chptst -u user's HOME
export HOME=/var/lib/rabbitmq
cd $HOME

# Boom!
exec chpst -u rabbitmq /usr/local/sbin/rabbitmq-server


Hope that helps,
Brendan

Oh, I see.

Not directly. But you can do what we do in the federation plugin - use 
an intermediate exchange.

So you have a well-known headers exchange. Each client then declares its 
own fanout exchange and a queue. It then binds the queue to the fanout 
exchange, and the fanout exchange to the headers exchange with whatever 
bindings it wants.

Thus far it's just the same as binding directly to the headers exchange. 
Except that if your client deletes the intermediate exchange and 
recreates it, you then have effectively unbound everything.

Cheers, Simon

Ah, right, of course. I am somewhat allergic to timeouts, but this can 
work if you're happy that (no message delivered in n seconds) -> (there 
are no messages).

Or you could combine the two ideas.

Providing you use the ticket ID as the routing key, this can ensure that all messages with the same routing key will end up on the same exchange. You could then create a queue and bind it to the exchange, adding a single consumer. If only one message per unique ticket ID is allowed to proceed at any given time, you'll ensure the semantics that way, but of course if processing takes a long time, you could end up with a backlog on the queue reducing performance.

The parallelism you want therefore, lies in consuming messages as they arrive without blocking delivery of new ones. A consumer per ticket ID makes sense in that situation (I would've thought) and  pairing the consumer thread with a worker (thread) means you don't have to block incoming messages.

Actually on further consideration (and after reading Emile's comments) you might not have to worry about that after all.

This code works now!

I needed the latest pika code, which I got from github.  I originally
installed pika using pip, which got a version from 3/2011.  There have been
tons of commits since then.

Hi,
The bug was fixed as issue #77:
  https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/77
I just released an updated version of SockJS-client, with this
bug fixed (sockjs-client 0.3.2):
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sockjs/VckHUbOzBTM/18WpcQNTh2QJ
I hope that will solve this problem.
Cheers,
   Marek

Hi Derek,

Thanks for sharing your discovery. I get the same problem with you. The 
cookie in user_home is not used by rabbitmqctl.bat, but the cookie under 
"H:" drive is used. I don't know why.

you need to download and install:
1. erlang runtime, e.g. win 7 x64 you need "erlang_runtime_win64_R15B01.exe"
2. rabbitmq server: e.g. rabbitmq-server-2.8.2.exe

To create the client (producer and consumer), you need the rabbitmq client 
for java.

Hi,
The bug was fixed as issue #77:
  https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client/issues/77
I just released an updated version of SockJS-client, with this
bug fixed (sockjs-client 0.3.2):
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sockjs/VckHUbOzBTM/18WpcQNTh2QJ
I hope that will solve this problem.
Cheers,
   Marek

	mq
Message-ID: <002801cd52bb$750d4ba0$5f27e2e0$@esteeadvisors.com>

 

Hi,

 

I am trying to create a Security Plugin for Rabbit MQ. I have written this
erlang code.

 

-module(rabbit-security-plugins).

-include("amqp_client.hrl").

{ok, Connection} =
amqp_connection:start(#amqp_params_network{username=Ankit,
password=cklear123456})

 

 

 

And I am getting this error on make :

 

[shashank.jain at linux_dev rabbitmq-security-plugins]$ make

[elided] generate deps

escript: exception error: no match of right hand side value {error,eacces}

  in function  generate_deps__escript__1340__618493__218775:main/1
(/home/shashank.jain/Desktop/Mercurial/mercurial-2.2.2/rabbitmq-public-umbre
lla/generate_deps, line 23)

  in call from escript:run/2 (escript.erl, line 727)

  in call from escript:start/1 (escript.erl, line 277)

  in call from init:start_it/1

  in call from init:start_em/1

make: *** No rule to make target `build/deps.mk', needed by
`ebin/rabbitmq-security-plugins.beam'.  Stop.

[shashank.jain at linux_dev rabbitmq-security-plugins]$

 



 

Can you please suggest me that what is going wrong. Why I am getting this
error message?

 

Thanks,

Ankit Bhardwaj

Hi Ed,

Here is what i am thinking: 

for option 1, have you tried the RPC style?  take a look at this  
http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-java.html 

for option 2, i think you may need a smart dispatcher between the queue and 
all those consumers. it will consume messages from the queue and then 
dispatch every single message by ticket number to different consumers. The 
dispatcher need to monitor the status of each consumer, like is it busy or 
which ticket is it processing?

My guess would be that the dependency generation crashed because one of
the source files had overly restrictive permissions.

Hi Micha? - please can you keep rabbitmq-discuss on CC?

So as I said, the limit is only the point at which Rabbit stops 
accepting new messages. In the general case this should be enough to 
stop further memory consumption - but in your case it looks like it 
isn't. If you were able to post your test tool in a way that would make 
it easy for us to run, then that might be the easiest way for us to help 
you. At the moment we just don't have enough information.

Cheers, Simon

Dear Simon,

My tool uses company internal libraries, so I can not publish it.
Would you like to get more details of this test to be able to play it on
your own?

Regards,
MK

In the same way as you would do it using the usual RabbitMQ-Stomp.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] [Q] Cluster configuration is not retained by
	node after restart
Message-ID: <954be89db54f644efb3b8a16766ff434@klunky.co.uk>

Hi there,

I installed RabbitMQ server but cannot get one node to retain the 
cluster configuration. Step-by-step account follows for what I did to 
configure these nodes.
Node 1:  rabbit at iuu-7
Nide 2:  rabbit at iuu-8


On both nodes install 2.7.0 - This version as all other environment run 
same version.
# rpm -ivh rabbitmq-server-2.7.0-1.noarch.rpm

Start Node 2 (if not already running)
         # /etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server  start

Shutdown RabbitMQ on Node 2
	# /etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server  stop

Copied the Erlang cookie so that both nodes have the same cookie, or 
else these won't talk with each other
    Copy (Node 1) iuu-7:/var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie to (Node 2) 
iuu-8:/var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
permissions and ownership are : Perms 400 -- Owner rabbitmq:rabbitmq

Start RabbitMQ on Node 2
	# /etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server  start

Verify that each node can communicate with each other:
    On Node 1
         $ rabbitmqctl -n rabbit at iuu-8 status
    On Node 2
         $ rabbitmqctl -n rabbit at iuu-7 status

Reset Node 2 so that it is ready to join the cluster on Node 1
	$ rabbitmqctl stop_app
	$ rabbitmqctl reset

Add the Node 2 to the first node with disc writing enabled on both 
nodes:
         $ rabbitmqctl cluster rabbit at iuu-7 rabbit at iuu-8

Start the app on Node 2
         $ rabbitmqctl start_app

Verify the cluster status on Node 2 and the same on Node 1
         $ rabbitmqctl cluster_status
         Cluster status of node 'rabbit at iuu-8' ...
         [{nodes,[{disc,['rabbit at iuu-8','rabbit at iuu-7']}]},
          {running_nodes,['rabbit at iuu-7','rabbit at iuu-8']}]
         ...done.

next I add a few users, and reboot the server.  Now the cluster is 
disconnection, and I cannot get ot to connnect. Also, the users added 
afore the reboot no longer exist.

It comes up without the cluster information nor the users:
[root at iuu-7 ~]# rabbitmqctl cluster_status
Cluster status of node 'rabbit at iup-7' ...
[{nodes,[{ram,['rabbit at iuu-7']}]},{running_nodes,['rabbit at iuu-7']}]
...done.

[root at iup-8 ~]# rabbitmqctl cluster_status
Cluster status of node 'rabbit at iup-' ...
[{nodes,[{disc,['rabbit at iup-8']},{ram,['rabbit at iup-7']}]},
  {running_nodes,['rabbit at iup-8']}]
...done.

The cluster configuration does not survive a server restart and in this 
case user account was was lost.    I imagine that I have misconfigured 
something.

** The question **
How can I ensure that the cluster reconnects after rabbitmq-server 
restarts, and that data that was written is retained?  Or, what did I 
misconfigure



Many thanks, S.

Hi.

You say you "reboot the server" - is this node 1, node 2, or both?

The description you have after rebooting the server is consistent with 
having one RAM node and one disc node and restarting both of them - in 
2.7.0 if the RAM node came back up first it would create a blank 
database. This was fixed in 2.8.x, in that now a RAM node will refuse to 
start if there are no disc nodes to connect to.

However, when you initially create the cluster you are creating both 
nodes as disc nodes. So I am puzzled as to how you could have got to the 
state where one node was a RAM node. Are you definitely not reclustering 
at any stage?

Cheers, Simon

By "reclustering" I just mean reissuing "rabbitmqctl reset" "rabbitmqctl 
cluster ..." commands, and thus redefining the cluster.

Alternatively, could something be removing files from 
/var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/ ?

Nope, I'm not reissuing the commands.

One part I omitted was that there was an previous install of Rabbit on
the server, but the rpm was removed, and an rm -r /var/lib/rabbitmq/*
was done. The .erlang.cookie was also removed, and I double checked that
the mnesia files were definitely removed afore I did anything.

Huh. Well, that's not good. Do you have logs from when this happens?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] lost messages (.NET)
Message-ID: <1340818001643-20402.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi, i'm new to RabbitMQ, currently trying out some real-world cases. 
The case is:
1) Producer publishes about 10 messages per second.
2) First consumer starts consuming the messages and after some consuming
hangs for a while (Console.ReadLine()) 
3) While the first consumer is hanging second consumer starts to consume the
messages from the same queue (not immidiatly, after n seconds)
4) I kill first consumer, watch logs and what i see is there are some
messages that weren't acknowledged but deleted from the queue and i never
see them.

Here is the code (first consumer):

using (IModel model = connection.CreateModel())
                {
                    var subscription = new Subscription(model, "MyQueue",
false);
                    var i = 0;

                    using (StreamWriter writer =
File.AppendText("C:/RabbitMQlog.txt"))
                    {

                       
writer.WriteLine("============================================");
                        
                        while (true)
                        {

                            i++;
                            BasicDeliverEventArgs basicDeliverEventArgs =
subscription.Next();

                            string messageContent =
Encoding.UTF8.GetString(basicDeliverEventArgs.Body);

                            writer.WriteLine(messageContent);
                            writer.Flush();
                            Console.WriteLine(messageContent);

                            subscription.Ack(basicDeliverEventArgs );

                            if (i == 100)
                                Console.ReadLine();
                        }
                    }
                }

Could anyone help me with this issue?

Rader,

Thank you for the reply. 

I was considering RPC but it is likely to introduce blocking and in this 
scenario it is not important to get a confirmation when a message is 
processed, so async is probably the way to go.

The smart dispatcher idea is interesting, perhaps I can have the dispatcher 
process create/assign temp ticket queues/consumers on the fly to forward 
messages to as needed and that will result in the categorization I am 
looking for.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Working with federation with the rubyamqp client
Message-ID: <ae91c28a-6bfa-4796-a6b0-2ddf1d945e59@googlegroups.com>

Hey,ive set up 2 test rabbitmq servers on one machine,both on different 
ports

one server configures the federation plugin to define the other one as an 
upstream exchange.

after that is done,what do i need to do in order to be able to recieve 
messages from the upstream exchange?
how do i reference the exchange?

if my define exchange is name 'yoni', i tried running channel.topic('yoni', 
:auto_delete => true)
which is the exact same configuration i gave in the federation plugin 
config,and in the server logs i get an erro that i am trying to re-define 
the exchange with different attributes/properties.

on my downstream server,the one that defined the federation plugin,i 
reference the exchange as well,and bind a queue to it with the binding key 
'#' - meaning it should recieve all messages from the exchange,no matter 
which routing key.

And ofcourse no messages are recieved.

Help will be appriciated,

Kindest Regards,

Yoni Gozman

I did the same thing to myself -- as a windows admin, sc delete is a everyday 
tool.

I did this: (sc delete rabbitmq) and now I cannot get RabbitMQ service to 
install again.  The install batch reports "Service is already installed; just 
updating configuration / plugins", but then no service is present.

Removed the %RABBITMQ_BASE%\db folder, removed the %APPDATA%\rabbitmq folder, 
then Uninstall, reboot, reinstall both RabbitMQ and the Erlang package no 
help -- still cannot install the service.

I just removed by hand what little registry stuff that Erlang has after a 
uninstall... I didn't look promising, but we'll see what happens.

Cheers.

Hi, 

I Started again with a fresh installation of 2.7.1.

There
remain errors when I request it to join a cluster. 

There is nothing
recorded in /var/log/rabbitmq/shutdown_err.

I have replaced the server
names with Node1 and Node2 respectivly to make it easier to follow.

Any
ideas?

I tried once more from scratch, and thought

Deleted all the

and rebooted both of the RedHat servers. These are virtual boxes & the
reboot cycle is about 2 mins.

After the servers came back I did this:


# rpm -i rabbit-server....rpm 

Create and add this line into
/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config:
 [{rabbit, [{cluster_nodes,
['rabbit at Node1', 'rabbit at Node2']}]}].

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] [Q] How can one remove dead nodes from a cluster?
Message-ID: <4FEC3FA2.8010300@klunky.co.uk>

Hi there,

    Another Q for today.

    I have a four cluster node where two servers are dead. These were
rebuilt. 
These two were no removed from the cluster, so the two remaining servers
think that the two dead servers are still part of the cluster, but
listed as unavailable.  These two dead nodes were never put in the
rabbitmq.config.


How can one remove dead nodes from a cluster?   I expected a command
list $ rabbitmqctl remove_cluster rabbit at rabbit1 but did not see one.

Cheers, S

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Populate queues in an instance with queues in
	multiple instances
Message-ID: <CACWtv5koNkiRT=mf4gDnkQ3QH423wMYSSuw3EYcrCHc4gMfXxA@mail.gmail.com>

There is a problem that we are trying to deal with queues. I posted the
problem on Stackoverflow and got a very quick response from
Alexis<http://stackoverflow.com/users/1397341/alexis>which does clear
a lot of things but I have a few more questions.

The problem as stated on
Stackoverflow<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11241837/synchronize-one-queue-instance-with-multiple-redis-instances>
:

*The Scenario:*

We have multiple nodes distributed geographically on which we want to have
queues collecting messages for that location. And then we want to send this
collected data from every queue in every node to their corresponding queues
in a central location. In the central node, we will pull out data collected
in the queues (from other nodes), process it and store it persistently.

Constraints:

   - Data is very important to us. Therefore, we have to make sure that we
   are not loosing data in any case.
   - Therefore, we need persistent queues on every node so that even if the
   node goes down for some random reason, when we bring it up we have the
   collected data safe with us and we can send it to the central node where it
   can be processed.
   - Similarly, if the central node goes down, the data must remain at all
   the other nodes so that when the central node comes up we can send all the
   data to the central node for processing.
   - Also, the data on the central node must not get duplicated or stored
   again. That is data collected on one of the nodes should be stored on the
   central nodes only once.
   - The data that we are collecting is very important to us and the order
   of data delivery to the central node is not an issue.

*Our Solution:*

We have considered a couple of solutions out of which I am going to list
down the one that we thought would be the best. A possible solution (in our
opinion) is to use Redis to maintain queues everywhere because Redis
provides persistent storage. Then perhaps have a daemon running on all the
geographically separated nodes which reads the data from the queue and
sends it to the central node. The central node on receiving the data sends
an ACK to the node it received the data from (because data is very
important to us) and then on receiving the ACK, the node deletes the data
from the queue. Of course, there will be timeout period in which the ACK
must be received.

*The Problem:*

The above stated solution (according to us) will work fine but the issue is
that we don't want to implement the whole synchronization protocol by
ourselves for the simple reason that we might be wrong here. We were unable
to find this particular way of synchronization in Redis. So we are open to

Response from Alexis:

You could do this with RabbitMQ by setting up the central node (or cluster
of nodes) to be a consumer of messages from the other nodes, and using the
message acknowledgement feature. This feature means that the central
node(s) can ack delivery, so that other nodes only delete messages after
the ack. See for example:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python.html

---

The response from Alexis actually solves most of our problems. But, there
is one more thing to consider.

*I had stated it as a constraint in the original post that:*
"Also, the data on the central node must not get duplicated or stored
again. That is data collected on one of the nodes should be stored on the
central nodes only once."

How do I ensure this? Consider the scenario in which the ACK does not get
delivered due to network issues (in our scenario). What happens in that
case? The queue still is not aware of the status of the completion of the
work. Does the message in that case get locked? Or does another worker pick
it up? If another worker picks it up, then will we have the same data
worked twice? How do we deal this situation?

Thanks in advance,
Vaidik

Removing dead node from a cluster is quite tricky - this will change
in next releases of rabbit.

The easiest method is to bring up an "impostor" node with the same
note name as the dead one, `force_cluster' it with some nodes that are
still in the cluster, and then reseting it. I hope that works for you.

Rabbit can do other things besides AMQP ACKs to help here.

Well your solution sounds fine, but you're going to have to work around all the potential issues (central node is down, some other node is down, both nodes are up and communicating but the network goes down at some point, etc) by hand. I would posit however, that it takes a long time (i.e., years) to gradually squash out all the little bugs in a complicated piece of high availability, distributed software.

Possibly! :)

> What would be the best way to make it fail safe?
Well if you don't care about performance at all, you can just use a database and standard replication technology, but it's not going to scale (or perform) very nicely. You could also consider a sharded distributed file system, although personally I wouldn't want to go that way as the guarantees probably don't fit what you're trying to do very well.

I would add to that another potential bit of the puzzle. You might also want to look at 'Publisher Confirms' (http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#publishing) - a Rabbit extension to AMQP that solves most of the use cases of transactions, without sacrificing performance. In this model, the broker sends a confirm to the publisher once it has 'taken responsibility for' a message. If you are marking your messages as persistent, then the (central) broker *only* does this once the data has been fsync'ed to disk.

BTW - guaranteeing 'once and only once' delivery in an asynchronous messaging system is a bit far out. I would suggest looking at http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2010-August/008272.html for starters. Anyway, publisher confirms should get you some of the way to what you're looking for I expect.

Well what exactly do you mean by this? If you mean that a 'message' (as identified by its correlation-id) should only be delivered once, then using publisher confirms or acks is the way to go. If you're talking about the actual 'content' of your messages not getting duplicated, then that's *entirely* up to your applications, no matter what synchronisation mechanism you choose. Rabbit will not store duplicate persistent messages, *but* the guarantees about how many times a message is received (or delivered, etc) are somewhat different and none of this says anything about what is 'inside' a message being duplicated or not. To a broker, the contents of a message are just a blob of data.

> How do I ensure this? Consider the scenario in which the ACK does not get delivered due to network issues (in our scenario). What happens in that case? The queue still is not aware of the status of the completion of the work. Does the message in that case get locked? Or does another worker pick it up? If another worker picks it up, then will we have the same data worked twice? How do we deal this situation?

Well you're going to have to handle this yourself regardless of what technology you choose to transfer data across the wire. If you choose to publish from your remote nodes to a central broker, then you *should* resubmit a message if the connection drops before you get a 'confirm-ok' back from the broker. If you're after some kind of 2-phase commit where both parties keep on sending ACKs then I think you're going to end up spending a lot of time trying to deal with potential byzantine failures: even paxos and zab have failure models.

Another thing to consider. If the central node is really acting in the role of a database, and what you want is for the remote nodes to sychronise with it, then there are other options. For shovelling data across a WAN, rabbit provides a 'shovel' plugin that simply forwards all its messages to another broker. To quote http://www.rabbitmq.com/shovel.html:

	"The high level goal of a shovel is to reliably and continually take messages from a queue (a source) in one broker and publish them to exchanges in another broker (a destination).
	 The source queue and destination exchanges can be on the same broker or distinct brokers.
	 A shovel behaves like a well-written client application, which connects to its source and destination, reads and writes messages, and copes with connection failures."

Like federated exchanges (another WAN friendly, highly available and partition tolerant feature), shovel will 'behave itself' and can be configured to use publisher confirms just as a hand written producer would. You can also tweak the properties that get passed on to the destination broker, allowing a client application (such as a house keeper) running against the central broker/cluster to do some intervention if needed.

Using shovel like this is a bit of an esoteric choice - it does not provide the same kind of consistency guarantees that HA (mirror) queues do, but then it's not designed to. And consistency means different things to different people in different contexts. For example, if you simply care about the data getting to the central node eventually, then having shovel use publisher confirms and keep trying to reconnect is the central broker goes down might be 'good enough' for you. If you want to do lots of inter-node coordination, then you probably want to write custom clients (producing and consuming) that will run in both (the central and remote) locations. If you want to avoid delays in delivery, you might even have the shovel fail over and delegate to another (remote) node if/when the central server is not accessible (because network issues between site-a and HQ do not necessarily mean that site-b inaccessible to or from either location!). Just a though.

And you will almost definitely want to set up an HA cluster in your central location, so that you can loose a server and not be dead in the water. Try to bare in mind that a box can actually physically break beyond repair, and under those circumstances you're actually doomed unless you've got clustered replication even in the 'central server' to make the solution available and to prevent data loss.

I'm sure that other, more experienced rabbit-iers will have more useful things to add.

Cheers,
Tim

Hi all,

 

I want to use RabbitMQ client library on IOS development, and I download the
C RabbitMQ client library and drag the library to XCODE to compile, there
are some errors, says: missing some head files. 

 

Does someone have some experience on how to use and compile RabbitMQ client
library on IOS environment? 

 

Many thanks,

Jack

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Causes of server disconnects?
Message-ID: <25b02a2f-9d63-488f-911b-a6c3ab864fe1@googlegroups.com>


I am getting a rather strange issue where the server disconnects, but the 
client still thinks it is connected?

In the server log I get:
=WARNING REPORT==== 28-Jun-2012::03:00:02 ===
exception on TCP connection <0.20778.1021> from 10.10.1.225:58539
connection_closed_abruptly

While looking at TCP/IP view on the client shows that it still thinks the 
connection is established?

Obviosuly when this happens, the client no longer receives messages from 
rabbit.

I am wondering under what circumstances does the server determine that the 
connection is closed? Presumably there was no FIN packet sent from the 
client to the server?

Also, since the client did not detect that the session was closed, I am 
wondering how to deal with the situation from the client?

I don't have any specific experience compiling rabbitmq-c for iOS.  However
I would suggest a start point would be to read the README.md

https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c/blob/master/README.md

And go from there.  I would suggest going down the route of using CMake to
generate an XCode project files, then from within XCode change the projects
to target iOS instead of Mac OS X

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] STOMP 1.1 CONNECT header problem
Message-ID: <jsi3kt$jqc$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hello,

for this CONNECT frame

CONNECT
login:guest
passcode:guest
accept-version:1.1
host:localhost

the RabbitMQ 2.8.4 server responds:

ERROR
message:Bad CONNECT
content-type:text/plain
version:1.0,1.1
content-length:23

And if the client sends 'server' instead of 'host':

CONNECT
login:guest
passcode:guest
accept-version:1.1
server:localhost

the server accepts the connection:

CONNECTED
session:session-API2OcjBv_NK11_v0yuppC
heart-beat:0,0
server:RabbitMQ/2.8.4
version:1.1

The specification says there must be a 'host' header in the CONNECT 
frame: 
http://stomp.github.com/stomp-specification-1.1.html#CONNECT_or_STOMP_Frame

but RabbitMQ expects a 'server' header property instead. Is this a bug?

Regards

You'll need to get both Judy and libevent installed in order to build hstcp. Thanks for pointing this out - we'll think about removing it from the default list of packages. For now I'd suggest removing the hstcp entry from PACKAGE_REPOS in the top level Makefile.

RabbitMQ does *not* expect a 'server' header. The difference in the 
above is purely due to whether a 'host' header was specified or not.

The reason the first attempt fails is that the specified host is not a 
virtual host known to your rabbit. RabbitMQ ships with just one vhost, 
called '/', pre-configured. That's also what is chosen as the default 
when no 'host' header is specified in the CONNECT.

We should document this better. I have filed a bug.

While accepting a CONNECT w/o a 'host' header is technically a violation 
of the STOMP 1.1 spec, I don't think it does any harm and it means we 
can keep the CONNECT handling code version agnostic (STOMP 1.0's CONNECT 
does not have a 'host' header).

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Per-Message TTL on NACK'd messages
Message-ID: <465ea5dd330dcd7f68d88824400bc2e6@mail.gmail.com>

I have a customer who I?m delivering content to via a Message Queue.



The queue has a per-message TTL of one hour. This means that at any given
time they should have around 3000 messages.



A few minutes ago I noticed that they had 90,000 un-acked messages in their
queue. I presume that this is because that a message which has been
delivered and is waiting acknowledgement cannot be ?expired?. That sort of
makes sense.



I notified the customer, they reset something and now they have 90,000
messages ready for delivery.



How should messages behave when they have been NAK?d. Does the clock get
reset every time a message is NAK?d?



This document http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#queue-ttl says that
requeued messages preserve their original expiry time, but does that apply
to NAK?d messages?



If there?s no way for me to prevent messages from building up using a TTL,
is there a way for me to prevent client?s from ack/nak on a particular
queue?



Thanks!

Sorry, just to be clear:

When myMessage was queued it had a TTL of 200,000

Ten seconds later myMessage was delivered to the client it had a remaining
TTL of 190,000.

If the client now NAK's myMessage, does that mean when it's requeued it
regains its initial TTL of 200,000?

Thanks so much!

No. The clock will keep ticking, so to speak. As long as you are using 
RabbitMQ >= 2.7.0.

Aha! That explains this behavior.

No. The clock will keep ticking, so to speak. As long as you are using
RabbitMQ >= 2.7.0.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Shovel configuration for a clustered broker with
 mirrored high-availability queues
Message-ID: <78293bda-8d11-48dc-ba47-4dd8822702f2@googlegroups.com>

I have a question about configuring shovel for my application.  We 
currently have two broker clusters that are separated by a network 
partition; one cluster of two brokers in AWS, and another cluster of two 
brokers in a separate network environment.  The non-AWS cluster is the 
"master", so we want to shovel items from the AWS cluster to the master.

The shovel configuration allows for multiple source brokers, but if I want 
redundant shovels running, how should I set them up?  Should I create a 
shovel in each of the clustered AWS brokers that is configured to connect 
only to the broker its installed on, create a non-mirrored queue for that 
shovel to consume, and bind it only to the local exchange?  Or should I be 
trying to configure each shovel to declare a mirrored queue and connect to 
each broker?  It seems like the latter would cause every message to be 
published twice.

Hi all,
I am facing a weird problem of losing messages, even though I am publishing them as persistent messages with pika.BasicProperties(delivery_mode=2) . Here is the scenario:
I have two RabbitMQ brokers, namely rabbit at vm11 and rabbit at vm22;  these two are have been setup in a cluster configuration as shown below:[{nodes,[{disc,[rabbit at vm11,rabbit at vm22]}]}, {running_nodes,[rabbit at vm22,rabbit at vm11]}]
I have two clients (written using pika.BlockingConnection() ); lets call these clients C1 and N1.1.) C1 creates an unique exchange (exchange name generated using UUID, say 3fe546be8aa341b7b174b29a56e63797).2.) C1 then spawns a thread, say C1-T1, which connects to rabbitmq server and waits for a response on this exchange using channel.start_consuming(). 3.) C1 then sends a message to N1 and in the message provides the name of the exchange (3fe546be8aa341b7b174b29a56e63797) where N1 should send the response.4.) once C1-T1 gets the response, it hands over the response to C1 and dies.
In my current setup I have 100 clients process like C1, i.e. C1, C2 ... C100 and one N1. 
This setup works perfectly fine when RabbitMQ is in a single node setup but when I put it in a cluster setup, it starts to loose the messages. What I mean is that Thread C1-T1 never gets a response and time-outs writing an ERROR in my log file. 
The trouble is I am loosing as many as 50% of the messages.
could someone tell me what could be going wrong.
thanks in advance,-upendra
Some more Details of setup: RabbitMQ Server: 2.8.4Pika Library: 0.9.5OS: Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise)VM11 and VM22: quad-core machines with 8GB RAM
Q.) How do I know message is lost?A.) I performed the following steps:1.) log the message at N1 after successfully publishing it2.) enable trace_on on rabbitMQ server and there too log the messages
What I found that the message was sent by N1, was received by rabbitMQ server and RabbitMQ server reports it to be published on the Excahnge 3fe546be8aa341b7b174b29a56e63797  and never reports it to be delivered.

Does the STOMP plugin handle consumer cancelations when a client is
subscribed to a HA queue, and if so, what does it do?  Does it
automatically restart the subscription?

This is rather unlikely.

Assuming you're using ACK's: a message is only removed after you ACK it.

But it will be only redelivered when  the client dies.

In other words: the message will be redelivered when it is unacked and the
consumer dies / disconnects.

Once that happens the message will be redelivered to other consumers
for a particular queue.

Hi,

The server tells you: the connection was closed abruptly.

The client closed the tcp/ip connection abruptly.

Yes.

Presumably. Use tcpdump or wireshark to figure out who was responsible
for sending the first FIN packet. I bet it was the client, who probably closed
the connection abruptly.

The client should have detected that the connection was broken. If it didn't,
it looks like your peers can't agree wheter the connecition is open or closed.
Please do consider enabling heartbeats.

Hi Francesco ,

    Thank-you for this update.  The dead nodes are in a uat environment
so can likely wait until the next release. Perhaps we can then upgrade
all environment from 2.7.1 to current with this feature.

Does a move from 2.7 to 2.8  on all nodes require just the rpm to be
replaced, or is there any additional configuration due to differences in
releases?   ( Please reply with just search the rabbitmq site if it is
on there and I missed it).

Cheers,S

Hi all,

I am facing a weird problem of losing messages, even though I am publishing 
them as persistent messages with pika.BasicProperties(delivery_mode=2) . 
Here is the scenario:

I have two RabbitMQ brokers, namely rabbit at vm11 and rabbit at vm22;  these two 
are have been setup in a cluster configuration as shown below:

these clients C1 and N1.
1.) C1 creates an unique exchange (exchange name generated using UUID, say

2.) C1 then spawns a thread, say C1-T1, which connects to rabbitmq server 
and waits for a response on this exchange using channel.start_consuming(). 
3.) C1 then sends a message to N1 and in the message proviodes the name of 
the exchange (3fe546be8aa341b7b174b29a56e63797) where N1 should send the

The trouble is I am loosing as high mashy as 50% of the messages.

This could happen if you failed to synchronise the .erlang.cookie files.
This page has diagnostic indicators for the condition:

Did you use the correct name for the .erlang.cookie file in the actual
command? Did you copy it to the correct location? Were the cookie hashes
identical in the startup banners of both nodes?

Did that work for you? Joemon reported success to me after following the

service registry entries.

It will be easier to identify the problem if you post the federation
config and the output of "rabbitmqctl list_exchanges" on the upstream
broker. It may be that you are conflating the federated exchange and the
upstream exchange. Following the example at

http://www.rabbitmq.com/federation.html

should leave you with a working federated setup.

You should override HandleBasicCancel to be notified when a queue is
deleted. A test that illustrates is available in the source:

I wouldn't wait for a release including those changes, that might take
some time.

Yeah, you don't need to do anything else apart from installing the new
version, with some precautions, see

I've filed a bug to get these and other library-internal macros/defines

The Windows installer copies the cookie file over from the Windows
directory (windir) to the profile directory of the user performing the
installation. For a definition see the $PROFILE description in the NSIS
documentation:

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html#4.2.3

I suspect NSIS uses the %USERPROFILE% variable.

This was probably randomly initialised at the first invocation of

Perhaps, if NSIS uses USERPROFILE, and this is different from HOMEDIR
and HOMEPATH. I will file a bug to determine whether that can be improved.

Those links are not meant to point to documentation, but to the actual
HTTP endpoints. You are looking at the file in source control. If you
view the page as it renders from the management & monitoring console,
after you enable this plugin in the broker then the URLs will be correct
endpoints.

Thanks for the reply.

The odd thing about the federation plugin is that the downstream broker, 
which is the 'master' conceptually in my case, has to declare its exchange 
type as 'federation', which means the actual type is based on the upstream 
'slave' exchange.  That feels strange to me, because I don't want the 
master to really care about the upstream exchange - it's sort of optional. 
 If the upstream broker is alive that's great, and I want it to forward 
messages along to the master.  If it's not, or isn't present when the 
master starts, I don't want that to be a problem.

Maybe I'm not understanding federation correctly?  It just struck me as odd 
that the master has to go declaring all of the upstream sources it expects, 
and the other way (with shovel) seemed more natural.

I understand that the sources and destination fields accept a list for the 
purpose of failover.  I could configure a single shovel that consumes from 
either broker in the 'slave' cluster and publishes to either broker on the 
master cluster, but I'm worried about the shovel's host broker failing and 
taking the shovel down.

I see that I misunderstood the federated exchange type - you declare
the backing type when you declare the exchange.  For some reason I
thought the backing type was based on the upstream exchanges.

It's still a little odd to me that the master is responsible for
"pulling" rather than having the upstream brokers push.  If I add new
upstream brokers, do I have to edit the master's configuration and
restart it to consume messages from them?

Hi,

We're trying to debug a rabbitmq crash to prevent it in the future.  Under normal operations, we get no errors but in one instance after a machine's power was pulled, we got a rabbitmq crash upon start up.  The only way to recover from this was to delete the msg_store_persistent and queues directory.  Any suggestions on where to start would be helpful.  The log snippets that seem relevant are below.

Thanks!

Looks like a bug in pika to me, maybe you should open up an issue
at https://github.com/pika/pika/issues

This looks hard to track down indeed, but in general you should probably expect
that such errors can happen, and retry the operation if it does.

pika should raise some connection related error if there is no error code,
so that you can depend on catching some other exception than TypeError.

Unless you're using a connection per thread, I'd not use threads. If you want to create a simple example recreating the issue I can try and track it down.

If by 'do some work' you mean calling blocking functions, then I would guess
that messages are not written to the socket because the eventloop is not entered
until after the blocking calls return.

Maybe there's a method on ioloop to run the eventloop for one tick and then
continue with your work.

If there are still channels in _channels after that closing loop
ends then I'm inclined to think this is a bug in pika.
Maybe you should open up an issue here:

IIRC channels in _channels are not removed until Channel.CloseOk is received from Rabbit, even if you asked for a Channel.Close.

Just wanted to say thanks for all the work you've put in to rabbit over the
years and also to wish you luck for whatever comes up next. The rabbit
project owes a lot of its success to the contributions you've made, so I'm
looking forward to hearing what you've been up to with $NEW_PROJECT
sometime when I'm back visiting London.

Cheers, and best wishes,

Yes, thank you Matthew for all of your hard work over the years on
Rabbit. Without your initial PoC I doubt we'd have a broker worth
talking about. :) Best of luck with your new ventures! ...and thank
you again for your help with the book!

+1 on what these guys have been saying, without you RabbitMQ as in the
broker, the surrounding software ecosystem, and community wouldn't be what
it is today. So a huge thanks for all the effort you put into the project.
 I wish you luck with your future endeavors!

Cheers!

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Shovel configuration for a clustered broker

I thought I sent along another message, but apparently it didn't go
through.  Viewing this group through the new Google Groups UI is
confusing.

I misunderstood the federation configuration; I see now that you
declare a backing type when you declare the federated exchange, which
makes sense.  I thought the backing type was based on the upstream
exchange.

Going back to shovel for a second... if I have two shovels running in
a cluster, one on each broker, and they connect to their host broker
and consume from the same mirrored queue (the queue is 'shared' across
the cluster) will they simply behave like two consumers on the same
queue, and basically receive messages round-robin?  Because that would
work fine for my scenario.  They'll share the workload unless one of
the brokers in the cluster dies, after which one shovel would be doing
all the work.

Hi Francesco,

I observed similar behavior during my HA testing on V2.8.1. RabbitMQ dropping 
queue randomly when I tried to simulate node failure by stopping rabbitmq 
service.

This was a bug, which was fixed in 2.8.2. Upgrading to the latest
version should solve the problem.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Preserving Order Across Multiple Consumers on a
	Single Queue
Message-ID: <CABPX_bdTXFn__ijmmF4ycSe-RS93OucQY_n6HrsXcr8w8ANrRA@mail.gmail.com>

We are setting up RabbitMQ to accept CRUD messages and talk to consumers
that will interact with our databases.  We have multiple accounts (each one
made up of many other child accounts) that have a dedicated database
instance, and their own dedicated queue.  For a particular queue/database
we would like to prevent collisions on items in the database.  Unless we
parse our messages out, that would mean that RabbitMQ would need to
preserve message order on a queue.

Ideally we want multiple consumers, with each consumer subscribed to
multiple queues.  And if possible, at any point in time, each queue would
only have 1 message being processed by our set of consumers.  We'd only
send another message from a queue out to our consumers after getting an
acknowledgement back that the current one is done.  We'll have multiple
queues, so across the different queues message order doesn't matter.

We did consider using an exclusive queues, but we want to balance our loads
so if 1 account/queue is very active, it is spread across all our
consumers.  Can we set this up fairly easily with RabbitMQ?

Deelo,

Would you mind if we use the official proper rabbit mailing list rather 
than the google group? Thanks. :)

Can you say a bit more about how this timeout occurs, what error message
you see, etc? Is there an exception thrown, for example? I am assuming
that the consumer does see messages arrive if there is no delay?

Hi,
There is no exception or message visible. If the subscriber doesn't receive
anything in 300 seconds it stops subscribing. I managed to solve by using a
heartbeat. I suspect this may have something to do with the fact it is using
an auto delete queue. Still debugging further v
Thxs.

I find it's better to avoid the Google Group, and just use the mailing list

Correct, the shovels will behave as you outlined when consuming.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Consumer
In-Reply-To: <mailman.1.1341054001.10429.rabbitmq-discuss@lists.rabbitmq.com>
Message-ID: <df13db4b-576a-4248-9477-5c6495ecbe45@ucimail1.uci.cu>

In the Producer I need to know if there are Consumers connected to the queue or not, to know if the messages could be processed in a medium or long term. 

I use the java client. To solve my problem I thought in: 

1- to use the method getConsumerCount of the queue. 

AMQP.Queue.DeclareOk my_queue = queueDeclare("name_queue", false, false, false, null); 
int cont = my_queue.getConsumerCount(); 

but, the consumer is disconnected of the queue when it is processing the message. For this reason, the Producer fails to recognize that there are Consumers for to work when really yes exist. 

2- Declaring a queue as passive in the Producer and autodelete in the Consumer. Thus, the queue only exists when the Consumer is connected and the queue is destroyed when the Consumer dies. 

In el Consumer: channel.queueDeclare("nam_queue", false, false, true, null); 

but the queue is also destroyed when the Consumer reads every message. 

Any idea for to know in the Producer if there are Consumers connected? 

Thanks in advance. 
Yuri.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Vanishing of persistent messages on durable,
 auto-deleting queue with dead-lettering
Message-ID: <4FEDD75D.1030808@comarch.pl>

When I was testing RabbitMQ I encountered a strange (in my opinion) 
behavior. After disconnecting
a client from durable, auto-deleting queue with dead-lettering-exchange 
I would expect passing all
messages to dead letter exchange and then deleting queue. But 
surprisingly for me queue was deleted
and messages just vanished into limbo.

Is this behavior desirable? Why?

How should I get around this problem?
I thought about declare queue as non auto deleting and making own 
monitoring daemon,
which could handle cleaning queues without consumers. Is there any 
simpler way of achieve my goal?

Best regards,
Ernest Staszuk

there a workaround for this issue? I'm surprised the connection drops
silently without any warning despite using heartbeats.

		ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
		factory.setHost(host);
		factory.setRequestedHeartbeat(10);
		
		Connection connection = factory.newConnection();
		
		Channel channel = connection.createChannel();

		channel.exchangeDeclare(exchange, "topic");
		String queueName = channel.queueDeclare().getQueue();
		channel.queueBind(queueName, exchange, topic);
		consumer = new QueueingConsumer(channel);
		channel.basicConsume(queueName, true, consumer);

I've tried adding this to my rabbitmq.config:

[
        {rabbit, [{tcp_listen_options, [{keepalive, true}]}]}
].

but I receive errors as soon as I try to subscribe:

immediately following the publish is failing. Is it possible that you
are publishing to a non-existent exchange (testexchange)? What does the
broker logfile say? The solution in this case is to make sure that the
exchange you publish to exists.

could be something totally different.
Application creates multiple Connection/Channel pairs and each is assigned
its own Consumer instance.
We have a single consumer per channel per connection.

Here's a snippet of code from Consumer.handleDelivery() method modified to
remove business specific information.
But this is the gist of what happens when a message is received.

    public final void handleDelivery(String consumerTag, Envelope envelope,
            BasicProperties properties, byte[] body) throws IOException {

        boolean failed = false;
        Throwable failureReason = null;
        try {
            // create a delivery for the client
            delivery = createDelivery(consumerTag, body, envelope,
properties);
            // deliver to client
            deliveryHandler.handleDelivery(delivery);
        } catch (Throwable e) {
            // client had a problem handling/processing delivery
            failed = true;
            failureReason = e;
            log.error("Client failed while handling delivery. "
                    + e.getMessage(), e);
        } finally {
            if (failed) {
                handleFailedDelivery(
                        failureReason, body, properties);
            } else {
                try {
                    acknowledge(envelope.getDeliveryTag());
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    notifyClient(e);
                }
            }
        }
    }

Envelope object that is handed to the method as an argument stays method
local.
Our application is connecting to the cluster through a netscaler VIP.

We have not seen this problem when consuming from a local cluster with the
same application.

Any help or pointer in the right direction is appreciated.

Thanks,
Vineet

That is, it looks like a Basic.Deliver and a Basic.Publish are sneaking in
before the Tx.Commit-Ok comes back.

I suspect this is a Pika issue, but my reading of the code doesn't show any
obvious problems.

Thanks,

Matt

Publishers and Consumers. e.g publisher has to switch to a different node
of RabbitMQ Cluster if one node fails. Same way for consumers. Is there a
way publisher & consumer can just connect with RabbitMQ cluster via a
single nodename ? Without knowing which cluster node is serving them ?

I want to  install RabbitMQ cluster in 1x1 configuration ( both RAM nodes
). And my intention is only that if one node fails, then all publishing and
consuming tranparently gets switched to other cluster node.

Is it doable ? Any thoughts will be appreciated.

Thanks

able to subscribe to a queue that is named is such a way that it
contains their client id, and being able to publish to a
server-generated queue is sufficient. You can set up access control
rules that allow this.

Bear in mind that clients have no way of learning the names of
server-generated queues that were generated for other clients, and they
are named in a cryptographically strong way. Therefore the vhost
isolation is not strictly required to protect against inadvertent access.

i realized that I can only send ACKs from the original connection/channel
that was used to receive a message. This sorta blocks me from implementing
the use/case I wanted. Here is the scenario:

- Publisher sends a message to RabbitMQ queue (via exchange using routing
key and binding).
- Subscriber gets the message. It doesn't ACK immediately because message
processing involves database operation. If database operations goes well,
then ACK will be sent. If database operation fails, no ACK will be sent and
message will be redelivered later (which is great, because I want to retry
the operation).
- Database operation goes through and the subscriber tries to send ACK.
Immediately before that, RabbitMQ host becomes unavailable and ACK doesn't
go through (I get the exception, so I am notified that ACKing failed).
- My operation is not idempotent right now, so when another subscriber
connects to RabbitMQ (after it becomes available), the same message will be
redelivered to it (because ACK didn't go through). This will cause
duplicated operations, because original message was never ACKed properly.

I wanted to save ACKs to disk and then recover them (send them to RabbitMQ)
before new connections from subscribers are made. However, from the link
above it seems that this is not possible with RabbitMQ? Is there a way for
me to implement this or should I treat ACKs differently? If ACK should only
indicate if message transfer was okay, then I suppose using autoacking
feature (when consumer is initialized setting noAck parameter to true) is
better than doing it manually. In that case, is there a way for me to
request redelivery of this message from Rabbit even though it was previously
ACKed?

Thanks a lot for your time!
Milan

(100s) with 1 or 2 exchanges each or have a handful of vhosts with 100s of 
exchanges per vhost.  Or does it not matter?

But if we do not set any user permissions, simply use rabbitmq system 
default guest user, and create 5000 unique connections/queues to the 
server, our client side message rate is 12000 messages per second. 


My question is: what contributes to the 30% performance degradation?

Message-ID: <mailman.20.1348502324.8494.rabbitmq-discuss@lists.rabbitmq.com>

that I have to set the reply-to header. I've done that by specifying 
something like "reply-to: /temp-queue/foo" and I saw in my server-side 
client (node-amqp) that the replyTo header is set correctly 
(example: replyTo: '/reply-queue/amq.gen-w2jykNGp4DNDBADm3C4Cdx'). Still in 
my server-side client, I can reply to the message just by publishing a 
message to "/reply-queue/amq.gen-w2jykNGp4DNDBADm3C4Cdx".

However, how do I get this reply it in my client code where the RPC call 
was initiated? The documentation states "SEND and SUBSCRIBE frames *must not
* contain /temp-queue destinations (...) subscriptions to reply queues are 
created automatically."

So, how do I subscribe to the reply-to queue? How can I get the results of 
RPC calls?

Thanks in advance.

statistics are generated too fast for the management database to keep
up. Can I suggest that you turn off fine grained statistics (this will
disable display of message rates) by adding this stanza to the config file:

 {rabbitmq_management_agent, [{force_fine_statistics, false}]}

and increase the statistics collection interval from 5000ms to higher
number and see if that helps:

 {rabbit, [{collect_statistics_interval, 10000}]}

request returned a 404 error. (The time was the same on both brokers)
Previous to this moment in time, all HTTP queries were successful, and
after this moment in time, all queries were sucessful - As I said, just one
blip on each broker.

The only interesting thing we noticed in the logs was that the primary
broker's rabbit at xxx-sasl file had this little snippet about 30 seconds *
after* the hiccup occurred:

=SUPERVISOR REPORT==== 12-Oct-2012::15:06:47 ===
Supervisor: {<0.25499.41>, rabbit_channel_sup_sup}
Context: shutdown_error
Reason: shutdown
Offender: [{pid,<0.25503.41>},
{name,channel_sup},
{mfa,{rabbit_channel_sup,start_link,[]}},
{restart_type,temporary},
{shutdown,infinity},
{child_type,supervisor}]

I'm mostly at a loss to process what the snippet is telling me, nor can
tell if the two things are related. Any help is appreciated!

Thanks,

Matt

Peter,<br><br>It&#39;s unfortunate that you&#39;ve dropped back to 2.7.1 as=
 you get better visibility via rabbitmqctl of available descriptors with 2.=
8.*. If you fire up an Erlang shell and enter &quot;erlang:system_info(chec=
k_io).&quot;, you&#39;ll see max_fds listed in the output. I&#39;ve not got=
 a Windows server readily available to check, but my guess is the default l=
imit is something like 256. <br>
<br>ERL_MAX_PORTS is set as a Windows environment variable.<br><br>In your =
original post the following message makes me thing that you&#39;d hit the f=
d limit. <br><br><p class=3D"MsoNormal">=3DINFO REPORT=3D=3D=3D=3D 6-Nov-20=
12::16:30:13 =3D=3D=3D</p>
=A0=A0=A0 alarm_handler: {clear,file_descriptor_limit}<br><br>This message =
is logged when the situation is cleared, so somewhere=20
higher up in the log there should be a corresponding &quot;alarm_handler:=
=20
{set,{file_descriptor_limit,[]}}&quot; or some such message.<br><br>From th=
e log fragment you included it looks like 192.168.0.100 had quite a number =
of connections (which may of course be perfectly valid, depending on how yo=
ur app is designed).<br>

Hi Brett,

 

How would I check for available sockets/file descriptors?

 

I had the config running about a year ago with the same number of machines
involved and didn't see this problem.

 

I've spotted this article
http://rabbitmq.1065348.n5.nabble.com/RabbitMQ-2-8-2-Service-Crash-on-Window
s-2008-R2-td21512.html which mentions setting ERL_MAX_PORTS. Is that
relevant and where would I change that?

 

Sorry for all the questions.

 

I've also removed the management plugin just now.

 

This is the config for Rabbit:

 

C:\Program Files (x86)\RabbitMQ
Server\rabbitmq_server-2.7.1\sbin>rabbitmqctl.b

Peter,

Have you checked that you're not running out of sockets/file descriptors?

Regards,
Brett

P.S. Good to see someone in NZ using rabbit.

I've looked through the rabbit@*.log and rabbit@*sals.log and see a series
of connections closing.

 

What's causing this problem; no further connection is possible to the
RabbitMQ server after this? Any suggestions are appreciated. 

 

I was running the latest build of Erlang/RabbitMQ but downgraded this to an
earlier version to see if that corrected the problem but it didn't.

(Windows 2008 R2 Server with firewall turned off).

 

Logs relate to this version:

rabbitmq-server-2.7.1.exe

otp_win32_R15B.exe

 

Also tried with same result:

rabbitmq-server-2.8.7.exe

otp_win64_R15B02_with_MSVCR100_installer_fix.exe

If you want to test, master is fairly stable at this point and it can be installed via pip:

 pip install -e git+https://github.com/pika/pika.git#egg=pika

Sorry for the trouble.

When using curl (on the loadbalancer) with the same cipher list
(verified with tcpdump) it succeeds.

This is the TLSv1 communication:
> Client Hello
< Server Hello
> Finished
> Alert (Level: Fatal, Description: Unexpected Message)

This is the rabbitmq.config:

  {rabbitmq_mochiweb, [
      {listeners, [
          {mgmt, [
              {port, 443},
              {ssl, true},
              {ssl_opts, [
                  {cacertfile,"/local/secret/ssl/comodo-chain-2009.pem"},
                  {certfile,"/local/secret/ssl/esb-test.it.su.se.pem"},
                  {keyfile,"/local/secret/ssl/esb-test.it.su.se.key"},
                  {verify,verify_none}
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },

I've added ssl_opts just to make sure that it was using it, before we
didn't have it since it will automatically inherit those settings from
our rabbit config.

We currently use the LB to Apache-servers so we know it should work.

If you need, you can get pcaps on demand.

The RabbitMQ machine runs on Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS and uses Erlang R13B03
(ancient, I know).

Thanks and have a great weekend!

1> You place a PERSISTENT_TEXT_PLAIN in the basicPublish call to perform
persistence

 2>  You use a channel.txSelect and a channel.txCommit to perform
transactions

However, from the examples I have seen, there is no such requirement on the
consumer side

1>  Do I have to perform any special coding for a consumption of a
persistent message.

2> Do I have to use a txCommit to perform a transaction of the ACKNOLEDGE on
a consumer (I understand that the consumption is not under a tx basis).

drains the old master queue of messages until it's empty? Am I way off base 
here?

Thanks a lot for your help.

We are planning on using RabbitMQ extensively and I am writing some documentation right now so I just wanted to confirm something. Let's say I have a cluster of 3 machines running rabbit. All of my queues are durable and the node with the master durable queue dies. A new master is chosen and life goes on. Well, what happens when this old master rejoins the cluster? From what I understand is that it just gets a new empty slave copy and just drains the old master queue of messages until it's empty? Am I way off base here?<div><br></div><div>Thanks a lot for your help.</div>

So you have less than the required 1GB disk space available and hence publi=
shing will be blocked. See <a href=3D"http://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#d=
iskfreesup-usage" target=3D"_blank">http://www.rabbitmq.com/<u></u>memory.h=
tml#diskfreesup-usage</a><br>


<br>
There should be an alarm recorded in the logs. Please check. And the alarm =
should be visible in the management UI too. And any publishing connections =
should show as &#39;blocked&#39; in both &#39;rabbitmqctl list_connection&#=
39; and the management UI.<br>

So you have less than the required 1GB disk space available and hence publi=
shing will be blocked. See <a href=3D"http://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#d=
iskfreesup-usage" target=3D"_blank">http://www.rabbitmq.com/<u></u>memory.h=
tml#diskfreesup-usage</a><br>


<br>
There should be an alarm recorded in the logs. Please check. And the alarm =
should be visible in the management UI too. And any publishing connections =
should show as &#39;blocked&#39; in both &#39;rabbitmqctl list_connection&#=
39; and the management UI.<br>

Message-ID: <mailman.37.1359738030.8494.rabbitmq-discuss@lists.rabbitmq.com>

the connections would be blocked preventing messages from being published. 
In order to modify the limit, we can modify the value inside 
rabbitmq.config file but I noticed that I don't have that file under 
/etc/rabbitmq, though it was mentioned that that file can be created 
manually, I don't really find any documentation that gives steps of setting 
up that file. Is there any other way to modify that configuration apart 
from modifying it inside the config file? Any help would be much 
appreciated. Thanks

1. Scenario : RabbitMQ server is continuously running and listening the
specific application.
And that application is sending the result data (message) in queue. And the
required messages of queue are read by RabbitMQ client.

If Client gets shut down/off for 2hrs. after that time again clients come
up (on/logg in) iand start accessing the message from RabbitMQ server.
Then will these client can get the messages which are generated in betweent
this shut down time?

2. Is the RabbitMQ server maintain some specific timed history message
like...2 week back information of application. Is that maintain in queue?

3. How cae we define the size of queue?

4. How can we stop the to accessing the server from clients? Is any command
is exist?

Thanks in advance!!!

Regards,
Prasad

Subject:  RabbitMQ blocking issue

We have an issue with our RabbitMQ clients not publishing to our RabbitMQ s=
erver. We see that the client hangs approx. every 2 hours and never recover=
s.

Versions:
Client: amqp-client-2.8.7.jar  , spring-amqp-1.1.1.RELEASE.jar
server: noarch/rabbitmq-server-2.8.7-1.noarch.rpm

On the client side we see that our application stops working. When we query=
 the port we see:
[pkonar at ajtrafp067 ~]$ netstat -an | grep 5672
tcp        0 194017 ::ffff:10.196.42.93:47657   ::ffff:10.196.42.43:5672   =
 FIN_WAIT1
tcp        0   2722 ::ffff:10.196.42.93:46361   ::ffff:10.196.42.43:5672   =
 ESTABLISHED

The FIN_WAIT1 is from the application restart and never recovers the port. =
Meaning never releases the port from FIN_WAIT1. After restarting the applic=
ation we see a new connection created the works, but we would prefer not re=
starting the app every 2 hours.

Server side
