<PRE>Ben,

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In your patch, you also added an extra method to handle a spurious
</I>&gt;<i> consume_ok message;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> %% Edwin Fine bugfix: This is actually being called wrong from somewhere,
</I>&gt;<i> %% but this will fix it.
</I>&gt;<i> handle_method({'basic.consume_ok', ConsumerTag}, State) -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     io:format(&quot;[~p] Got bad handle_method call!~n&quot;, [self()]),
</I>&gt;<i>     handle_method(#'basic.consume_ok'{consumer_tag = ConsumerTag}, State);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This method is preceded in the code by the following function:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> handle_method(BasicConsumeOk = #'basic.consume_ok'{consumer_tag =
</I>&gt;<i> ConsumerTag},
</I>&gt;<i>                         State = #channel_state{pending_consumer =
</I>&gt;<i> Consumer}) -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     Consumer ! BasicConsumeOk,
</I>&gt;<i>     NewState = register_consumer(ConsumerTag, Consumer, State),
</I>&gt;<i>     {noreply, NewState2} = rpc_bottom_half(BasicConsumeOk, NewState),
</I>&gt;<i>     {noreply, NewState2#channel_state{pending_consumer = &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;} };
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I not quite sure why that didn't match first
</I>&gt;<i> because #'basic.consume_ok'{consumer_tag = ConsumerTag} should match
</I>&gt;<i> against {'basic.consume_ok', ConsumerTag}
</I>&gt;<i> and #channel_state{pending_consumer = Consumer} should match even if the
</I>&gt;<i> pending_consumer was not defined.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Actually, I was in the middle of trying to get that right, and it was late,
so I would ignore that comment (and the code) completely. In fact I have
removed it from the most recent code. I was trying to get rid of the error
that I saw in the stack trace of the amqp_channel, namely

** Reason for termination ==
** {badarg,[{amqp_channel,handle_method,2},
            {gen_server,handle_msg,5},
            {proc_lib,init_p,5}]}

Now that I am doing the basic.consume in the process that starts the
consumers, the above issue does not occur.
Thanks for all your help. In the meantime, until you have a more elegant
bugfix (to the rabbit_writer proliferation) than my hack, I will just
continue to use my modified Erlang client.

Ben, you also wrote:

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That's a good point. I think the cleanup code should go into the
</I>gen_server terminate callback to keep it one place.

Funny thing, that - I *did* put the cleanup code into the terminate, but it
did not seem to be called. It was only when I put it directly before the
{stop, xxx} returns that it finally got called. Again, this may have just
been late night syndrome, but I had extensive print statements and could
clearly see that it was not happening. At that time all I wanted was to get
it to work. Please understand that all the code I have submitted (other than
amqp_channel) is a pure hack to try to expose and duplicate the errors!

Thanks again.
Regards,
Ed
