<PRE>BTW Edwin, I reposting this to the list, so it can be followed.

Shouldn't be an issue.
&gt;<i> Each queue is doing a basic.deliver to one of 50 Erlang consumer

</I>&gt;<i> channel (which may not be a good idea, because when the channel  
</I>&gt;<i> crashed, so did all 50 consumers. I wonder if I should have 1  
</I>&gt;<i> channel for each consumer? Too heavy?).
</I>Good question. The golden answer I guess is not too little, not too  
much ;-) Your mileage will vary.

If there is a bug, however, the channel process will bring all of the  
consumers that are linked to it. So from a *resiliency* perspective,  
you might want to have more than one channel process. Having said  
that, I would prefer to find out what the cause was and identify  
whether there is a bug that needs to fixed.

In terms of the difference this makes on overall throughput, I think  
the answer is that it depends. Using the network client you are  
receiving serially from a single client socket, so it may be 6 of one  
and half a dozen of the other. In the direct case, you may see more  
leverage effect here.

&gt;<i> Because the channel.flow command is not implemented, I am using  
</I>&gt;<i> unsubscribe to try to do flow control, because I am finding that  
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ is dumping all the basic.deliver messages into the Erlang  
</I>&gt;<i> message queue of each consumer gen_event process. This is totally  
</I>&gt;<i> not what I want - I want the messages to stay persisted in Rabbit- 
</I>&gt;<i> land until I can deliver them and tell Rabbit to release them.
</I>At the moment, Rabbit is designed to deliver a message if it can.  
Control flow is more of a server implementation issue. Thoughts anyone?

&gt;<i> The reason I need flow control is because I am delivering messages  
</I>&gt;<i> via HTTP/XML to a number of different Web sites. Sometimes a web  
</I>&gt;<i> site may be down, often for hours, and I want to just be able to  
</I>&gt;<i> pause the consumer (and producer) until messages start going through  
</I>&gt;<i> again. Having the Erlang message queues filling up with thousands of  
</I>&gt;<i> messages will eventually crash the VM due to OOM. I know I can poll  
</I>&gt;<i> with basic.get, but the conundrum is that I want high performance  
</I>&gt;<i> while the web sites are accepting input, and shut-off when they are  
</I>&gt;<i> not. Any suggestions?
</I>
One strategy that springs to mind to turn the no_ack flag when sending  
the consume command to the broker. I will have to have a look to see  
what the behaviour of this, because I don't know off the top my head.  
Alternatively if you can detect the failure of a web site, can you  
actively cancel the subscription?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I may have to build a simulated version of the above to get the  
</I>&gt;<i> problem to happen again. That's the hesitation - will it trigger the  
</I>&gt;<i> error?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Let's hope so. If not, and if you feel comfortable with it, you send  
you raw code base.

&gt;<i> Anyway, I am probably not doing this the right way, but I have no  
</I>&gt;<i> expertise in AMQP. My knowledge is of MQSeries a few years back.
</I>
I don't think this will be a problem :-) AMQP is not MQ :-)

HTH,

Ben
