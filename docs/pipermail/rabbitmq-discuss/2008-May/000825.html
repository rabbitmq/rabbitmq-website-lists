<PRE>Thanks, Ben, I will take a look and give you some feedback.

In the meantime, I have done the following:

   - Changed my consumer code (I use the term &quot;consumer&quot; loosely as
   &quot;anything that eats the output of a producer&quot;) to use basic.get instead of
   basic.consume. Actually, it's set up so that I can select basic.get or
   basic.consume behavior at run-time. I didn't want to throw away working
   basic.consume code :)
   - Changed the process that creates consumers so that it now creates one
   channel per consumer. Previously, there was one channel only for all
   consumers. One-channel-per-consumer was the only way I could get the code to
   work with the network client; in the one-channel scenario I was getting back
   responses to messages destined for different consumers. I assume that with
   your changes I will be able to again use one channel for all consumers.
   - I tested with 50 queues (each with its own consumer and channel) and it
   seemed reasonably performant, even with the get. I need to try a full-blast
   test soon.

Again, thanks for your help and patience, and do let me know if you see any
merit in the rbmq_admin module I wrote, or if maybe you guys are releasing
an official one.

Regards,
Ed

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> done on a channel other than responding with basic.ack to basic.deliver
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> messages.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've begun a discussion on this topic and it looks like we will add the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intelligence to the amqp_channel module to be able to serialize concurrent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RPC requests to the channel. I understand that you have a workaround anyway,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but on reflection, it seems like a good idea to put this capability into the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client. will let you know when it is done.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This feature is now implemented in the trunk of the repo. There is also a
</I>&gt;<i> test case to test the serialization of concurrent RPC requests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will now look into the next 2 issues you raised.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I am also in the process of moving the mtn repo to hg, so this might
</I>&gt;<i> happen very soon as well.
