<PRE>Fran&#231;ois,

2011/9/27 Fran&#231;ois Beausoleil &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">francois at teksol.info</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> According to the management console's overview tab, I've reached my memory high watermark. I have two queues with a combined total of 2.5M messages. My workers are up and running, but in both cases, the queue consumers read messages and may publish messages to another exchange.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can restart my workers, in which case the messages are unack'd and put back in the queue, to be processed again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there a way around this? What can I do to process those messages? Can I tweak something in the server while it's up? I don't want to reboot it because I've lost messages before, even though my messages are published using :persistent =&gt; true (Bunny).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rereading <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/admin-guide.html#memsup,">http://www.rabbitmq.com/admin-guide.html#memsup,</A> I notice that it says I should use multiple connections: one for producing, one for consuming. I'll have to change my apps to do that, but in the meantime?
</I>
The easiest thing to do is to beef up your machine and give Rabbit
more RAM (adding a SSD drive may additionally help :P).

When Rabbit hits the memory limit, there's really not much that can be
done. In theory the *consumers* should still be able to consume
messages, and thus free some memory over time.

But in practice, due to AMQP constraints RabbitMQ can't really
distinguish producers and consumers on per-channel basis. Instead,
Rabbit looks at the connection. If there are messages produced on a
connection - it will be blocked to avoid the need to cope with even
more messages.

Erlang VM is likely to crash if there isn't enough free memory to do a
full garbage collection cycle.

If you don't care about messages, you can try to purge messages or
remove unused queues. But I guess, you should be using different
connections for producing and consuming. Sorry.

Hope that helps,
 Marek
