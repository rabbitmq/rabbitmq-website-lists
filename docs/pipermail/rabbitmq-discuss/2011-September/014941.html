<PRE>Thanks Gavin, that actually seems to be exactly what I had tried previously, but didn&#8217;t work correctly.

Going to re-investigate that solution that I tried and see if I just missed something in there.

One thing that I notice actually, is  you&#8217;ve declared 2 globals, which I have implemented differently, the on_open function I have is defined as: def _on_channel_open(self, channel_, callback_=None):

Which then assigned channel_ to self.channel

When I implemented the change, I had self.channel, and self.monitor_channel. However everything else looks the same. Going to have to put all of that back in at this point to double check my work. I had reverted at this point to look into alternative solutions.

Only using one connection is the point of this modification.
Oh that's easy then.

I already have a setup that does an asynchronous call that instantiates a Pika Publisher to publish a message to the queue, and a Pika Monitor to consume messages. However those each create their own connection and ioloops.
No need for that.
Am I chasing my tail trying to get multiple channels created for a single connection? Then creating a queue on each channel, one to monitor, one to publish to?
You don't need a channel per queue really, but it should be easy to create -- this is more pseudocode, but should get the spirit across:

conn = FooConnection(on_connection_open)
conn.ioloop.start()

def on_connection_open(conn):
  conn.channel(on_channel_one_open)
  conn.channel(on_channel_two_open)

def on_channel_one_open(channel):
  global channel_one
  channel_one = channel
  channel_one.create_queue(on_monitor_queue_created)

def on_monitor_queue_created(frame)
  channel_one.basic_consume('routing_key', monitor_consumer_function)

def on_channel_two_open(channel):
  global channel_two
  channel_two = channel
  for x in xrange(0, 10000):
    publish_consumer_function(x)
