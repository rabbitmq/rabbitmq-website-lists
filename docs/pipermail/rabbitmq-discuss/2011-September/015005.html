I think that summary is consistent with my understanding of mnesia and
the HA code.

Correct.

&gt;<i> BTW, how long is this timeout?  Is it configurable?
</I>
30 seconds, and no. Well, not without recompiling the broker.

&gt;<i> So would it be fair to say that mirrored queues are fault tolerant to node

</I>
That's fair. Also, I've recently been reminded that we don't really
claim to support network partitions - this is mainly due to the fact
that mnesia itself doesn't support network partitions really - hence the
issues with the tables needing to converge and resetting a node if it's
not. This is consistent with choosing C and A from the CAP triangle.
