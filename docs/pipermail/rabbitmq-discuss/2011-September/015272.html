<PRE>Hi Alex,

Thanks so much for the detailed reply. I had begun thinking along
these lines, but really appreciate the level of detail regarding the
specific types of publish requests, queues and exchanges. This is
really helpful and will likely save me many hours of trial and error.
I do have just one quick question though regarding the following:

&quot;In addition, when processing &quot;please log out this user&quot; messages, a
machine should *not* acknowledge that it has received the message
until after it publishes its response (this way, if the machine dies
while processing, the sender will get a basic.return for it).&quot;

Am I correct in understanding from this that, in the direct exchange
context, I can control when the consumer machine sends back its ack,
by calling something like basicAck at some point in the consumption/
delivery code? If so, I would expect that I could skip the return
publishing (i.e., the response) from the consumer to the producer and
simply check confirms and confirms + basic.returns for each message
sent directly to each machine. Moreover, if, prior to publishing, I
associate the machine (or direct queue corresponding to it) to the
message to be sent, I should be able to find out which machines
present which form of response (i.e., confirm or confirm +
basic.return). Does this make sense or am I still reading too much
into the consumer ack (such that, for example, the confirmation
received by the publisher just represents the handoff of the message
to the queue and not its uptake by the consumer)?

Thanks again, really, I very much appreciate your help.

Cheers,
Jonathan

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could kind of get what you want with AMQP. &#160;Use a fanout exchange
</I>&gt;<i> like you want for broadcast messages, but use a direct exchange for
</I>&gt;<i> direct communication between machines. &#160;You could use the fanout
</I>&gt;<i> exchange to make sure that all the machines know about each other (in
</I>&gt;<i> particular, that each knows the queues the others bound to the direct
</I>&gt;<i> exchange, so that they can communicate directly). &#160;And you could use the
</I>&gt;<i> direct exchange to publish persistent, confirm, mandatory, immediate messages
</I>&gt;<i> directly to other machines. &#160;With these messages, the sender will be
</I>&gt;<i> notified if the other machine received the message (only a confirm is
</I>&gt;<i> received for the publish), or if the other machine went offline in the past
</I>&gt;<i> (a basic.return and a confirm is received). &#160;This way, the sending
</I>&gt;<i> machine would know which other machines received its message and, so,
</I>&gt;<i> will know to wait for the correct number of responses. &#160;The queue bound
</I>&gt;<i> to the direct exchange would have to be durable, auto-delete for this to
</I>&gt;<i> work (durable for confirms to work and auto-delete so that once the sole
</I>&gt;<i> consumer dies, the queue is deleted and publishing to it will result in
</I>&gt;<i> a basic.return). &#160;In addition, when processing &quot;please log out this
</I>&gt;<i> user&quot; messages, a machine should *not* acknowledge that it has
</I>&gt;<i> received the message until after it publishes its response (this way, if

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for clarifying that. From the explication of the rules for

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the case, I have 2 brief follow up questions:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Do consumer acks have more significance in transactions, such that

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; They concern the interaction between producers and the broker, and &#160;have

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Yes, there are some conditions in which a consumer ack can trigger a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; confirm in RabbitMQ, but that is an implementation detail and not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; something you'd want to design an application around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; My hope is that I will not have to aggregate a list of servers and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; pass along a single message to each server, but perhaps that is what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; will be required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You can still send a single message via a fanout exchange. But the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; consumers then in turn need to send a message back to the sender. Your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sender will need to know how many consumers there are so it knows when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it has gotten all responses..
</I>&gt;<i>
