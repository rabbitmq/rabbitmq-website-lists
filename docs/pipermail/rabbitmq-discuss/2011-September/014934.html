<PRE>EXACTLY!

That's the bit that I'm getting stuck on.

I have a publish method that sets up a connection, then calls another function to open a channel, then publishes to the queue as shown previously.

Within that function is a connection.ioloop.start() which I guess I don't really understand. For the individual publish/monitor functions they work as expected, the monitor will monitor and consume, while the publish only publishes once and breaks the ioloop, as expected.

To get an asynchronous Publish, then Monitor the reply_to queue, I can instantiate the classes for the monitor/publisher I have, and it will work with 2 connections to the server. However trying to get this done with one connection is where I'm balking.

Well, if you want to use asynchronous style, than you need to have
an event loop and program using callbacks.
