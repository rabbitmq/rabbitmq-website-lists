Wow - I'd not considered that file systems these days would still have
such limits... In my own testing a little while ago, I found that JFS
had the best performance for my hardware when running Rabbit, but I
didn't do any huge scaling tests so I wouldn't be surprised if that has
even lower limits for such things.

Certainly my testing of ext4 is not favourable. It seems to have very
inconsistent performance. That said, if it works for you...
