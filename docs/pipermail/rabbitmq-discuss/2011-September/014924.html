I think you're seeing the same issue reported here:

<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2011-September/014917.html">http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2011-September/014917.html</A>

Sorry about this, I didn't think changing the realm name would break 
things. I won't change it again :)

&gt;<i> But I can see when I do a wget from the nagios server to the rabbitmq-
</I>&gt;<i> server, first of all a &quot;401 Unauthorized&quot; appears then the wget works,
</I>&gt;<i> its like as if there isdouble authentication happening and it fails on

</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmq-server&amp;  plugins)
</I>
Umm, isn't that how HTTP authentication works?

&gt;<i>  From what I have been reading and a colleague mention he had a problem
</I>&gt;<i> with the Authentication Realm before, could it be related to that?
</I>
Yes, sounds like it.

Cheers, Simon
