<PRE>I'm having some difficulty with creating a mirrored queue so that I
can test it. The management plugin only thinks the queue is half-
present, rabbitmqctl doesn't think it's there at all, and the AMQP API
seems to be blocking when it shouldn't.


1. I created a two-node cluster.  This much seems fine.
cluster_status gives the right report on both machines:
Cluster status of node <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at ps7</A> ...

[{nodes,[{disc,[<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at ps8</A><A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">,rabbit at ps7</A>]}]},
 {running_nodes,[<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at ps8</A><A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">,rabbit at ps7</A>]}]

2. I used the Perl API to create an HA queue.  This reported success
via the AMQP, and the management plugin sees the queue and its
parameters correctly.  When I hover over HA I see &quot;x-ha-policy:
nodes&quot;, and when I hover over Args I see &quot;x-ha-policy-params:
[<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at ps7</A><A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">,rabbit at ps8</A>]&quot;.  A get to the HTTP API shows the same
data, in JSON of course.

3. When I issue a consume to the queue, my client hangs, rather than
continuing as it did in my non-HA test.  This may be a quirk of the
client, but it is a change from the non-HA working behavior.

4. The output of &quot;rabbitmqctl list_queues&quot; is completely empty.

5. The management plugin seems conflicted as to whether the queue
exists or not.  The queue is present and visible in the queue list,
but when I go to the queue's page the big items for Ready, Unacknowledged,
and Total all show &quot;?&quot; instead of a number, and a GET to the queue's
specific URL returns a 404 error.

How can I diagnose this situation and/or make this work right?
