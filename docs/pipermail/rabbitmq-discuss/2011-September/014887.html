<PRE>Hi Matthew,

Thanks for your detailed reply.

</I>I did look at publisher confirms but my initial use case requires at
most once delivery, where a cluster of ESBs are reading the queue
(making only-once from at-least-once hard).  I expect future use cases
require these features as we move more message types through RabbitMQ in
the future.

I experimented with publisher confirms and noticed that messages seemed
more likely to be persisted, but seemed to trickle into the server.
That is 5 minutes after my test finished messages were still arriving to
my queue.  I have since experimented with message size, my original
messages were very small and think that I need to modify this test to
understand these affects properly.

I hope to experiment more with this and ha once our first implementation
is released.

Thanks,
Iain.
