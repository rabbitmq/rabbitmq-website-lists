I really wouldn't. I don't think the model should be adulterated with 
operational concerns (that's why, for instance, the &quot;durable&quot; flag is daft).

What I wouldn't mind is if there was management interface encoded in 
AMQP.  There's sort of provision already there for it, in the system 
exchange type.  Qpid has a whole framework (QMF) based on this approach, 
though I think it rather too keen to be generic.

&gt;<i> It's interesting how the &quot;semantic equiv check&quot; on queue.declare (in the

</I>&gt;<i> mutable aspects of queues.
</I>
Yes, good observation. In fact I'd say that anything that appears in the 
fields or arguments that doesn't seem like it should be part of that 
equivalence check, ought not to be in the arguments. (&quot;Durable&quot; fails 
this test, for example)
