If you benchmark different Linux filesystems, be very careful to make
sure that you are doing apples-to-apples comparisons.  Different
filesystems have different data integrity guarantees.  In particular,
ext3 and ext4 get different numbers mainly because they have different
defaults for the 'barrier' option.  So you need to explicitly set this
option in order to perform a fair comparison.  Last time I did this,
their performance seemed roughly equivalent.
