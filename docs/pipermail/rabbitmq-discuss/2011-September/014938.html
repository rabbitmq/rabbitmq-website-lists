<PRE> You can have multiple connections with one IO loop, assuming you're using PIka. In that case, the IOloop is a single instance across all connections, so you should setup both your connections before starting it, or use a timer to call a method after starting it that sets up your connections.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Within that function is a connection.ioloop.start() which I guess I don't really understand. For the individual publish/monitor functions they work as expected, the monitor will monitor and consume, while the publish only publishes once and breaks the ioloop, as expected.

</I>&gt;<i> To get an asynchronous Publish, then Monitor the reply_to queue, I can instantiate the classes for the monitor/publisher I have, and it will work with 2 connections to the server. However trying to get this done with one connection is where I'm balking.
