Yeah, that's certainly a problem. As you might guess I bumped into this 
several times developing the federation plugin.

</I>
But I'm not sure that this is the solution. What if a plugin gets 
uninstalled temporarily by mistake? That's far too easy to do at the 
moment during an upgrade, and while the changes to the plugin system 
should mitigate that *a lot* the idea that:

# rabbitmq-plugin uninstall rabbitmq_federation
# rabbitmq-plugin install rabbitmq_federation

could delete exchanges and bindings seems pretty alarming to me.

It seems that this is primarily an issue around exchange type plugins. I 
wonder if we could just not recover exchanges that have an unrecognised 
type? The trouble is, then you have a &quot;hidden&quot; exchange that will pop 
back as soon as you reinstall the plugin, but without the plugin you 
can't get rid of it, and attempts to redeclare it with a different type 
will always fail. Hmm.

Cheers, Simon
