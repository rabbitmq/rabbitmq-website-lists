For 2.5.1 I tried to create some more .deb packages for the other 
plugins, following the Ubuntu model used in rabbitmq-stomp, but oh my, 
it was indeed tricky to achieve and I gave up and basically pinned the 
server package at a given point so it didn't upgrade automatically and 
break everything.

But this is a worry, since it's inevitable that someone else will, 
sooner or later, notice that the version is behind and upgrade it 
without realising the implications. :(

&gt;<i> So the new plan is to rearrange things so that all the official plugins
</I>&gt;<i> end up bundled along with the server in a standard way for all
</I>&gt;<i> packaging, and we ship a tool that lets you turn them on or off.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I don't have a date for when this will happen, but it is being
</I>&gt;<i> worked on.
</I>
Glad to hear it is being looked at.


thanks,
Toby
