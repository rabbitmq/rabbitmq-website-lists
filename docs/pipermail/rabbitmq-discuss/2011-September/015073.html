We're very aware of this, but have been struggling to get to the right 
answer. Individual debs per plugin are a nice idea, but then we have to 
do the same thing for RPMs, Windows, Mac users and so on, plus we either 
package each plugin by hand or try to automate the whole thing. And the 
plugins aren't really designed to be built without the server build 
being there, and so on. It gets messy quickly.

So the new plan is to rearrange things so that all the official plugins 
end up bundled along with the server in a standard way for all 
packaging, and we ship a tool that lets you turn them on or off. 
However, I don't have a date for when this will happen, but it is being 
worked on.

Cheers, Simon
