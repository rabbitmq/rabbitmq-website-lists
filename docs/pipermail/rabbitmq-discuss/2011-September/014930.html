<PRE>Coming back to this after a day I realize throughout I was a bit off in describing my situation. I am actually attempting to get an asynchronous setup to work on one connection to the RabbitMQ server.

Connect, create a channel(s), publish to a queue, then monitor on the reply queue, in an asynchronous state, returning the reply to a web page when completed.

</I>&gt;<i>         self.callback_queue = result.method.queue
</I>
Synchronous methods in AMQP return data. This data is captured
under 'result.method'.
result.method.queue contains a fresh, unique, exclusive queue name
that was just created.

&gt;<i> Line 13 declares the result variable as the product of the channel getting
</I>&gt;<i> an exclusive queue created, which I get. However the part that I get caught
</I>&gt;<i> up in is where the callback is set to result.method.queue in line 14. What
</I>&gt;<i> exactly is the method.queue of the result object?
</I>
If you're interested in other fields under 'result.method' please take a look
at amqp spec, for example results of queue-declare are under queue-declare-ok
method: <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#queue.declare-ok">http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#queue.declare-ok</A>

&gt;<i> I am hoping to simply

</I>&gt;<i> publish/monitor without creating 2 connections. My current attempt at simply
</I>&gt;<i> using one connection with 2 channels does not seem to be operating how I
</I>&gt;<i> expected.
</I>
The problem is that RPC client does only listen for messages when
there is an RPC call running. So, you won't be able to get 'realtime'
data from other things that are hanging on the same connection.
You may hear the results only during the rpc call.

Cheers,
  Marek
