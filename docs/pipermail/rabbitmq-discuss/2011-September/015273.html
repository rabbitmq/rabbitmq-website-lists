<PRE>Hi Jonathan,

&gt;<i> &quot;In addition, when processing &quot;please log out this user&quot; messages, a
</I>&gt;<i> machine should *not* acknowledge that it has received the message
</I>&gt;<i> until after it publishes its response (this way, if the machine dies
</I>&gt;<i> while processing, the sender will get a basic.return for it).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am I correct in understanding from this that, in the direct exchange
</I>&gt;<i> context, I can control when the consumer machine sends back its ack,
</I>&gt;<i> by calling something like basicAck at some point in the consumption/
</I>&gt;<i> delivery code?
</I>
The exchange type has nothing to do with it.  When you consume from a
queue, you specify the autoAck parameter.  If this is set to true
(which it is, by default), then the server will not wait for the
consumer to acknowledge receipt of the message (so, it's effectively
auto-ack'ing all messages).  If it's set to false, the broker will not
consider the message delivered to the consumer until it explicitly ack's
the message.  See the API guide for an example (I assume you're using
the Java client, but the other clients have very similar APIs):
  <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#consuming">http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#consuming</A>

&gt;<i> If so, I would expect that I could skip the return
</I>&gt;<i> publishing (i.e., the response) from the consumer to the producer and
</I>&gt;<i> simply check confirms and confirms + basic.returns for each message
</I>&gt;<i> sent directly to each machine. Moreover, if, prior to publishing, I
</I>&gt;<i> associate the machine (or direct queue corresponding to it) to the
</I>&gt;<i> message to be sent, I should be able to find out which machines
</I>&gt;<i> present which form of response (i.e., confirm or confirm +
</I>&gt;<i> basic.return). Does this make sense or am I still reading too much
</I>&gt;<i> into the consumer ack (such that, for example, the confirmation
</I>&gt;<i> received by the publisher just represents the handoff of the message
</I>&gt;<i> to the queue and not its uptake by the consumer)?
</I>
Oh.  I missed that.  Yes, I think that would work.

Cheers,
Alex

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not really, no. &#160;I don't think there's anyway to get what you want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automatically.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2. If not, is there any way (apart from the admin HTTP API) for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; determining the number of consumers (e.g., bound queues) for a given
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; exchange? This way I could test the number of reply messages as you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; suggest; otherwise, with needing to register and account for a dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; array of servers, I would lose a good deal of what I had hoped would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be the benefit of a fanout broadcast.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's no AMQP way of finding how many queues are bound to an exchange.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As you say, there's the management API, but using that is likely to lead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to races (what happens if you query the number of queues, then one of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the machines dies before it sends its acknowledgement?).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You could kind of get what you want with AMQP. &#160;Use a fanout exchange
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like you want for broadcast messages, but use a direct exchange for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; direct communication between machines. &#160;You could use the fanout
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exchange to make sure that all the machines know about each other (in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particular, that each knows the queues the others bound to the direct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exchange, so that they can communicate directly). &#160;And you could use the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; direct exchange to publish persistent, confirm, mandatory, immediate messages
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directly to other machines. &#160;With these messages, the sender will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; notified if the other machine received the message (only a confirm is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; received for the publish), or if the other machine went offline in the past
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (a basic.return and a confirm is received). &#160;This way, the sending
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine would know which other machines received its message and, so,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will know to wait for the correct number of responses. &#160;The queue bound
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the direct exchange would have to be durable, auto-delete for this to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work (durable for confirms to work and auto-delete so that once the sole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consumer dies, the queue is deleted and publishing to it will result in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a basic.return). &#160;In addition, when processing &quot;please log out this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user&quot; messages, a machine should *not* acknowledge that it has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; received the message until after it publishes its response (this way, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the machine dies while processing, the sender will get a basic.return for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hope this helps.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My expectation, then, is that producer would publish its message and

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Confirms mean one thing and one thing only: that the broker has accepted

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; They concern the interaction between producers and the broker, and &#160;have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; nothing to do with consumer acks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, there are some conditions in which a consumer ack can trigger a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; confirm in RabbitMQ, but that is an implementation detail and not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; something you'd want to design an application around.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My hope is that I will not have to aggregate a list of servers and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pass along a single message to each server, but perhaps that is what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be required.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; You can still send a single message via a fanout exchange. But the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; consumers then in turn need to send a message back to the sender. Your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; sender will need to know how many consumers there are so it knows when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; it has gotten all responses..
