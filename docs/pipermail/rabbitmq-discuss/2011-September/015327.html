rpm only recognises things being installed if they were installed via 
rpm - otherwise they're just a bunch of files on the disk as far as it's 
concerned.

Ideally you would install Erlang from rpms too; see the instructions 
under &quot;RPM-based Linux&quot; at <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/server.html.">http://www.rabbitmq.com/server.html.</A> But 
having seen your post on the AWS forums I don't think that works due to 
the standard Amazon Linux not having various UI libraries and the Erlang 
package being compiled to depend on them.

So I think you have a few options:

* Install RabbitMQ from the generic Unix tarball rather than RPM.

Downsides: you'll need to fiddle around to get it running as a service; 
nothing will be done for you.

* Keep tracking down rpms until all dependencies are satisfied.

Downsides: sounds like a pain.

* Tell rpm to install RabbitMQ anyway (with I think --nodeps or similar)

Downsides: you're telling rpm to ignore the dependency information it 
has. Inelegant, to say the least.

* Start again with an AMI of CentOS or (better still IMNSHO) Debian / 
Ubuntu.

Downsides: you have to start again.

If it were me I'd do the last one.

Cheers, Simon
