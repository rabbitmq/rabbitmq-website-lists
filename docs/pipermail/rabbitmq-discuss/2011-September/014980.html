Channels do increase over time. They start at 386 and grow to 445 by the 
time I hit the high memory mark. Despite the fact that that number does 
grow, it doesn't SEEM unreasonable.

</I>Unfortunately, I'm unable to send the output of that. But I did generate it. 
Is there anything in particular I should be looking for? I looked through it 
and I don't see anything that looks out of the ordinary, at least as far as 
I'm concerned :)

It reports that rabbit is using about 70G of memory (which is where the high 
watermark is set), I think around 20G are used by 'processes' and another 
40G+ are used by 'binary' I think?

I never mentioned what versions I'm using:

RabbitMQ: 2.5.1
Erlang: R14B03
Spring AMQP: 1.0.0.RC2

I was previously using R13B03 (or 04) and that displayed the problem much 
faster and additionally would crash RabbitMQ when I started hitting that 
watermark -- probably because I had it set so high (0.75). Using R14B03, I 
can survive much much longer and rabbit no longer crashes. It just sits 
there blocking producers, waiting for consumers to consume, yet there's 
nothing to consume!
