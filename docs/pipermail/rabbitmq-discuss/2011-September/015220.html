Hi Matthew,

Well, your interpretation would be a good solution as well.

I have currently setup the shovelling of messages from one of our client
servers to our end via SSL. Everything works beautifully when you first
start the servers. However, over time (2-3 days) messages just seem to
get lost in transit. I have setup shovel to do transactional forwards so
as to ascertain that the messages are indeed getting delivered. When I
look at the client side server it does not show any piled up messages
(making me believe that the messages are indeed getting forwarded
properly). However, at our end there are no messages getting delivered
and the queues are empty. When I look at the connections list (using the
management plugin) I can see that the connection is still active. The
only solution I have found so far is to restart both the servers so that
the shovel connections get recycled.

Restarting the servers can be a hassle sometimes since we have multiple
client servers connecting to the same servers at our end. It is only
recently that I have started using the shovel plugin. Earlier we had
just written a shovelling application ourselves which used to perform
the consume-publish operation but wasn't as flexible or featureful as
the shovel plugin.

So, what I was thinking was to put may be an option in the shovel
configuration (something like &quot;recycle_connection&quot;) so that we can force
a connection recycle every few days (ideally I would like to do it every
24-36 hrs). The whole point of restarting the servers is so that the
connections get recycled. So if there was a way in the plugin itself to
do this, the whole server won't need a restart.

Regards,
Mihir
