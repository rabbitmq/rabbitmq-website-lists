<PRE>The scenario I'm looking at, is someone accidentally / inadvertently / deliberately deleting the messages from the queue.  I want to be able to take a snapshot of the messages that are in a particular queue and put them somewhere else on disk outside of RabbitMQ.  Then if someone/something does delete the messages, I want to be able to restore them.

Having the messages replicated on multiple nodes goes someway towards mitigating the risk, but it doesn't stop someone accidentally clearing out multiple queues.

</I>&gt;<i> The queue specific thing would be to cluster two or more RabbitMQ brokers and set a High Availability policy on the queue so that all its messages are replicated to the other node(s). If the primary node crashes, one of the replicas will take over and you won't loose any messages (that have already been written to disk). Take a look at <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html</A> for more details.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If your network is potentially unreliable (i.e., network partitions are quite likely) then you might want to consider using a federated exchange instead. This will perform the replication for you (i.e., copy messages from the exchange to another node(s) as per your configuration/policy) and the receiving node will effectively have a backup of all the data sent to the original exchange. I'd go for HA if you've got a reliable network though, since for your use-case it is ideal.
