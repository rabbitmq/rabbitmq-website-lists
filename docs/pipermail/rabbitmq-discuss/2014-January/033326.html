<PRE>Hi, Bertrand...

On Thu, Jan 23, 2014 at 12:54 AM, Bertrand LEMASLE &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">blemasle at allocine.fr</A>&gt;wrote:

My apologies... I confess I misread your original report by skimming over
the meaty part of it and reading what I expected to see rather than what
you in fact wrote.

After some digging, I discovered that my producer and consumer run on the
&gt;<i> same thread but they souldn't (for now, producer and consumer run in the
</I>&gt;<i> same application). So my consumer thread sleep affects my publisher thread.
</I>&gt;<i> That's obviously a flaw in my own design and seems to have nothing to do
</I>&gt;<i> with RabbitMQ itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your concern and your clarification about publisher confirms
</I>&gt;<i> which made me think about monitoring running threads and so came onto this !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ah, gotcha!  Glad you found an external to Rabbit cause for the weird
behavior.

When Matthias pointed out my carelessness in misreading your original
message I made a note to come back to your report and try to reproduce your
observations, but knew I wouldn't be able to get to it for a couple of
days.

The behavior you were describing was indeed surprising to us (when I became
less daft and actually grasped what you were saying), as it was to you.

Again, my apologies for my sloppiness and adding confusion to the situation.

Best regards,
Jerry
