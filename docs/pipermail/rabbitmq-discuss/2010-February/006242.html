<PRE>Hey Dieter,

1) The php-amqp library does not have any &quot;consume&quot; method, and as far as I could tell, nothing else that could serve as a replacement. The publishing side was fast, but without the ability to read from the queue, it was useless to us. I did some reconnaissance to determine how much work it would take to port something over but my C was far too rusty to write something that worked in production.
2) The &quot;php-rabbit is bug ridden&quot; statement stemmed from the typos (AQPM instead of AMQP) and the fact that the module would not load due to an improper DEFINE. If the owner hadn't compiled it and tested it, I felt safe in assuming there were more issues down the road.

After Alexandre asked me for some demos, I went back and tried to generate a sample script detailing the bug I was encountering (all exchanges were being declared and 'direct' and I couldn't publish). After plodding through the code and fixing the fucntion signatures and improper dereferencing, I think I have something that works, but I haven't had a chance to fully vet it (Super Bowl.) Let me see if I can't get it working, and I will keep the list informed of my progress.

Pieter

	Hi everyone,
	
	We are having some issues here with PHP clients. We have the following options:
	Php-amqp (PHP module written in C)
	Php-rabbit (PHP module written in C)
	AMQP (Pure PHP implementation, which is a port of port)
	
	The pure PHP implementation is working for us, but it is too slow to really serve our purposes. As a result, we are looking at the PHP modules.
	After doing some patching thanks to madcoder on Google groups, the php-amqp library works well, but does not have consumer functionality. The php-rabbit module is unfortunately bug ridden.

Hi Pieter, hi @all

I lost the track to the answers to your message. 
What does it mean, &quot;it lacks the consumer functionality&quot; ?

Did You find a solution for the php-client? 
Can you provide a link to the patched PHP module from madcoder? 
Can I use it in production?

It would be cool if you can tell us (me) which bugs you ran into, so we could propably help to fix some of them and get a working library.

We tried using the Pure PHP-AMQP Library and we also discovered that's too slow for our scenario.

Greetings,

Dieter
