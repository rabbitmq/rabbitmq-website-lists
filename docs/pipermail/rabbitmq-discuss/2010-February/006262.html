<PRE>Hi

According to the rabbit .Net client documentation,QueueingBasicConsumer
is the safest way of subscribing to a queue, because its
implementation uses RabbitMQ.Util.SharedQueue to pass deliveries over to
the application thread,where all processing of received deliveries is
done, and where any AMQP IModel operation is safe.

But, when I checked the sourcecode it is just accumulating the messages
on a shared queue and doesn't route the messages to application thread.
So when iam using the QueueingBasicConsumer, the messages arrive on the
rabbit thread and processed on the same thread.

Is this some thing already known or left to the users to implement.

Thanks
Rajesh
