</I>&gt;<i> the identity of the real user who connected to Broker1?
</I>
The shovel is nothing more than a (slightly fancy) client. Thus the
shovel must authenticate to both brokers just like a normal client
would. Thus each broker is still its own administrative domain, and is
responsible for validating clients.

&gt;<i> It would make sense to use the identity of the real user but in this
</I>&gt;<i> case the shovel must be a special connection, allowing the source to
</I>&gt;<i> tag messages with the identity of the user who produced the messages,
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. JMSXUserID in the JMS world.
</I>
Messages that are received by a client have no information in them by
default as to who sent them or what user credentials were used when the
publisher connected to the broker.

&gt;<i> Reading the RabbitMQ-shovel documentation, it seems that the plugin
</I>&gt;<i> does not need to run on one end of the link. So maybe you could shovel
</I>&gt;<i> from Broker1 to Broker2 but run the plugin on Broker3. A kind of
</I>&gt;<i> man-in-the middle attack...
</I>
Yes, you can definitely do that. However, it's not a MitM attack on the
grounds that the shovel can't steal messages from Broker1 any more
easily than any other client can.
