 &gt; Well, O(log(branching rate for the tree)) (you need to do key lookups at
 &gt; each level), but near enough.

Right. However, in ideal case you'll use hash table for the lookup which 
will get the average case down to a constant.

 &gt;&gt; and O(n) time where n is length of the longest subscription.
 &gt;&gt; Such an algorithm can be turned on by a specific hint passed to
 &gt;&gt; Exchange.Create 'arguments' parameter, or, more transparently, it
 &gt;&gt; can be used as long as subscriptions adhere to &quot;x.y.z.#&quot; pattern and
 &gt;&gt; once there's a non-compliant subscription, matching algorithm can
 &gt;&gt; switch dynamically to a more generic one.
 &gt;
 &gt; I'm not sure this actually needs quite such specific logic. It should 
be possible
 &gt; to add rules which means this behaviour falls out naturally rather 
than having a sharp transition between the two behaviours e.g. in the 
NFA approach suggested the only special handling needed would be to make 
sure that binding the pattern # was sensibly implemented as a &quot;go 
straight to queue, do not pass go, do not collect O(key length) 
operations&quot; node rather than doing a full scan of the rest
 &gt;  of the key.

Ack.

 &gt; 'though I guess that sparks another question: How long are the keys 
people are
 &gt; actually using with this?

My experience from stock trading sphere is that most keys are 3-5 items 
long, the longest being somewhere in the range of 15-20 items.
