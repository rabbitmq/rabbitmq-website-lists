<PRE>Hi Matthias,

That's good to know that those numbers look high to you.  Knowing where our
bounds are will help me readjust out configuration.

We have ~75 bindings, same as the number of queues.  We don't do many
multiple bindings per queue (if any).  This has increased faster than our
message volumes (more consuming applications to make use of the data), so I
believe this is the primary reason things are harder now than they used to
be.

Unfortunately, moving to a direct exchange is in the works but not a quick
for us at this point.

What I would like to figure out is how to reorient my cluster to make things
more stable.  Knowing that the routing time is increasing due to the number
of bindings, I am not convinced that my plan of adding a rabbitmq node to
each producer is going to make things all that much better - the routing
table will still be the same, and it will need to do that cross-routing
you're talking about avoiding.  Even when we have a single producer catching
up in our current system, the node can only route at a certain rate, and
this is definitely not CPU bound.  I am curious why Erlang cannot spend more
time in that thread, but I don't know much about it - does that seem right
to you?

I am not sure what I can do to minimize cross-routing, other than to try to
keep our producers consolidated and keep the heaviest consumers (meaning the
ones with a binding to the most active topics - remember that all queues
bind to only one topic expression) separated on their own nodes, to remove
their queue management processing on the core routing function.  Ironically,
I was originally trying to keep the heaviest consumers on the routing nodes,
to minimize forwarding of messages - but if the cost magnifies with the
number of consumer queues, then it's likely that keeping the larger fanout
(but smaller throughput) of consumers on the routing nodes might be best.

The thing that concerns me is that my scalability here seems to be limited -
the only other thing I can think of doing is increasing my number of
producers to distribute the load even further and possibly do the local node
thing - then if our routing table keeps growing, I can manage scaling at the
producer level - not efficient maybe, but at least it can grow past the
threshold I appear to be running into.

Thanks for the background.  I would love to see more documentation on how
the process model works.  Let me know if the above triggers any other
solutions.

Thanks,
Brian
