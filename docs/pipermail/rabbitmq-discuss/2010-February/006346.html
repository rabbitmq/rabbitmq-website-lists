</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; They should do the same thing. This one is very odd - it looks like tcp
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; listeners are being started as the Erlang VM kernel is being shutdown.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I've never seen this before, but I'd be slightly surprised if it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; unique to 21673. Can you reproduce this at all on the default branch?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately no. To be honest, everything works fine on small loads. We
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using that branch for very large loads where the number of tasks don't
</I>&gt;<i> fit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into memory. So while the problem itself may not be specific to this
</I>&gt;<i> branch,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't seen this problem in the default branch because the default
</I>&gt;<i> can't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handle the loads we're generating.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. We have another suspicion, that you may be stopping rabbit with
</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmqctl stop_app and then using something in /etc/init.d to start
</I>&gt;<i> Rabbit. stop_app only stops the rabbit application running within the
</I>&gt;<i> Erlang VM. It doesn't stop the erlang VM itself. Hence the difference
</I>&gt;<i> between rabbitmqctl stop and rabbitmqctl stop_app. Could that be what's
</I>&gt;<i> going on?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't think so. I haven't been using that command on these machines. But
it's possible someone else tried running that command without telling me :)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Also, which version of Erlang are you running? 12B3 is the minimum for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that branch, and 13B03 is recommended.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 12B-4 is what we're building from source. What benefits would we get from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; upgrading to 13B03?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thousands of bug fixes, and a much better GC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Great.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Btw, are there any special rabbitmq/erlang commands or tools we can run
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; verify that rabbimq is healthy beyond running rabbitmqctl and looking at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; logs? I find the logs rather cryptic sometimes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Generally, provided something like rabbitmqctl list_queues is
</I>&gt;<i> responsive, all is well. If that starts taking several seconds to
</I>&gt;<i> respond then Rabbit's under heavy load, but that doesn't mean anything's
</I>&gt;<i> going wrong, just that it's got a lot to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've always written Rabbit very defensively - if it starts to go wrong,
</I>&gt;<i> it'll explode hard, quickly. So in general, if it's up and running and
</I>&gt;<i> doing something, then it's usually quite happy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok good to know.

thanks,
Scott
