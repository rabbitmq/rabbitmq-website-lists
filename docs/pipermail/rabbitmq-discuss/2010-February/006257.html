<PRE>Matthias,

2010/2/8 Matthias Radestock &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">matthias at lshift.net</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> That indicates that the client closed the connection. Or the network died.
</I>
Yep; I also reached that conclusion.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I used to have immediate and mandatory flags set but I've removed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these to make the connection as plain vanilla as possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With these flags set the server may send 'basic.return' commands to the
</I>&gt;<i> client. Perhaps amqplib doesn't handle these and dies?
</I>

As the problem manifests itself with a plain connection this is not likely
to be the cause.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also note that the frame size does not limit the message size, since
</I>&gt;<i> messages can be split across multiple frames. All our supported client
</I>&gt;<i> libraries do that automatically but it's possible that amqplib doesn't.
</I>

I've found out that pika takes the min() of the server-mandated framesize
(128k) and the one I specified in the ConnectionParameters() meaning that I
cannot set a larger frame-size.

&gt;<i>From reviewing the pika &amp; amqplib code it seems that:
</I>- pika takes the header/footer sizes into account when computing the
frame-max to use
- pika actually writes in frame-max blocks, which I don't believe amqplib
does. Not sure yet whether this could cause the issue observed.

When I finish translating my threaded amqplib app into pika using asyncore I
hope to find that it solves the problem.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Try to get a trace that includes the connection disappearance. The pattern
</I>&gt;<i> of commands just prior to that might shed some light on what causes the
</I>&gt;<i> client to trip up.
</I>

Tracer writes the full message-body to stdout which isn't helpful when
sending multi-megabyte bodies. I'll try using wireshark for diagnostics
instead.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to give it a try, but since we do not know what the problem is
</I>&gt;<i> there is no way to tell in advance whether it will fare any better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the design principles of pika, but the example of demo_relay.py is a
</I>little hard going. Can you point me at any other real-world examples of
asyncore-based connection handling? And what is the recommended way to
detect/handle connection-failure?

Regards,

Sigurd
