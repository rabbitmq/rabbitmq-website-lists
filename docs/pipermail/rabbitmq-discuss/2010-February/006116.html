<PRE>Thanks for forwarding that to the list, Holger.

Vladimir, we have sometimes seen very strange things with Windows and
some firewall products doing deep inspection on traffic that's going to
the internet at large - XML based content often triggers this. Could you
make sure all firewalls are off, or try using SSL?

You don't state which client you're using. If you can cut the code down
to a small example which demonstrates this problem we can certainly take
a look at that.

We know of several clients who are publishing to Rabbit at high speed
over a WAN - there is nothing inherently tricky here.

I have a suspicion this is a firewall issue - with your simple
streaming, do I assume the data is all nulls, or random? And with your
Rabbit tests, is the data XML?
