I've just done some testing and found that removing our settings and
relying on the OS to set them does not, in any case I can come up with,
improve performance. I'm curious - you've said that you always set them
to 65536, and there certainly seems to be evidence that that helps over
WANs. But what about with no explicit setting of sndbuf and recbuf over
WANs. Is the performance the same as manually setting to 65536, or the
same as our explicit defaults, or something else?

Many thanks,

Matthew
