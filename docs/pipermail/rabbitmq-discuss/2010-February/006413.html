<PRE>The rabbitmq-codegen module is generic code used by all the specific language libraries. For example, rabbitmq-server and rabbitmq-c both have different &quot;codegen.py&quot; modules in them which use amqp_codegen.py to parse and preprocess the specification definitions.

So for rabbitmq-c, just as one example,

    hg clone <A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-codegen">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-codegen</A>
    hg clone <A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-c">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-c</A>
    (cd rabbitmq-c; autoreconf -i)
    (cd rabbitmq-c; ./configure)

and then

    make -C rabbitmq-c/librabbitmq amqp_framing.h amqp_framing.c

Take a look at rabbitmq-c/librabbitmq/codegen.py to get a feel for what the various language-specific codegens are doing.

Regards,
  Tony


Thanks, I'll look into that.
