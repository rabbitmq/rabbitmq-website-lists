Followup reply from Vladimir. Apparently the problem is something else.
Any of the Rabbit devs got an idea?

Holger, thank you a lot for reply.

We are tried to use different send/receive buffers (from 8kb to 16 Mb),
but it don't improve performance. We saw extremely large throughput
until buffer is filled (when use 1 Mb buffer we can send about 1 Mb data
with no delay, when use 256 kB buffer we can send about 256 kB, etc) but
then we see poor performance again - no more than 20 kB/s. We have
tested with Windows XP and Windows Vista.

Also we have created a simple client-server application which simply
writes data to stream and measure performance: we have seen throughput
is about 350 kB/s (it is about 40% of network usage, what is a pretty
good for us, because we can use three or four connections on this
network to arrive at least 90% of network usage). We don't understand
why RabbitMQ have poor performance using single TCP connection on our case.
