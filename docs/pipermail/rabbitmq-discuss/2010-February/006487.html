Closing the channel will result in all unacknowledged messages getting 
requeued, so no messages will be lost.

Another option is to cancel the consumer before initiating the recover. 
The sequence of client actions would be something like this:
1) send basic.cancel
2) wait for basic.cancel-ok
3) send basic.recover
4) send basic.consume

The hook for step 2 is provided by overriding the handleCancelOk method 
on the consumer class.

Note that the basic.recover in step 3 can by async or sync - it doesn't 
matter.

While waiting for the basic.cancel-ok in step 2 you have a choice of 
either continuing to process and ack messages, or throw them away and 
let the server resend them to the client as part of the recovery.


Regards,

Matthias.
