Right. We have another suspicion, that you may be stopping rabbit with
rabbitmqctl stop_app and then using something in /etc/init.d to start
Rabbit. stop_app only stops the rabbit application running within the
Erlang VM. It doesn't stop the erlang VM itself. Hence the difference
between rabbitmqctl stop and rabbitmqctl stop_app. Could that be what's
going on?

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, which version of Erlang are you running? 12B3 is the minimum for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that branch, and 13B03 is recommended.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 12B-4 is what we're building from source. What benefits would we get from
</I>&gt;<i> upgrading to 13B03?
</I>
Thousands of bug fixes, and a much better GC.

&gt;<i> Btw, are there any special rabbitmq/erlang commands or tools we can run to
</I>&gt;<i> verify that rabbimq is healthy beyond running rabbitmqctl and looking at
</I>&gt;<i> logs? I find the logs rather cryptic sometimes.
</I>
Generally, provided something like rabbitmqctl list_queues is
responsive, all is well. If that starts taking several seconds to
respond then Rabbit's under heavy load, but that doesn't mean anything's
going wrong, just that it's got a lot to do.

We've always written Rabbit very defensively - if it starts to go wrong,
it'll explode hard, quickly. So in general, if it's up and running and
doing something, then it's usually quite happy.

Matthew
