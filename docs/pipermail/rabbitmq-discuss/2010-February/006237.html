<PRE>Hi,

We are using the .NET client and the heartbeat is set to 60 sec for the
connection. We are getting the following exception some times and the
client losses the connection.

AMQP Connection closed. Initiator:Peer Reason:CONNECTION_FORCED - broker
forced connection closure with reason 'shutdown'

Could this be because of delay in processing of messages at the
subscriber's end.

Thanks
Rajesh
