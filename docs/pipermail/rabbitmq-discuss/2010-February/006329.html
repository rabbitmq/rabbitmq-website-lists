&gt;<i> I cannot find any code here - do you know where it is?
</I>
When I did a subversion checkout form there all I got was an empty directory. So it looks like it's a WIP and currently hasn't been updated.

I'm also considering looking at a C++ interface to Rabbit as we use systems written in Java, C# and C++ simultaneously and a common messaging interface would be good. I don't really fancy trying to wrap a COM interface around the rabbit.net libraries to make them work with (MS) C++
