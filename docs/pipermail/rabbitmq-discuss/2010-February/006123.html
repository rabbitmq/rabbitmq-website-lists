<PRE>Ben,

Firstly, I made a mistake in my previous post - it's 24 *words*, not
bytes. Sorry!

It'll degrade. If you use topic exchanges then it can degrade linearly
(which needn't be the case - we have bugs open to fix this), but if you
use a direct exchange then it'll be O(log_2 N) as the bindings are
indexable by a b-tree.

</I>
Yes. I would not recommend that you keep bindings around which are not
used for long periods of time if they impact the performance of the
system overall. It depends on what kind of throughput you're needing to
achieve.
