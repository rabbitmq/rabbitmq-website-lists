Indeed the frames do all arrive intact and in that order. But that is 
all happening within the context of a specific channel and in a specific 
direction, i.e. client-to-server or server-to-client.

&gt;<i> the next paragraph on that page implied that there might be an

</I>&gt;<i> information, but i could not make out any command which could be sent 
</I>&gt;<i> proactively to actually have the described effect without additional 
</I>&gt;<i> disruption. what kind of termination was this passage intended to imply?
</I>
No idea, and note that the paragraph refers to *aborting* the sending of 
content, not terminating, so it wouldn't help in what you are trying to do.

&gt;<i> i had read the last paragraph of 3.1.1 on page 26 to limit, if not 
</I>&gt;<i> preclude, the actions which you describe. yes, there is a possible 
</I>&gt;<i> conflict between that paragraph and the passage at the close of 4.2.6.2 
</I>&gt;<i> on page 36, but the &quot;MUST NOT&quot;s in the earlier passage are neither 
</I>&gt;<i> lightweight nor contingent stipulations, and, as demonstrated, the 
</I>&gt;<i> practice most certainly removes information.
</I>
The content bodies referred to in section 3.1.1. refer to logical AMQP 
method content, not any particular chunking of it into content frames.


Regards,

Matthias.
