<PRE>good morning;

thank you for clarifying.

that is to say, page-52/line-38 and the diagrams at page-52/line32  
and page-53/line-11 of amqp8-0.pdf are no more a misrepresentation of  
&quot;accordingly&quot; for a purported r8.0 broker than the indication in  
`amqp-xml-doc0-8.pdf` that it applies to &quot;AMQ Protocol (major=10,  
minor=3)&quot;?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NB: the correct protocol header for 0-9-1 is in fact AMQP 0-0-9-1,

cool.
hmmm... what does the ampq 1-1-9-1 protocol header from the r8.0 and  
the r9.1 specs actually mean?
is that what you intended, above, with &quot;AMQP 0-0-9-1&quot;?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b. it does not use the 8-byte frame headers which appear in every   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instance of the amqp0-8 specification the net had yielded, but  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather  7-byte headers that are specified for 9-1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All implementations of 0-8 actually use a 7-byte header. Hence the  
</I>&gt;<i> correction in 0-9-1.
</I>
do these two sentences boggle any other minds?
a naive reader of the r8.0 specification might misconstrue it to  
require, that such a correction would apply to a broker which  
purports to follow the r9.1 spec, but not to broker which purports to  
follow the r8.0 spec. in this light, i have rescanned the r8.0 spec,  
but did not observe any formulations of the order &quot;or any later  
protocol version.&quot; ok. anyway, i gather that page-35/line-26 and  
page-53/line-29 of amqp8-0.pdf are history. is there anything else of  
which a naive implementor should be aware?

? is there an amqp8-0-bis.pdf which describes the protocol which  
nominal r8.0 brokers purport to follow?

? is there a document which describes the protocol which the rabbitmq  
broker purports to follows?

? the rabbitmq site did yield a description[1] of r8.0 to r9.1. it  
might make sense were at least that document to indicate differences  
between r8.0  as specified and as implemented. If one is to follow  
this line from that differences document,

  &quot;Framing and connection establishment (modulo the removed frame- 
types and the spec version number advertisement, respectively) are  
identical.&quot;

literally rather than respective the specification texts, and if  
there is to be no revision to the r8.0 specification document, there  
would be some value to taking amqp8-0.pdf down, as it requires  
evidently false performance.

? are there actually any r9.0 brokers in the wild?

on a meta level: how does this community achieve interoperability,  
other by knowing each other's code?
