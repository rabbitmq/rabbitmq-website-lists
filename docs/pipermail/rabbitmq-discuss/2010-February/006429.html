Ah, that makes sense. Thanks.

Well, O(log(branching rate for the tree)) (you need to do key lookups at
each level), but near enough. 

&gt;<i> and O(n) time where n is length of the longest subscription.
</I>&gt;<i> Such an algorithm can be turned on by a specific hint passed to

I'm not sure this actually needs quite such specific logic. It should be possible
to add rules which means this behaviour falls out naturally rather than having a 
sharp transition between the two behaviours e.g. in the NFA approach suggested 
the only special handling needed would be to make sure that binding the pattern 
# was sensibly implemented as a &quot;go straight to queue, do not pass go, do not 
collect O(key length) operations&quot; node rather than doing a full scan of the rest
 of the key.

'though I guess that sparks another question: How long are the keys people are
actually using with this?
