<PRE>Hi Tony,

First let me thank you for answering this on a vacation.

1. What do you mean by full Connection? Should I create a completely separate socket per thread? Or does it mean AMQP level connection?
2. If it is AMQP level connection, I have tried that before but it did not seem to work. I can try again if you feel it should work.
3. If it is completely separate socket, that is separate socket for each consumer and producer I seem to land in interaction between nagle and delayed ack which is playing havoc with response times. Disabling nagle does not help. 
4. If I share a (single socket + AMQP connection) between one producer and one consumer each on a different thread in same application using different channels seem to give best results. But in this configuration total message throughput that I can achieve with a reasonable latency (sub millisecond) on 1 KB message size is around 1000/sec. This throughput is somewhat restrictive.
5. Of course I can use multiple &quot;pairs&quot; of such consumers and producers to scale up but from the application point of view producers and consumers are not really paired, that is one application instance will have m producers and n consumers.

As you said, the library is not designed to work with pthreaded applications and possibly won't really work for our application at the end. I am just trying to see much can we do with this as I don't have any alternative at the moment.

Regards,
Dinabandhu
