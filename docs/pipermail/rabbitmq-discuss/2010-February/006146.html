Our sndbuf setting actually is the same as gets reported by Erlang by 
default on the systems I've tried - 16k. OTOH, the recbuf setting of 4k 
is significantly smaller than the 85k Erlang reports by default.

As I mentioned before, I tried to minimise per-connection memory usage. 
So the figures are the lowest I could find that showed good performance 
in my tests.

But yes, I'd rather stick to the defaults too. See below.

Depends what you are running on. A linksys slug - the smallest device 
we've run rabbit on - can quite happily handle thousands of connections, 
but not if they each take up &gt;100k off memory.

OTOH, if you are running rabbit under extreme conditions then perhaps 
it's not too much to ask for some manual parameter tweaking.

So I think we should investigate sticking to the defaults, and let users 
tweak the settings when they need to. That's also what decided to do in 
the client libraries.


Matthias.
