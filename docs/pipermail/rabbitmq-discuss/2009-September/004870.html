I am not sure how you got that impression. I am not using AMQP on the client
side. I never mentioned it like that. iPhone is the client. AMQP (RabbitMQ)
is installed in our server.

Here it is...

iPhone app -&gt; socket server -&gt; RabbitMQ server

iPhone app has some social networking features in addition to the chat
component. Think of it like mini-facebook inside iPhone. When a user types a
message inside chat window of iPhone app, the message travels to Socket
server which directs the message depending on what is on the message header.
If the message header says &quot;this message is for RabbitMQ&quot;, socket server
will route to RabbitMQ. When a message comes from RabbitMQ to socket server,
it should have message header that says &quot;Route this to xxxxxx user&quot;. Then,
socket server will route the message to appropriate user(s).

It all looks good, but it doesn't work. Because I don't know how to make a
call to RabbitMQ using the message from socket server and how to pass the
message from RabbitMQ to socket server in binary format.

Thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;Alex, you haven't explained why your app can only send a specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;binary stream to a socket - for intents and purposes AMQP is no more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;than a *stream* of binary data.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am not sure. It's not a specific binary stream, it can be any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; binary data. But, this binary data can't be interpreted by RabbitMQ
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unless I put another middle layer to translate this into call to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; RabbitMQ.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;I don't know how the network event notification works in iPhone OS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3.x
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;(i.e. I don't know whether you get it to pre-empt the phone's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kernel).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Actually it's not related to iPhone. I was mentioning about polling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mechanism in RabbitMQ. Meaning that, RabbitMQ doesn't inform the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user when he gets the message. User has to check every few seconds
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to see if there is anything in his queue. So, iPhone app (OR any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application for that matter) needs to constantly check RabbitMQ to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see if there is any message. That's going to cost lot of bandwidth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when I port the app to mobile devices.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you for all the answers.
