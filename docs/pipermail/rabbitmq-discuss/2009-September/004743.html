<PRE>Hi Anthony,

</I>
That's right. Individual client libraries need to be altered to cope
with unsolicited &quot;channel.flow&quot; messages.

&gt;<i>    2. Besides rabbit noticing when a TCP connection dies - is there any

</I>&gt;<i>       that would actually test whether or not a connection is active,
</I>
Yes, there's a heartbeat parameter negotiated as part of the
&quot;connection.tune&quot;/&quot;connection.tune-ok&quot; sequence at connection startup.
It's pretty loosely defined, but basically if there's no activity for N
seconds, a peer may decide the connection has collapsed and may close
the socket.

&gt;<i>       and if it isn't, kill the relevant queues?
</I>
This is independently controllable: if the queues were marked exclusive
when declared (see the spec's documentation around &quot;queue.declare&quot;),
then when the connection goes, so will the queues. Autodelete works
similarly, but at consumer granularity rather than connection granularity.

&gt;<i> Do I as the person who
</I>&gt;<i>       monitors the server configure this, or do the programmers who
</I>&gt;<i>       write our clients need to incorporate something into their code?
</I>
Interesting question. The server at the moment does not have a mechanism
for suggesting the use of a heartbeat to its clients: it is up to
clients to configure the heartbeats they feel they need. This could be
changed, a little, so that the server could suggest a value, but the
clients would still be free to override the server's suggestion.

Negotiation in AMQP is a bit screwed up, to be honest: most of the
protocol is great, but negotiation is a bit weak. TELNET has the right
idea here!

Regards,
  Tony
