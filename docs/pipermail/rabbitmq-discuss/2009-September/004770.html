<PRE>Ben,


&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Is it hard to set up RabbitMQ for single machine use?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't have thought so. There are packages for a variety of
</I>&gt;<i> penguins as well as windows. It's quite a straightforward process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Planning to use Ubuntu Server, so I will use their packages.

More concerned with configuration, than installation.  Is it a big deal?



&gt;<i> &gt; 2) I see there are a few AMQP projects for python.  What should I use?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of people on this list seem to prefer Barry's library for it's
</I>&gt;<i> simplicity but YMMV. Some people prefer txAMQP because they're running
</I>&gt;<i> stuff in a reactor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That's ampqlib, right?

 

&gt;<i> &gt; Each task unit is less than 1kb and I don't intend for the queue to be allowed 
</I>&gt;<i> to grow than ~200 task units long.  At that point, I have the task producer set 
</I>&gt;<i> to pause and wait until the queue goes down.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Without a back channel, how is the producer going to know about the queue depth?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The one-and-only producer, I had thought, would do something like sleep for a few seconds, query the queue size, and if it's getting low, generate a new block of tasks.

Is this not advisable in RabbitMQ based systems?


&gt;<i> &gt; I do want to be able to flag certain tasks as &quot;dependant&quot;, so that a certain 
</I>&gt;<i> task must be marked &quot;done&quot; before it's dependent can can run.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That sounds quite application specific. Certainly you could set up
</I>&gt;<i> routing rules to put different classes of task into different queues,
</I>&gt;<i> but that may be too coarse grained for what you need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Maybe.

Basically most tasks only need to be done in a &quot;loose FIFO&quot; manner.   Some tasks will wind up sharing a particular attribute, and so their relative order must be followed.  The pool of possible values for this attribute is unlimited, but for any given task block, about 1/3 will share the attribute value with at least one other task.

Any ideas?

Thank you,
:<i>)
</I>
