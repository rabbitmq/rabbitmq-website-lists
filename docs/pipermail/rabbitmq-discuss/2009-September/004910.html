SASL stands for OTP's &quot;System Architecture and Support Libraries&quot;.

The rabbit-sasl.log contains log entries generated by Erlang/OTP, 
whereas the rabbit.log contains log entries generated by the rabbit app.

Queue process crashes should be very rare. If you do see them happening 
please report them.

Being able to recover persisted messages from crashed durable queues 
would indeed be desirable and is something we are looking into. Given 
that such crashes are considered severe and unsual events though, and 
the queue is basically in a completely unknown state at that point, I am 
reluctant to make such recovery automatic - some operator intervention 
is probably desirable.


Regards,

Matthias.
