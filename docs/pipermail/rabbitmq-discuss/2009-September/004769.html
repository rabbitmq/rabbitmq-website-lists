&gt;<i> 1) Is it hard to set up RabbitMQ for single machine use?

I wouldn't have thought so. There are packages for a variety of
penguins as well as windows. It's quite a straightforward process.

&gt;<i> 2) I see there are a few AMQP projects for python. &#160;What should I use?
</I>
A lot of people on this list seem to prefer Barry's library for it's
simplicity but YMMV. Some people prefer txAMQP because they're running
stuff in a reactor.

&gt;<i> Each task unit is less than 1kb and I don't intend for the queue to be allowed to grow than ~200 task units long. &#160;At that point, I have the task producer set to pause and wait until the queue goes down.
</I>
Without a back channel, how is the producer going to know about the queue depth?

&gt;<i> I do want to be able to flag certain tasks as &quot;dependant&quot;, so that a certain task must be marked &quot;done&quot; before it's dependent can can run.
</I>
That sounds quite application specific. Certainly you could set up
routing rules to put different classes of task into different queues,
but that may be too coarse grained for what you need.

HTH,

Ben
