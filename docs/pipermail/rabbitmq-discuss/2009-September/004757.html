<PRE>Hi Patrick,

No, I think you are creating fresh sockets (TCP connections) each time.
Both fresh instances of .NET's &quot;Socket&quot; class, and fresh TCP port number
allocations.

&gt;<i> &quot;Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network

</I>
Close enough, yes. The message is descriptive text associated with the
socket error code EADDRINUSE (WSAEADDRINUSE on Windows), which has a few
meanings, one of which relates to the inability of the system to
allocate a fresh transient port number.

&gt;<i> ... so even though I have already closed the socket explicitly the

That's right.

&gt;<i> Taking your suggestion to make IModel and IConnection module level, my
</I>&gt;<i> threaded PublishMessage method now looks like the following...
</I>
It looks much better. Avoiding needless connection reestablishment is
generally a good idea.

&gt;<i> so the error is fixed, but... I still cannot even come close to the 4000
</I>&gt;<i> messages per second capability (with better then twice the hardware)
</I>&gt;<i> described at:

</I>
You mentioned earlier that your messages are 400 kilobytes each. If you
have a 100 megabit ethernet, you will saturate your network link at
around 25 of these per second. If, as you mentioned earlier, you are
sending 4000 copies of a 400kB message, then with a 100 megabit
ethernet, you will be unlikely to see the task complete in less than
two-and-a-half minutes.

Regards,
  Tony
