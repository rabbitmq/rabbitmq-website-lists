<PRE>Hi Paul

Yes, this explains quite a few things. Using the native TCP would be anyway better than encapsulated in HTTP where you loose the ability to have Synchronous transmissions, etc.

Your suggestion with stunnel / abusing the https-'hole' would work with most proxies quite well, unless you got a proxy with 'deep inspection'. (normal proxy just 'bridge' the https session, deep inspection actually decrypts the session, validates content and re-package the traffic again. Means that the nice little use-putty-with-proxy-against-443-ssh does not work with such proxies.)

I'd rather had an open tcp port, but explaining this to the network/security guy's will result in a big fuzz and discussions and meetings and so on and since it's not business critical I'll never get through with this request (sorry, I'm damaged by big companies :))

What I want to check out after my holidays would be <A HREF="http://www.nocrew.org/software/httptunnel.html">http://www.nocrew.org/software/httptunnel.html</A> which promises (to me) exactly what I'm looking for...

Cheers
Josh

Betreff: Re: [rabbitmq-discuss] beginners question about RabbitMQ over HTTP

Josh,

At this stage, none of the standard clients actually support connecting to Rabbit via HTTP. The rabbitmq-mochiweb plugin simply provides an embedded HTTP server within the broker - it doesn't actually provide any HTTP services for the client to connect to.

The rabbitmq-jsonrpc plugin does actually provide a JSON-RPC endpoint for the broker - however, the only client provided for this is a Javascript based client (though this in no way means that a non-javascript client wouldn't be possible).

RabbitHub (<A HREF="http://github.com/tonyg/rabbithub/tree/master">http://github.com/tonyg/rabbithub/tree/master</A>) provides another HTTP-style endpoint for Rabbit - in this case, via a Restful API. Once again, however, there is no official client for this.

The documentation is being updated for the various rabbitmq-* plugins as part of the 1.7 release, so hopefully the distinction between the various functions will become clearer at that point.

On your original point however, is it actually not possible to get the RabbitMQ port opened through your firewall? Or alternatively, would you be able to use something like stunnel to sneak the traffic through looking like HTTPS? (this would certainly require experimentation, as I'm not entirely sure this would all work from a protocol perspective - I suspect it would all depend on the strength of the firewall/proxy)

Hopefully this helps clear up some of your questions.

Paul.

Hi all

My goal is to connect my consumers and providers over http to the RabbitMQ (fw/proxy between clients and queue), and after a few hours of googeling I'm more confused than before.

I was kind of able to get the rabbitmq-mochiweb running, but didn't find any examples how to use/verify it with amqplib/python

Can someone pinpoint me whether this is already possible, and how to start?

Cheers &amp; thanks
Josh
