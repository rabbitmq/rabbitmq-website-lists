I am not aware of any problem in that area that got fixed in those
releases. Have you got a reference?

&gt;<i> I don't have any errors in my rabbit log (other than errors about

</I>&gt;<i> I don't have an erlang crash dump anywhere.
</I>
In that case the only way for the queue to have disappeared is as part
of auto-deletion due to the 'exclusive' or 'auto-delete' flag being set,
or explicit deletion with 'queue.delete'. Unless you are running in a
cluster, in which case queues can disappear if the node they reside on
disappears.


Regards,

Matthias.
