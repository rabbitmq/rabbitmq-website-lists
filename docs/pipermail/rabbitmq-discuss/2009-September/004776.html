&gt;<i> &gt; The one-and-only producer, I had thought, would do something like sleep for a 
</I>&gt;<i> few seconds, query the queue size, and if it's getting low, generate a new block 
</I>&gt;<i> of tasks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How are you going to do this from the client?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Well...  i don't know.  :)

As i mentioned, I was planning to use python's multiprocessing.Queue, and that certainly does supply the ability to query the current queue size. 

I am trying to figure out if I can to this in RabbitMQ.  


&gt;<i> &gt; Is this not advisable in RabbitMQ based systems?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Provided you can answer the question above (which incidentally does
</I>&gt;<i> have a solution) then I don't see this being an issue per se. From an
</I>&gt;<i> architectural perspective you might say that it couples producers and
</I>&gt;<i> consumers, which is what a consumer driven message broker tries to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid in general. It could also be argued that it makes multicasting
</I>&gt;<i> more difficult since you would be bypassing the exchange concept. But
</I>&gt;<i> consumers can share queues as well, which might actually what you want
</I>&gt;<i> in your use case.  And, you could always architect in some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> command mechanism that abstracts out the queue control from the
</I>&gt;<i> producers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
As a AMPQ newbie I am not quite sure what you mean.

To clarify:  In the problem at hand, there is a very large list of tasks to complete stored in a proprietary system.   The proprietary system is constantly reshuffling / editing the list of tasks, and waits for an external &quot;execution engine&quot; to ask for some tasks to work on.  These are marked as &quot;in progress&quot;, and eventually &quot;done&quot;.  

However, &quot;execution engine&quot; should only be asking for &lt;300 tasks to be marked &quot;in progress&quot; at any time, so as to allow the main system to modify as many tasks as it needs to.

I was hoping to use AMQP in the &quot;execution engine&quot; to reliably distribute these tasks to ~20 workers.  After the task is done the &quot;execution engine&quot; needs to tell the main system to mark that task as done.

Perhaps AMPQ is the wrong tool for the job?




&gt;<i> &gt; Basically most tasks only need to be done in a &quot;loose FIFO&quot; manner.   Some 
</I>&gt;<i> tasks will wind up sharing a particular attribute, and so their relative order 
</I>&gt;<i> must be followed.  The pool of possible values for this attribute is unlimited, 
</I>&gt;<i> but for any given task block, about 1/3 will share the attribute value with at 
</I>&gt;<i> least one other task.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If your tasks were expressible as numeric priorities and Rabbit
</I>&gt;<i> actually implemented priorities, then that might be a option. But
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately it doesn't yet. If you can get away with a priority
</I>&gt;<i> queue, you could always put one into your consumer and then set a
</I>&gt;<i> larger prefetch window so that the PQ in your app has more than one
</I>&gt;<i> message to prioritize.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Not sure what you mean...  can you point me to the docs on this?

Worst case I will just dedicate ~5 single worker queues to just handle the pure &quot;in order&quot; streams separately.

(Assuming RabbitMQ can even be used here... see above.)
