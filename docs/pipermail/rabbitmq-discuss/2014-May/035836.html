<PRE>Yes, the s_client is able to connect to the rabbit server. It will take me some time to add the option to set ssl_options since I have no experience with Erlang and am also busy with some other tasks. We currently have a workaround by using an ssh tunnel to secure the connections between rabbit servers but it would be nice to use built in configuration instead. If someone else can test it out that would be great but otherwise I will see what I can do about testing it out with the depth option set on the client. This issue can actually be reproduced with a standard single intermediary cert by setting the depth setting to 0 in the ssl_options in rabbitmq.config.

Thanks,

Thomas

Can s_client connect to the rabbit server?

I hear you, but I want to make sure that is really the issue here. If you don't mind writing a little bit of Erlang, you could try connecting to the upstream with the Erlang client, which *does* permit arbitrary ssl_options? It would be informative to know whether that works.
