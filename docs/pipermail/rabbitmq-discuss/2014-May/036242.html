<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  What I mean when I say &quot;reliable&quot; is: All subscribers at the time of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> publish will eventually get the message.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That should be possible, assuming that all live inconsistent nodes will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eventually rejoin (without dumping messages). I know this is not the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case in rabbitmq, but it is definitely theoretically possible. I guess
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is what is usually referred to as eventual consistency.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  So why did you originally say:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It must be a cluster because we want clients to be able to connect to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each node transparently. Federation is not an option.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  ...because it really sounds like federation is what you want :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Services in our setup must be ignorant to which of the two data centers
they are connected to. Since queues are not mirrored, this is not possible
with a federation.


&gt;<i>  Do you know what the consequence of doubling it might be?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It will take twice as long to conclude that a remote node that is no
</I>&gt;<i> longer connected has actually gone away. Until then, things can block.
</I>

Thanks. Perfect.


&gt;<i>  About the CAP theorem in relation to rabbit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Reliable messaging (zero message loss), is often preferred in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SOA-settings. I wonder why vmware/pivotal/... chose not to prioritize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this guarantee. It is aimed by the federation setup, but it is a little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to weak in its synchronization. It would be preferred if it had a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possibility of communicating consumption of messages. Then one could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mirror queues between up/down-stream exchanges, and have even more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;availability&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you're talking about here.
</I>

Sorry for being unclear.


&gt;<i> Federation certainly should be able to ensure zero message loss! (Assuming
</I>&gt;<i> you leave it in &quot;on-confirm&quot; ack-mode).
</I>

Yes, assuming that there actually is a queue (with a binding) on the right
node.


&gt;<i> So when you say &quot;if it had a possibility of communicating consumption of
</I>&gt;<i> messages&quot; you're talking about a sort of eventually consistent federated
</I>&gt;<i> mirrored queue? I have wondered about producing such a thing. But as usual
</I>&gt;<i> the list of things we could do is large, and the resources small. And I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect the cost of producing it would be quite large, mostly due to the
</I>&gt;<i> need to somehow reunify the queues after a partition.
</I>

This is really exactly what is needed IMO. It sounds very much like this is
the setup TIBCO uses, when guaranteeing zero-message-loss.
I definitely appreciate that the reunification procedure is not simple.
However, mirrored queues are usually somewhat static (in that they are
created once and lives forever). Maybe a simple queue union, with some sort
of message consumption union as well, so node 1 can delete messages
consumed on node 2. I suppose it could be implemented efficiently by adding
a sequence number to the messages in each queue, and then having a list of
intervals of consumed message sequence numbers, or similar.

It would be a great (!) addition to rabbitmq, and I am very interested in
hearing of any progress.

Thank you big time,
-- S :-)
