Ah, right.

So why did you originally say:

&gt;<i> It must be a cluster because we want clients to be able to connect to

</I>
...because it really sounds like federation is what you want :-)

</I>&gt;<i> Thank you! (!)
</I>&gt;<i> I have been looking for that one. But I am surprised to see that it is

</I>&gt;<i> Do you know what the consequence of doubling it might be?
</I>
It will take twice as long to conclude that a remote node that is no 
longer connected has actually gone away. Until then, things can block.

Yes.

&gt;<i> Will a

Yes.

</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> About the CAP theorem in relation to rabbit.
</I>&gt;<i> Reliable messaging (zero message loss), is often preferred in

</I>&gt;<i> this guarantee. It is aimed by the federation setup, but it is a little

</I>&gt;<i> possibility of communicating consumption of messages. Then one could
</I>&gt;<i> mirror queues between up/down-stream exchanges, and have even more
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;availability&quot;.
</I>
I'm not sure what you're talking about here. Federation certainly should 
be able to ensure zero message loss! (Assuming you leave it in 
&quot;on-confirm&quot; ack-mode).

So when you say &quot;if it had a possibility of communicating consumption of 
messages&quot; you're talking about a sort of eventually consistent federated 
mirrored queue? I have wondered about producing such a thing. But as 
usual the list of things we could do is large, and the resources small. 
And I suspect the cost of producing it would be quite large, mostly due 
to the need to somehow reunify the queues after a partition.

Cheers, Simon
