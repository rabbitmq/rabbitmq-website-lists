This is true.

You can set the basic.qos to 1 before consuming; that way you only have 
to buffer one message.

If that doesn't appeal you could also have your clients agree on the 
name of a queue to use as a mutex; exclusively declaring that queue 
could be taken as proving that the exclusive consume operation will 
succeed, and you could perform the business logic between declaring and 
consuming.
