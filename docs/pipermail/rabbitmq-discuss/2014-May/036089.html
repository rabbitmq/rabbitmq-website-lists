<PRE>Michael,

Good to hear from you again. If you don't mind, I have a few questions
about your setup.

I assume for the AMQP proxy, you are referring to something like your
Fabrik. Would that be correct? How is open sourcing that going? I've been
interested since your original post.

Being short on resources, but working with developers who have resources, I
am inclined to introduce them to the idea of the middle layer and seeing
what we can come up with that is equitable for all.

I think being able to not persist messages in RabbitMQ would be a big win
for us. This removes the bulk of the io, and I solves our still occasional
partitioning problems. I'm going to talk to other service owners about
persisting messages themselves in databases and passing only the ids of
their messages around. I don't think we can implement a unified middle
layer given some time constraints, but I'm going to propose that as well
(as I think it is the best way to approach this). Lacking the ability to
implement, does shifting persistence to databases and maintaining a batch
table (of ids in flight) seem like a reasonable interim solution? Or is
there another approach?

A couple of our service owners already do this. Most do not and instead
pass entire documents via RabbitMQ to persistent queues. I have a hard time
identifying who some are but am working on that as well. I think providing
an API for them would make a huge difference in getting them to standardize
around a better use of RabbitMQ.

I was toying with a simpler implementation of your cluster configuration,
but (and I think we discussed this) it will require that producers and
consumers connect to separate proxy hosts, correct? I am still largely
unfamiliar with how federation and shovel work--despite having read the
documentation. I am working on a test bed for myself in my spare time (ha).
It would be nice to have this proxy layer be single unclustered rabbit
nodes. I could then take do no downtime upgrades of RabbitMQ, add capacity
for certain vhosts, etc. Am I understanding federation and shovel
correctly? Is this even possible?

The idea here being

publisher - proxy - backing cluster - proxy - consumer

Where consumers take messages from queues bound to exchanges to which
publishers are connected.

I think this requires a database for persistence, because if you publish to
a proxy exchange and no consumers are connected, then the message gets
lost.

Is there a reasonable way to avoid this without Fabrik? Publisher confirms
don't help if no queues are bound. And if we are sharing a database between
producer and consumer, why bother with RabbitMQ at all?

The beauty of message buses is the ability to pass arbitrary messages over
them. Without that, what are they for? I realize that we don't want to pass
large documents in them, but a small JSON blob seems perfectly reasonable.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to be a given that RabbitMQ was not designed for the batch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> processing use case (i.e. using RabbitMQ as a buffer between large serial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> steps). We have a system in place that attempts to do just that, however.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is not a 'given' as far as we are concerned. We have some processes
</I>&gt;<i> that result in a million or more messages being queued within a minute or
</I>&gt;<i> so. These messages are processed over the ensuing several minutes (for
</I>&gt;<i> 'dismissals' of news items from individual devices) to several hours (for
</I>&gt;<i> lower-priority individualized  'offers'). This is the new 'batch'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have been working with the developers of the software involved in an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attempt to help them redesign around a more ideal use of RabbitMQ (or to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> help them move to a different bus altogether -- database or something like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kafka) and some of them have been able to simply operate in smaller batch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sizes (thus keeping their queues relatively small).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We put large message bodies in S3 and pass them by reference. We never use
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ persistence and compensate for that with replication. For 'real'
</I>&gt;<i> persistence we use Cassandra. Most importantly, none of our internal users
</I>&gt;<i> know this, as we provide them with an abstracted interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, I cannot stem the tide of improper RabbitMQ use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We try to make it easier to use us than not. We work hard to be the most
</I>&gt;<i> reliable, fastest, most scalable, most flexible and cheapest component of
</I>&gt;<i> our customers technology mix.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When things go poorly, millions of messages end up in the queues.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We target zero length queues. If they grow unexpectedly we: 1) autoscale,
</I>&gt;<i> 2) shift load, 3) start new regions - usually all those. Then we diagnose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In 3.1.x we saw this regularly cause our clusters to partition.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have never had a partition in production because we always
</I>&gt;<i> overprovision RabbitMQ so it can maintain cluster communications. We
</I>&gt;<i> basically avoid disk IO due to the risk of IO wait interfering w the
</I>&gt;<i> cluster heartbeat.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In 3.1.x and 3.2.x when we would delete large queues (5+ million messages
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enqueued), this would cause the cluster to become unresponsive, run out of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory, and then crash.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When we have tested situations like this, we found it best to just wipe
</I>&gt;<i> out the cluster and restart. Before doing this, we shift the load to other
</I>&gt;<i> regions operating in parallel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> During the 3.1 -&gt; 3.2 upgrade, we had to completely rebuild our clusters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When 3.2 came up, it soon crashed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have not had that problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the most recent upgrade, we saw a 3.2.3 cluster in our dev environment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crash. I performed an opportunistic upgrade to 3.3.1, because hey...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downtime already, so let's see if 3.3.1 addresses some of the issues we've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been seeing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/grepory/384410ac90186ed0ce2a">https://gist.github.com/grepory/384410ac90186ed0ce2a</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After the upgrade, 3.3.1 would not startup at all. I removed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia on all of the nodes and brought RabbitMQ back up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are not yet in production w 3.3.1 but 3.2.4 is running solidly in stage
</I>&gt;<i> and we will upgrade stage to 3.3.1 this coming week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3.3.1 has been up and running alright so far, but we haven't done another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> end-to-end test in our development environment in a while. One of these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tests can lead to at least a million messages in the queue over a period of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time on average.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A million is not that many - depending on size of course. As I said - our
</I>&gt;<i> target is 0, but really the question is: what's your rate of change? I try
</I>&gt;<i> to have enough 'headroom' to easily handle the surges - volumes can vary 20
</I>&gt;<i> to 1 depending on the news of the moment etc. If a queue builds and stays
</I>&gt;<i> high we add resources until it goes down and then investigate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, I guess my question is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I know that I have people using RabbitMQ like this, and there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing I can do to change that fact... what do I do?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You need enough resource. And it is good to be able to autoscale.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A specific suggestion I would make for any internal service provider is to
</I>&gt;<i> use an amqp proxy. We locate proxy clusters that we control in our internal
</I>&gt;<i> customers' computing environments. They publish to and subscribe from these
</I>&gt;<i> proxies. We control the shoveling/federation of the proxies to/from our
</I>&gt;<i> core pipelines in regions, redirecting as needed. The proxies are an
</I>&gt;<i> additional buffer and also allow us to 'launder' incoming messages, e.g. by
</I>&gt;<i> forcing persistence off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We also track and account for every message using metadata, and can charge
</I>&gt;<i> back... We are cheap but not free.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I hope this helps.
