<PRE>Thanks Simon.

The messages are non-persistent but the queues are mirrored to exactly one
other node on a 4-node cluster. I was thinking if I created an exchange for
each routing key, rather than use one exchange and then route by routing
key, would that help? (I am not trying work around anything but I wanted to
know if I am overloading one Exchange when I could create multiple
exchanges. I understand that Exchanges are always HA'ed (even when not
specified) in a cluster. Does that mean that routing and acknowledging to
the messages happens out of just one node on a 4-node cluster? How about
Heartbeats? I am not saying this is a bottleneck but I am trying to
understand the functionality.)

One other key thing I missed to mention: (
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/v3.3.1/rabbitmq-dotnet-client-3.3.1-user-guide.pdf">http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/v3.3.1/rabbitmq-dotnet-client-3.3.1-user-guide.pdf</A>
)

*There are two styles of interaction available to ModelBase:*
*&#8226; synchronous, RPC-style interaction, e.g. ExchangeDeclare, BasicGet and
BasicConsume.*
*&#8226; asynchronous, event-style interaction, e.g. BasicAck, BasicPublish.*

Is it true that .NET client library considers BasicPublish and BasicAck as
Events (on a tcp connection), meaning it is not holding up any resources?

(BTW, I am not a developer but I Admin RabbitMQ clusters in production.)
The other take away is to allow publish multiple messages and let .NET
client library keep track of the delivery-tag counts from the server.

Thanks!
