You are running 3.3.x? The new semantics for consumer prefetch mean that 
setting basicQos after consuming will only define a prefetch for *new* 
consumers. You could work around this by setting global=true.

See <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-prefetch.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-prefetch.html</A> for more information.

I am starting to wonder if the global=false qos should set the prefetch 
for all consumers on the channel; you wouldn't be able to have one 
channel with multiple consumers with different prefetch, but this is an 
area that seems to be unintuitive...

Cheers, Simon
