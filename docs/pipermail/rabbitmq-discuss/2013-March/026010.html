<PRE>Hi,

What does 'stops responding' actually mean? Does the consumer cease processing messages (when there are still un-acked messages in the queue(s) it is consuming from) or is the problem something else. 

&gt;<i> I have heartbeat count =0 and in the management plugin view its showing that the connections are still live.
</I>
Just because the server still sees a connection, doesn't mean that the physical network link remains - operating systems can take 'quite some time' to notice unresponsive peers. Also, I didn't realise that the amqp-c client had support for heartbeats? Perhaps the maintainer can clear that up though, as it's quite possible it does but I've simply forgotten.

&gt;<i> Could you please help me  in rectifying the issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
We'll do our best to help. If you could clarify what specific (and unexpected) behaviour your seeing in the consumer, then we'll take it from there.

Cheers!
Tim
