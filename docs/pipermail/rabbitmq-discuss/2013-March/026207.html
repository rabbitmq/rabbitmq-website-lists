<PRE>I have set up an experimental repository at <A HREF="https://github.com/hyperthunk/rabbitmq-lager">https://github.com/hyperthunk/rabbitmq-lager</A> that supports logging to lager via its built in error_logger redirection. You enable via `rabbitmq-plugins enable lager` and configure it in the RabbitMQ config file just like any other plugin, under the key 'lager'. In the morning I'll chat with the guys about integrating this as experimental plugin for the time being, so people can play around and see if it offers the required functionality.

Cheers,
Tim

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The info/progress/error reports have a lot of data in them, process stats, stack traces, etc. are you wanting to see all that plonked on one single long line? Because I can see how that'd make parsing/aggregating easier, but not reading them. Does the lager output fit exactly with what you want (I've not looks at it or a couple of years)?
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that everything needs to fit on one line. Longer traces which provide good context should probably remain as multiline entries. However, info items, for example,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> need not get split up over two lines.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With regard to longer traces, it would be nice if they could be handled in such a way that the generic portion of the call stack were trimmed down to something nearer the actual call site, rather that the entire generic call trace. As inspiration, logback mitigates the default &quot;root cause comes last&quot; behavior in Java with the reverse depth layout modifier (rEx{depth}). Lot's of hand waving here though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I do have to concur with Gavin on people's perception about Rabbit due to logging - I've have many conversations with people over the years who ask why Rabbit has such bizare logging - I've generally answered that this is an Erlang-ism, and though it is strange, the server kind of serves its primary function well (i.e. delivering messages), so just put up with it.
