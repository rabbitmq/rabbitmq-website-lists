<PRE>We are currently running on Fedora 11 and have not been able to figure out how to reproduce the issue.  The actual problem that we're chasing down is that our hard disks are getting hammered but we can't find the root cause.  We're essentially wondering if the errors are cause or effect.

We're currently testing v3.0.3 but it has not been subject to the same operating conditions as systems running with 2.8.6 and 2.8.7 yet.  Also, we're seeing these errors in configurations without the use of the shovel as well.

There have been potentially relevant improvements to the shovel in
v3.0.1 and v3.0.2. Are you able to check whether the problem can be
reproduced with the latest version of the plugin?

&gt;<i> {{badmatch,{error,{{socket_error,enomem},{expecting,'connection.start'}}}},

What operating system produced this error? Can you easily reproduce it?
