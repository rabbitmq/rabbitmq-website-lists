Connection timeouts are mostly determined by the underlying TCP stack and operating system configuration. If you have sent a message and it is not arriving at the queue, can you see it arriving at the exchange it is being sent to? If it *does* arrive at the exchange, this is probably indicative of an error in your bindings (between the published-to exchange and the queue from which you wish to receive messages sent to that exchange). If it does *not* arrive at the exchange, then you should check that the network link is established and working at the time of sending. There are various ways to do this, but a simple mechanism to ensure messages arrive is to enable publisher confirms (see <A HREF="http://rabbitmq.com/confirms.html">http://rabbitmq.com/confirms.html</A> for details) which will ensure that the brokers sends an ACK for each message it has taken responsibility for - the reliability guide (<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/reliability.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/reliability.html</A>) has some more information about this too.

I have no idea if the amqp-c client has any support for publisher confirms. If it does not, then you can verify the state of the connection(s) using the management plugin and/or a tool such as wireshark. You can also use the firehose tracer (<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/firehose.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/firehose.html</A>) to trace message routing through your topology. 

Cheers,
Tim

</I>&gt;<i> What does 'stops responding' actually mean? Does the consumer cease processing messages (when there are still un-acked messages in the queue(s) it is consuming from) or is the problem something else.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just because the server still sees a connection, doesn't mean that the physical network link remains - operating systems can take 'quite some time' to notice unresponsive peers. Also, I didn't realise that the amqp-c client had support for heartbeats? Perhaps the maintainer can clear that up though, as it's quite possible it does but I've simply forgotten.
