<PRE>Hello RMQ List,
I have hopefully a quick and easy question.

We have a RabbitMQ instance on a Windows server, but the clients are running a mix of Windows/Ubuntu. We were looking to make a remote call to delete a VHOST, and then recreate the same VHOST.

For example, we have a VHOST named &quot;Test-Service&quot;. We want to delete &quot;Test-Service&quot; to wipe out all of its queues, and messages, and then start anew, recreating the &quot;Test-Service&quot; for automated testing purposes.

We currently are doing this on a local RabbitMQ instance via the rabbitmqctl  command line tool, but would like to use a centralized RabbitMQ server. The queues are being recreated programmatically already, but we're looking for a solution, something that can be hopefully used with Gradle, to recreate the VHOST before running our service.

Thank you for your time,
-Christopher Lefevre
