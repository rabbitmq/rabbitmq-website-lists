<PRE>Thanks for a thoughtful message. On a couple of points:

On 08/03/13 03:03, McIntosh Jason wrote:

</I>
There is an optimisation in RabbitMQ that should account for this - when 
a message first reaches a queue, it is sent to the persister to go to 
disc. If the persister is busy it will join an (internal, non-AMQP) 
queue there. It can be sent out to consumers *before* it has been 
persisted - and if the consumer is autoack, or the consumer acks the 
message before it has made it to disc, we may end up never persisting 
the message at all - it's no longer relevant. Needless to say, we will 
only issue a confirm once either the message is persisted or a consumer 
has acknowledged it.

&gt;<i> Now for the warnings: 1)  TURN OFF HIPE.  This was testing with
</I>&gt;<i> Erlang R15B03 - the latest release and RabbitMQ 3.0.2.  With HIPE and
</I>&gt;<i> the load we were putting on the system, Rabbit crashes bad, no
</I>&gt;<i> errors, no warning, it's just suddenly dead.  It seems to happen a
</I>&gt;<i> few minutes into the load.  I've not enabled any kind of debugging to
</I>&gt;<i> trace this down, but this was scary enough that we immediately turned
</I>&gt;<i> off HIPE everywhere.
</I>
That certainly is scary, and unlike our experiences - we've generally 
seen HiPE crash immediately or work fine. I suspect the platform is an 
issue here. But yes, you should be cautious turning on HiPE in production...

&gt;<i> 2)  These numbers are very preliminary and should be taken with a
</I>&gt;<i> grain of salt.  Still, it's pretty interesting to see what Rabbit can
</I>&gt;<i> handle under a load, and that it seems (at least from publishing) to
</I>&gt;<i> be much more IO bound than CPU bound.  I'd love to hit a smaller CPU
</I>&gt;<i> system that has more IO capacity to see if I can bottle neck on CPU
</I>&gt;<i> and see performance there.
</I>
Sure. Alternatively turn off persistence and you will become CPU-bound 
quite easily :-)

&gt;<i> 3)  Tests were done from a remote system to the server.  I used about
</I>&gt;<i> 30% of a 1GB connection - there IS a possibility there's some bottle
</I>&gt;<i> necking on the network due to frame sizes and other settings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4)  I've not tested a whole lot of variations on this test yet, as
</I>&gt;<i> I've not had the time, but it'd be interesting to test with different
</I>&gt;<i> settings (i.e. async:1, A:0 settings, changing to XFS file system
</I>&gt;<i> from EXT4, etc.).  This is currently a very default install of
</I>&gt;<i> Rabbit.
</I>
At a guess, the biggest change is likely to be using an SSD.

Cheers, Simon
