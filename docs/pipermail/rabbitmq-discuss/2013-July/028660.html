<PRE>Hmmm - I use pika a lot and have occasion to use channel.basic_nack. It
takes about 5 ms before the message is picked up by another consumer in my
case.

If you are using BlockingConnection, I would suggest testing instead with
one of the asynch adapters, e.g. SelectConnection. Or use TornadoConnection
if you need more speed/responsiveness, or LibevConnection (which I wrote
and is in a pull request at the pika project github) if you are adventurous
and want &quot;the one that rules them all&quot; (for python anyway).

There's really no good reason for the delays you are experiencing.

AFIK, however, the rejected/nacked messages is queued as if it were new,
but with the redeliver flag set, AND any consumer may receive them,
including the one which rejected/nacked them. Of course if you have
multiple consumers on a queue, the rabbit will round-robin.

But, the rejected/nacked message does not go to the 'front' of the queue as
you desired (again AFAIK).

At the platitude level, I would suggest that you 'think async' - because
the real world, and rabbitmq, work that way. Avoid anything with 'blocking'
in it.
