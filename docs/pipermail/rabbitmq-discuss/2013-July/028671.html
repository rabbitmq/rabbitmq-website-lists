<PRE>Hello,
I am new to rabbitmq. I am trying to clarify some basic use cases for
rabbitmq, and could use to some help.

First of all, if this is the wrong forum for this question, I apologize and
all I ask is that I might get some helpful advice on another source to have
my question answered. Otherwise, here is my question:

I have read a good deal of rabbitmq documentation, and have a pretty clear
understanding of how it could support some of the use cases I am
investigating, but not all of them.

I have use cases where an external user (i.e., someone who would be
interfacing with my system from web services via the internet) would need to
send messages to me. These messages would either be to initiate a
data-sending event (i.e., they are a data provider to me), or a
data-receiving event (i.e., they would be receiving data from me, however
they are initiating the request rather than monitoring a rabbitmq queue that
I creating for a data-sending event I initiated).

Are there reasonable ways to support these use cases with rabbitmq, or
should I be looking elsewhere?

Thank you for any response!
