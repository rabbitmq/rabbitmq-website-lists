<PRE>Matthias,

One last attempt at reproducing your results. I found a newer server, Dell R610, and ran the same test and got the same results as you see. So my poor performance can at least partially be accounted for with the old machine I was using. Also, I think we will re-think the use of a VM for hosting brokers since that also made a significant difference. The VM I tested on was running on a Dell R710 so should be somewhat better than the R610.

So I assume that we can only expect to achieve about the 50kHz number with no consumers, or bindings then.
