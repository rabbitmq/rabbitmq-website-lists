It's helpful to know that this might be a known deadlock I'm dealing with.

&gt;&gt;<i> I have scripts to automate updating the federated exchanges, to effect

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'm restarting the server immediately after, on each federated node, in
parallel with Ansible.

I have more information from recent trial-and-error attempts at a
workaround. The shutdown hang happens fairly consistently under the
following conditions:

1. Federated connection URIs are <A HREF="amqps://.">amqps://.</A> If I use unsecured amqp:// no
shutdown hang.
2. Number of servers &gt; 2
3. In EC2, especially across different geographic regions. If I set up a
three-server demo among local KVM-virtual machines, I haven't seen a
shutdown hang.

I suspect something about the other servers' upstream exchange
connection attempts, *during* the restart of a server, might have
something to do with it.

Is there a workaround I might try to avoid the deadlock? For example,
maybe a rabbitmqctl command to close &amp; prevent new federated connections
while all the servers are reconfiguring? I don't necessarily think its a
federation issue, maybe just the concurrent client connections getting
to the wrong place at the wrong time?

Thanks!
