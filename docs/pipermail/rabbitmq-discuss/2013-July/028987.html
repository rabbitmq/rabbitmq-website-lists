</I>&gt;<i>   * For the failure path, asserts that the sent message is available

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Granted, the latter does assume that you can shut down the adapter

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Apologies if i'm being thick, but what do you mean by &quot;adapter&quot;? Do you 
mean code that sits between the application code and the AMQP library? 
Or code that the test can use to take a grip on the application code? Or 
something else?
