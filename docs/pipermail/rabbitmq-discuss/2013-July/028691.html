<PRE>Hello All,

I've been trying to setup a cluster using -setcookie flag to make sure the
cookie is same for all nodes. Only issue it, it doesn't seem to work.
Whatever I do, erlang creates a new .erlang.cookie file with a different
value in the user's home directory.

Additionally what is the user home if RabbitMQ runs as a windows service as
&quot;Local System&quot; user?

Appreciate any help in this regards.
