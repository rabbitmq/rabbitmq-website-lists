In the future we hope to have shovels that can be dynamically 
reconfigured at run time; I don't consider permanency to be an inherent 
feature of shovels. And being able to spin up a quick shovel to move 
messages from one queue to another within the same broker is a use case 
for that.

However, &quot;permanent&quot; shovels are all we've got at the moment. But bear 
in mind the shovel doesn't need to be in the same broker as the queues - 
you could spin up an ad hoc broker node on the same machine with 
whatever shovels you need, then shut it down when you're done.

Cheer, Simon
