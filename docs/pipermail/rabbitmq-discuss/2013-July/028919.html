<PRE>Michael thanks for the reply.

Our logstash consumers do use their own connection , we do not use the
same connection for publishing (logstash rabbitmq output) and for
consuming (logstash rabbitmq input) , I was under the impression that
the consumers are blocked due to the fact that when rabbitmq starts to
block producers due to flow rates looking at the logstash consumers
logs I see errors connecting to the broker (connection reset by host)
which implies that the broker rejects the consumers connection this of
course leads us to shaky state where messages are no delivered and the
only workaround we found is capturing the blocked producers list from
rabbitmq_ctl and restarting the logstash agents by looping on all the
blocked producers.
