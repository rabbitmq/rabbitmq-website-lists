Awesome!

&gt;<i> However, &quot;permanent&quot; shovels are all we've got at the moment. But bear

I don't know offhand how to start a brand new broker node. Is this 
something that will be obvious if i read the documentation, or is there 
any trick to it? Will there be any surprises if we do this on the same 
machine as a running node?
