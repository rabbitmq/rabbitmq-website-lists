You do realise that most client libraries will do that for you, right?

Correct.

&gt;<i> Question is, if RabbitMQ starts blocking publishing connections during

</I>
No. Heartbeats are not publishes. A publishing connection is one over 
which content-bearing AMQP methods are received, of which there is just 
one defined in the spec, namely basic.publish.
