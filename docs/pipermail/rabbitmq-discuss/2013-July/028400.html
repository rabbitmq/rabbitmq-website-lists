That, plus connection count.  
&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> ... in time&quot; it sounds like rates, but rates are more a proxy for CPU

</I>
Total, we haven't seen CPU problems, only suffered sudden memory exhaustion. 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - at what granularity would the limits (the &quot;too many&quot; part) be set? 
</I>&gt;<i> globally? per vhost? per user? per connection?
</I>
Per vhost and global. 

We do limit per vhost today, but it's the sudden bursts of queue declarations or channels openings that we can't protect us from today. 

A global limit would be sufficient for the time being, just for protection, so that the cluster doesn't dies before we can see who has done what. 
&gt;<i> Note that the finer grained the limits the lower the limits need to be 
</I>&gt;<i> if you want to have a high chance of preventing undesirable behaviour 
</I>&gt;<i> globally, e.g. for per user limits you'd have to assume that every user 
</I>&gt;<i> connecting to a single rabbit will hit the limit along each of the 
</I>&gt;<i> dimensions - channels, consumers, exchanges, queues, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I guess a combination would be ideal, so that you can limit both per cluster/server and per vhost.. But that's not necessary for us today, as the mgmt http api allow us to do that, for slow growth in queues/channels/consumers.
