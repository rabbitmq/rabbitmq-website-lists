<PRE>Emile, thanks for answers.

I hope that if I use transactions - I wouldn't lost my message.
In my case I send message and doesn't have any error =&gt; so I think that
message was successfully
processed by RabbitMQ but in true - my message is dropped.

Do you know any method how to be sure what message was send to any queue?
