<PRE>our rabbitmq (3.0.1) servers blocks producers (logstash) due to flow 
control triggering (reason is flow on rabbitctl) this however also blocked 
our consumers , to mitigate it we are restarting the blocked producers and 
consumers then the queue start to get balanced.

Reading the flow control docs , how can we avoid from blocking the 
consumers connections ? can they operate on a different channel ? we also 
lowered the message TTL and that seemed to slow down the waiting messages, 
we do understand that we have a bottleneck somewhere along the pipe that 
said could we configure out consumers to avoid flow control blocking ?
