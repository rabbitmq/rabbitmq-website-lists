If a basic.return is received before tx.commit-ok then the message was
not routed to any queues. If no basic.return was received before
tx.commit-ok then the message was routed to at least one queue.

The framing layer certainly appears to support AMQP_BASIC_RETURN_METHOD.

See <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/semantics.html:">http://www.rabbitmq.com/semantics.html:</A>
&quot;You will always receive any basic.returns before the tx.commit-ok.&quot;
