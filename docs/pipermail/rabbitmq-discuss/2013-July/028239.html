</I>If you need to store an unbounded number of messages in the queue, then
as i see it, you've got two options:

 1. Use the rabbitmq-toke plugin, which allows messages to be stored in
    tokyo cabinet. That said, I don't know how well supported and/or
    documented that is.
 2. Use another queue server, such as bitly's nsq, beanstalkd, or even
    Kafka.

Assuming that you've got very basic requirements in terms of your
messaging protocols (ie: one message to one consumer), then option 2)
might well work out better for you, to be honest. Rabbit makes a lot of
trade-offs that focus on flexible messaging topologies and reliable
delivery, all of which can work against raw throughput, and especially
the ability to act as an infinite buffer.
