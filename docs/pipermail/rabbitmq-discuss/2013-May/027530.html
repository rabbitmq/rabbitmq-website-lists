Have you checked the broker logfile? If the logfile contains entries
about abrupt disconnections then the problem is probably caused by a
network infrastructure issue. Do you see the same problem when you
connect to a broker over the loopback interface?

The connection Dispose() method is similar to calling Abort(), which is
similar to calling Close(), which throws an exception if the connection
is already closed. An alternative is to register a ConnectionShutdown
event handler.
