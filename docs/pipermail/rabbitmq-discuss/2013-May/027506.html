<PRE>I have a producer setup using the .Net client (v 3.1.0.0) that is accessing a
high volume stream and writing to a rabbitmq queue. Very frequently the
producer will freeze while trying to send a message and then get the
following exception:



Unable to write data to the transport connection: An existing connection was
forcibly closed by the remote host


I then try and dispose of the producer but then get another error message:


   gproducer.Dispose()

AlreadyClosedException

The AMQP operation was interrupted: AMQP close-reason, initiated by Library,
code=0, text=&quot;End of stream&quot;, classId=0, methodId=0,
cause=System.IO.IOException: Unable to write data to the transport
connection: An established connection was aborted by the software in your
host machine. ---&gt; System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: An established
connection was aborted by the software in your host machine
   at System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Send(Byte[] buffer, Int32 offset, Int32
size, SocketFlags socketFlags)
   at System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream.Write(Byte[] buffer, Int32 offset,
Int32 size)
   --- End of inner exception stack trace ---
   at System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream.Write(Byte[] buffer, Int32 offset,
Int32 size)
   at System.IO.BufferedStream.Flush()
   at System.IO.BinaryWriter.Flush()
   at RabbitMQ.Client.Impl.SocketFrameHandler_0_9.WriteFrame(Frame frame)
   at RabbitMQ.Client.Impl.ConnectionBase.WriteFrame(Frame f)
   at RabbitMQ.Client.Impl.ConnectionBase.HeartbeatWriteLoop()


To work around this I then create a new producer and a new connection and
the cycle continues. This has happened almost every minute. Is this a
problem with the .NET client because the other developers here say they have
no problem with their java versions.
