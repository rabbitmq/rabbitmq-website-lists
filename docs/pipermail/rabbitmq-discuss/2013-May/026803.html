<PRE>Hi Tim,
Thank you for your help and clarification.  I will probably have more questions as I am just getting started with RabbitMQ.

 Hi,

 &gt; I'm new to rabbitMQ.
 &gt; Having trouble getting connection to my RabbitMQ node:
 &gt; I start fresh (ps shows nothing running)
 &gt; I had no .erlang.cookie prior to starting because I deleted it.
 &gt;

 Erm, you need a cookie in order to do just about anything.

 &gt; I start the server (as rabbitmq user)
 &gt; -bash-4.1$ rabbitmqctl status
 &gt; Status of node <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at node1</A> ...
 &gt; Error: unable to connect to node <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at node1</A>: nodedown
 &gt;

 If you've got no cookie, then rabbitmqctl won't be able to connect to your
broker...

 &gt; DIAGNOSTICS
 &gt;
 &gt; I've tried looking at the docs and this one puzzles me.
 &gt; 1) I could see why <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at node1</A> isn't able to connect because I just
started it.  Is that what the error pertains to?

 Yes. It's not <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at node1</A> connecting to itself. It's
`<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbitmqctl2469 at node1</A>` trying to connect to <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at node1.</A>

 &gt; 2) Why does it think my nodename is <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbitmqctl2469 at node1</A>?
 &gt;   Why isn't it <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at node1</A> ?

 That's the node name of the rabbitmqctl process, not the broker process.
They need to be able to 'talk to one another', which requires them to share
the same erlang cookie.

 &gt; On top of all the problems trying to connect with <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at node1</A>, it
appears the node name is now different
 &gt;
 &gt; before it was:
 &gt; node name: <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbitmqctl24649 at node1</A>
 &gt; now its
 &gt; node name: <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbitmqctl24868 at node1</A>
 &gt;
 &gt; Would someone explain what is going on?

 That's completely normal. As I mentioned previously, the rabbitmqctl node
is different to the broker node. Each time you launch rabbitmqctl, it'll
choose a different node name, so that if you're trying to run multiple
rabbitmqctl commands simultaneously, the node names don't clash.

 HTH!

 Cheers,
 Tim
