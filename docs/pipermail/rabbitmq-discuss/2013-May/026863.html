It's described briefly in the &quot;Getting Started&quot; section of <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/shovel.html.">http://www.rabbitmq.com/shovel.html.</A>

&gt;<i> Some of my configurations rely on shovels being set up differently for

</I>&gt;<i> it is configured.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'd suggest taking a look at what it does now then. If the same (named) shovel is defined on two nodes that are clustered, it will run on only one of them.

&gt;<i> The reason for these configurations (backup strategy to compensate for
</I>&gt;<i> partitioning) may have become moot now&#352;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Perhaps - please let us know if that's not the case. 

&gt;<i> However, I have gotten pretty used to the shovel just being a
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward, well-behaved application on a single node, driven by that
</I>&gt;<i> node's configuration. If it now jumps around among nodes in the cluster
</I>&gt;<i> automatically then it is no longer straightforward - let's hope it is
</I>&gt;<i> still well-behaved!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Indeed. Sadly, it looks like we have broken the default reconnect_delay setting that was previously available. I've filed a bug to fix that. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.

Cheers,
Tim
