I'm afraid there isn't one at the moment. The FlowListener interface 
allows the client to determine if the server has sent channel.flow{}. 
But we haven't had the server do that for many releases now 
(channel.flow doesn't work very well).

We are looking at how we can expose the memory / disc alarm state to the 
client in a future release; hopefully it might be in 3.2.

&gt;<i> 2. Channel.close() method does not take a timeout value and the thread

</I>
Everything gets blocked *once the connection has published something*.

Connection.close() can take a timeout since there's something the client 
can do unilaterally when the timeout occurs (close the socket). But the 
client can't really do anything in an AMQP sense (including closing a 
channel) if the server is not cooperating.

Cheers, Simon
