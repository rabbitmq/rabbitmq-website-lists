<PRE>Hi. The behaviour you describe doesn't really match what I would expect 
to see. In the beginning of a partition I would expect:

1) Partition starts

2) Things behave slowly for approximately net_ticktime (see 
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#net_ticktime">http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#net_ticktime</A>) as nodes attempt 
to contact each other and time out

3) On each node, Erlang decides the other nodes are down. Things speed 
up again, HA queues fail over. Split-brain has begun.

It sounds like you were stuck in 2) for an extended period of time. Have 
you changed net_ticktime?

Alternatively, when testing partitions I have see really odd behaviour 
by blocking network traffic in one direction only with iptables. You 
might want to check if you've done that by mistake.

Cheers, Simon

</I>&gt;<i> event.  Essentially, I repeated the previous tests described below
</I>&gt;<i> for autohealing and automatic queue synchronization, but left the
</I>&gt;<i> cluster communications port blocked while the client test completed.
</I>&gt;<i> One oddity I noticed was that while the consumer connected to the
</I>&gt;<i> slave appeared to receive an indication that something was amiss
</I>&gt;<i> (client log showed a consumer cancel exception being handled by the
</I>&gt;<i> Spring AMQP framework, and other monitoring logs appeared to show the
</I>&gt;<i> client restarting a connection, which seems to be consistent with
</I>&gt;<i> documentation), the consumer connected to the master seemed to remain
</I>&gt;<i> oblivious to any possible issues.  That consumer continued to receive
</I>&gt;<i> messages, but at an extremely slow rate (test published at 16/sec
</I>&gt;<i> fixed rate, but the remaining consumer began to receive messages at
</I>&gt;<i> the rate of about 1 every 14 seconds).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since the test client waits around for expected message deliveries
</I>&gt;<i> with a resettable 30 second timeout, it continued to run for an
</I>&gt;<i> extended period of time (longer than I waited around for).  In
</I>&gt;<i> addition, the admin console showed a relatively small number of
</I>&gt;<i> unacked messages on that server, with the unacked count increasing
</I>&gt;<i> with each actual delivery (client should always be acknowledging in
</I>&gt;<i> the test setup, and reported no errors).  Eventually unblocking the
</I>&gt;<i> cluster port released a bunch of messages in a short interval (albeit
</I>&gt;<i> with some lost, as described previously).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also saw  producer connections go into flow control during the
</I>&gt;<i> outage and remain there during the slow consumer delivery (though the
</I>&gt;<i> test had long since completed delivering all its messages).

</I>&gt;<i> Does this sound like expected behavior during a partition?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To simulate a network partition failure, I've been using iptables
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to temporarily block inbound and outbound access on one of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nodes to the single port configured for cluster communications
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through inet_dist_listen_min and inet_dist_listen_max settings (min
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> = max). Client access is not blocked during a simulated partition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fault.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds reasonable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've observed two anomalies during testing that I wasn't expecting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on the documentation I've read:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -At a sufficiently high message rate, some number of messages will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be lost during the fault sequence, with the number lost tending to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> increase with message rate.  No indication of a send error has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been observed by the client program. Based on results obtained from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> test logs and an independent monitor listening on trace messages
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from each node, it appears that as soon as the port is blocked,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both nodes continue to accept published messages, but (temporarily)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stop delivering messages until the cluster heartbeat failure is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> detected, at which point the cluster is partitioned and the slave
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> promotes itself to become master. In the sequences I've looked at,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the messages that are lost all appear to be published to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> original master (and final master after a winner is selected during
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> autoheal).  Neither the start nor the end of the lost message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> window appear to line up with any events in the logs, other than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the start occurring sometime after the port connection is blocked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but before the cluster heartbeat failure is detected, and the end
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> occurring sometime after the detection of the cluster heartbeat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> failure and before the detection of the partitioned cluster after
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the connection is unblocked.  Is message loss to be expected in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this scenario?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would expect to see message loss in a cluster heal scenario.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's important to remember that a cluster partition is still a
</I>&gt;<i> substantial problem, and the healing process involves throwing state
</I>&gt;<i> away. Autoheal mode just means you get through this process faster,
</I>&gt;<i> and hopefully spend much less time accepting messages that will end
</I>&gt;<i> up being lost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would expect intuitively that only messages from the losing
</I>&gt;<i> partitions would be lost. But I am not entirely surprised if messages
</I>&gt;<i> from the winner are lost too; there is a period after the partitions
</I>&gt;<i> have come back together but before autoheal kicks in during which we
</I>&gt;<i> will have multiple masters for a queue, and behaviour can be
</I>&gt;<i> unpredictable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -Occasionally the autoheal loser node fails to rejoin the cluster
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> after restart.  I don't have a lot of data points on this one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since it's only happened a handful of times during overnight test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> iterations.  During one failure, the autoheal winner showed the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> log message below during recovery:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, that looks like a bug in autoheal. I think the stack trace you
</I>&gt;<i> posted should contain enough information to fix it. Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
