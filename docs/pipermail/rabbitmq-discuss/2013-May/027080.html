<PRE>Thanks Simon for prompt response and for the link. I verified the configuration according to my requirements, but messages are not being backed-up in upstream queue. Properties like expires and message_ttl are set to default. I couldn't figure out any plausible reason for this. Could it be related to exchange/queue publishing properties on upstream broker?

Thanks,
Punit

That's not expected behaviour (unless you set the connection's 'expires' 
and/or 'message_ttl' properties, in which case you get the behaviour you asked for).

Look at the upstream broker in mgmt / rabbitmqctl. It should contain queues with names like &quot;federation: (exchange) -&gt; (downstream)&quot;. 
Messages should back up in these queues while links are down. Do they?

&gt;<i> I tried to find some documentation on federation plugin configuration

Technically this is the documentation for 2.8.7, but that's only some bug fixes away from 2.8.2.

Cheers, Simon
