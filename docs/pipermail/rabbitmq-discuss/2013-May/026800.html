Well that definitely sounds wrong.

(Bear in mind that the channel is not damaged by this, you don't have to 
close it if you don't want to. But I can see you might want to.)

&gt;<i> Am I doing something wrong?  Is this a server bug?  Both?  :)
</I>
I doubt it's a server bug; we have an automated test which closes a 
channel after receiving a cancel notification. But Steve points out the 
way in which the Java client could trip you up. In previous mails I 
think you mentioned using the Perl client; possibly it has a similar 
limitation in callbacks?

If not, please post some example code and I will look into it.

Cheers, Simon
