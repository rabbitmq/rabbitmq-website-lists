That's perfectly normal, for a network driven application. It is not RabbitMQ's client library that wait's to throw an exception, but rather it is the operating system's network stack that takes time to determine that a peer socket is no longer available. This can take many minutes, even when you're connecting via the loopback interface (i.e., localhost) for testing.

On most unices, the relevant bits of `man tcp` are:

    &quot;When  a  network  error  occurs, TCP tries to resend the packet.  If it
     doesn't succeed after some time, either ETIMEDOUT or the last received
     error on this connection is reported.&quot;

In that second sentence, &quot;after some time&quot; is determined by the OS kernel configured limits, viz tcp_retries1 (defaults to 3 on linux) and tcp_retries2, and the configured retransmission timeout. Of course there are doubtless other parameters that interact with this behaviour. So you're quite lucky because it's a producer application that's trying to send - those time out much faster. For network consumer applications, this problem is quite a tricky on because the default settings on linux for example, mean delays of between 10 and 30 minutes before the OS networking layer &quot;notices&quot; the connection has timed out.

This problem is, of course, not specific to RabbitMQ.

Cheers,
Tim
