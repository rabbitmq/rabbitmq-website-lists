If I understand correctly you have a broker with disk free space close
to the disk free limit or memory use close to the high watermark, and
you want to disable resource flow control.

You should be aware that disabling resource flow control will make the
broker more likely to run out of resources and crash. A better solution
is to provision the broker with more resources. You should only relax
the resource limits if your application can tolerate the increased risk
of a crashing broker.

You can relax memory flow control by increasing the memory high
watermark from 40% to 50% or higher, e.g.

 rabbitmqctl set_vm_memory_high_watermark 0.5

Setting it to an infeasibly large ration effectively disables memory
flow control:

 rabbitmqctl set_vm_memory_high_watermark 100.0

These instructions will change the limits for a running broker. See the
instructions here for how to make the changes permanent by changing the
configuration file: <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#memsup">http://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#memsup</A>


You can reduce the disk free limit by specifying a lower limit:

 rabbitmqctl eval 'rabbit_disk_monitor:set_disk_free_limit(500000000).'

or disable it by setting the limit to zero:

 rabbitmqctl eval 'rabbit_disk_monitor:set_disk_free_limit(0).'

See <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#diskfreesup">http://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#diskfreesup</A> for persisting the
change in the configuration file.


&gt;<i> 2. I have read document about how to set up rabbitmq cluster
</I>&gt;<i> by&quot;<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html&quot;">http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html&quot;</A> But who is master and who is

</I>&gt;<i> cluster? I didn't see any mirror queue in this address, Can this cluster
</I>&gt;<i> still be HA cluster?
</I>
There is no global master. Queues can have different policies, so there
is a master node per queue (assuming the queue is mirrored). See the
&quot;rabbitmqctl list_queues&quot; documentation for querying the master and
slave nodes for queues:

<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html</A>

&gt;<i> 3. Is every message has length and size limit? what is the maximum size
</I>&gt;<i> of every message?
</I>

Messages can be as large as you like, but they should not consume a
significant fraction of total available RAM. If you want to process
extremely large messages then you need alot of RAM.

Queue length can be limited with the x-max-length argument. See
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/maxlength.html.">http://www.rabbitmq.com/maxlength.html.</A>
