<PRE>I'm not sure how you would normally deal with a source RPM in this respect, but anyway the src RPM that you've downloaded only contains the sources and these are given a release number by the build system. Take a look in the various shell scripts and makes files in the rabbitmq-public-umbrella for details.

Is there are a reason why you need to package from source yourselves?

Don't know - our rpm generation works fine, so maybe try to crib some ideas from there?

&gt;<i> 2) Are these incorrectly versioned filenames harmful?
</I>
Probably not. RabbitMQ brokers will refuse to cluster if their major versions differ, however for plugins there may be no adverse affects at all, but don't take that as gospel. Also it could be confusing for folks trying to offer on-list support if your rabbitmqctl output shows plugin version numbers of 0.0.0.

Cheers,
Tim
