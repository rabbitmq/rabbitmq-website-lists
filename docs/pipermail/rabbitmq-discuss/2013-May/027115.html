I didn't try that, but it wouldn't make any difference if that alarm was still set, since the producer would get blocked immediately would it not?

I've certainly been unable to replicate this across two machines, and with just localhost on Snow Leopard, I never get the queue to be anything but empty, that is once the producer is blocked and the consumer is receiving no more messages, running `rabbitmqctl list_queues' shows a queue length of 0. How do you get more messages into the queue then, if a memory alarm is still set? I didn't think that was possible?

Cheers,
Tim
