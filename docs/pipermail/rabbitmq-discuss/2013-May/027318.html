Hi,

My conclusion was similar about cost of making new connection over and 
over again. However, PHP works so that I can not reuse resources between 
two runs :(

Some extensions, like MySQL, has support for persistent connections in 
itself. I didn't notice AMQP extension has anything like that :( Will 
look into it more.

The same goes for AMQP heartbeats, which I didn't notice in 
documentation :( Hopefully there is &quot;hidden&quot; option for turning it on. 
It's probably something client requests?

Thanks!
Nikola

</I>&gt;<i> That is what AMQP heartbeats are for, when you're using a persistent connection. Presumably there is some way to maintain a connection (or pool of connections) in your PHP application and reuse them, rather than creating a new connections each time you want to send or receive messages. It is channels that are lightweight and can be created and thrown away cheaply, for short winded interactions like yours. Connections however, cost more to set up and tear down. I'm surprised this isn't familiar territory, since the same principles (i.e., the need to pool/cache connections) is common to all remote services, including more obvious ones like relational databases.
