I think you're getting confused between confirms and ACKs. Confirms sent from the broker to a producer are orthogonal to ACKs sent from a consumer to the broker. When the broker has accepted responsibility for a message, it will send a confirm _in the form of an ACK_ to the publisher. Now &quot;accepted responsibility&quot; means various things depending on you configuration - see <A HREF="https://www.rabbitmq.com/reliability.html">https://www.rabbitmq.com/reliability.html</A> for details - but in general, if the broker is able to immediately deliver a message to an active consumer, then it has certainly discharged it's responsibility &quot;to the producer&quot; for handling that message, therefore it sends a confirm (i.e., an ACK) to the producer. This is completely independent of what the consumer does with the message - it might NACK/REJECT it but that's &quot;the broker's problem to handle&quot; and not the producer's. Once the broker sends a confirm, *it* is responsible for the message.

What you appear to be looking for is a kind of RPC (in terms of synchronicity) between producer and consumer, and /that/ is not what messaging systems typically deliver, opting instead for a de-coupled view of the interaction via an intermediary (i.e., the broker). Notably, even JMS transactions do *not* coordinate over both the producer and consumer, but handle only one perspective or the other.

Cheers,
Tim
