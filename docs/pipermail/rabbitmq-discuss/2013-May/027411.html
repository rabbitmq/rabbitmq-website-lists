Just to check - how much faster is your unmirrored throughput?

But those performance figures sound wrong, I can go much faster than 
that on a less powerful machine.

How large are messages? Are you using acks / confirms?

Our Java client ships with a performance measuring tool. It would be 
good to test with that so that we are running the same tests. Can you 
grab the Java client tarball, unpack it and run:

$ ./runjava.sh com.rabbitmq.examples.MulticastMain -a -h 
<A HREF="amqp://&lt;server-name">amqp://&lt;server-name</A>&gt;

and tell us what message rates you get? That command line should use 
tiny unpersistent / unacked / unconfimed messages, so it should give us 
a baseline to work with.

If not all queues are configured to be mirrored you might need to add 
&quot;-u &lt;name of a queue to create that will be mirrored&gt;&quot;.

&gt;<i> Is there any Erlang/OTP tuning we can do? delegate_count is the default
</I>&gt;<i> 16, could someone explain what this does in a bit more detail please?
</I>
delegate_count is not itself used by mirroring; it (approximately) 
provides an upper bound on the parallelism available for cross-cluster 
channel -&gt; queue message routing. It's pretty rare to want to change it.

Cheers, Simon
