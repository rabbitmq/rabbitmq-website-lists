Is the O/S paging perhaps? If this is your regular &quot;desktop&quot; machine, 
plus you are running rabbit and the clients on it, then I'd image by the 
time rabbit hits the regular 40% watermark the O/S may well have started 
paging quite heavily. And at that point *everything* gets a lot slower, 
and large processes, like rabbit at that time, will suffer particularly 
badly.

The 40% is a reasonable default for machines that don't run much besides 
rabbit and/or on which rabbit isn't put under heavy load. If those 
conditions aren't met then lowering the threshold is advisable.

Matthias.
