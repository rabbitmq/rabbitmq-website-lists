Thanks.

Thanks for the prompt response :

I have the following scenario that led to my question

On 3.0.1 if I (via Java, not management console)

Have the rabbitmq_tracing plugin enabled Declare a queue &quot;tracepublish&quot;
Bind it to exchange amq.rabbitmq.trace with routing key publish.# Start a Consumer on &quot;tracepublish&quot;
Execute rabbitmqctl trace_on

I receive all the messages published perfectly.

However if I
Disable the rabbitmq_tracing plugin.
Declare a queue &quot;tracepublish&quot;
Bind it to exchange amq.rabbitmq.trace with routing key publish.# Start a Consumer on &quot;tracepublish&quot;
Execute rabbitmqctl trace_on

I get no messages on the consumer side. Almost as though the firehose tracing was disabled when the plugin was disabled

Thanks

Jeff

We are not planning any major work on it in the foreseeable future.
We haven't received many bug reports or feature requests since releasing it. Which could mean either the plug-in works perfectly, or it doesn't get used much, or both :) Take your pick.

&gt;<i> Another thing that I would just like to confirm :

As the description of rabbitmq_tracing says... it &quot;Adds message tracing to the management plugin. Logs messages from the firehose in a couple of formats.&quot;. So the actual tracing is done by the firehose (<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/firehose.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/firehose.html</A>), and that's what 'rabbitmqctl trace_{on,off}' controls. Hence even without the rabbitmq_tracing plug-in, there is a cost to running with tracing enabled.

Matthias.
