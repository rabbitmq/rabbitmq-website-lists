Hi.

</I>
Bear in mind that the &quot;empty queue and excess workers&quot; case *is* on the 
critical path for straight-through messaging (i.e. where the queue is on 
average empty and we are streaming messages through it as fast as possible).

&gt;<i> And we are going
</I>&gt;<i> to do very little work unless the queue has a behaviour where it empties
</I>&gt;<i> often in which case you get full random distribution on the consumers
</I>&gt;<i> with this scheme.
</I>
Again, this is a common case for some users.

Also: quite a lot of people *want* round-robin behaviour here.

&gt;<i> The background for the proposal is that Round-robin distribution of
</I>&gt;<i> messages often tend to bad behaviour over time. By adding a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> randomness to the process, we automatically alleviate a number of
</I>&gt;<i> determinism-problems and get better distribution of messages over
</I>&gt;<i> consumers. One could also imagine different distribution schemes, but
</I>&gt;<i> those will be more expensive in practice compared to this proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> which should only have a cost when the queue is not under heavy load.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Did I miss anything?
</I>&gt;<i> * Is this a good or bad idea? And why?
</I>&gt;<i> * Do we break any rules w.r.t. AMQP by implementing this?
</I>&gt;<i> * Is priority on the queue going to be harder to implement? (I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think so, but...)
</I>
So I am not (yet) convinced. This would not violate the spec or make 
priorities harder to implement but I'm not convinced that the majority 
of users would see it as a step forward.

Does anybody who currently depends on round-robin want to speak up?

Cheers, Simon
