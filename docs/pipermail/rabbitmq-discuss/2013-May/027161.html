</I>&gt;<i> A RAM-disk will guarantee that messages don't reach secondary storage,

</I>We have a RabbitMQ cluster, so we could make sure that the RamDisk would
be set up only on those servers that have those kind of queues.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An alternative option would be to set the vm_memory_high_watermark to a
</I>&gt;<i> very large factor (e.g. 100). The broker will then behave as if it had
</I>&gt;<i> alot more memory than it really has (and therefore it runs the risk of
</I>&gt;<i> crashing with an out-of-memory error). At the moment the broker may
</I>&gt;<i> start sending messages to disk when as little as 5% of RAM is in use.
</I>&gt;<i> Setting the vm_memory_high_watermark high enough that this threshold is
</I>&gt;<i> never reached should avoid disk writes.
</I>Cool. Thanks for the tips/info. For this cases the ZeroMQ approach sounds
quite attractive (at least on paper), that you can assign &quot;swap&quot; size on 
a per
queue level, see <A HREF="http://www.zeromq.org/whitepapers:design-v06">http://www.zeromq.org/whitepapers:design-v06</A>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you explain why you want to avoid messages in disk? We have been
</I>&gt;<i> asked about this feature before, but the request has never been
</I>&gt;<i> accompanied by a strong motivating argument.
</I>The requirement comes from legal to not infringe Copyright laws (in
different countries). Apparently (and I'm not a legal person, so don't
really ask me any details), it's ok to keep the content in memory, but
not to &quot;store it to disk&quot;. It is a bit unknown what the &quot;store to disk&quot;
really means, and therefore I think it's preferred to be on the safe side
and make sure (with reasonable effort) that the message is never
written to disk.
