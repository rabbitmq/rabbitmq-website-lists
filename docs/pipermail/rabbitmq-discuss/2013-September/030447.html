So, just to be clear, you want to write a program that does the following:

1) for all bindings that need to be created, check whether the binding 
already exists

2) if the binding does not exist then create it and remember that

3) when the program finishes, delete all the bindings that were created 
in step (2)

The above would be fantastically racy. What if some other program added 
or deleted a binding between step 1 and 2?

An alternative, non-racy approach would be to make the bindings unique 
to the program by adding some a program invocation specific GUID to the 
binding arguments.
