<PRE>Dear rabbitmq.com,

My name is Dessyre and I 'm Indonesian. I interested to use rabbitmq but i
have some problem for implementation. I want to use RPC for my 2 websites.
It's just to show the database from website as a server(website A) to
website  as a client (website B ). Maybe it will be help, if i use example.
Website A is a student data collection website from A university. Every
student can register themselves to this website just for name, id_student
and address. Website B is a goverment website that want to display data
from each university. if one student edit and update her/his data then the
data will be automatically be updated on the website A and B. And if come
website C as a client that want to have the same thing, i just make a
connection with the queue. Am I right???

Maybe it's so simple but I'm really new here. I confuse how to start. I
already finish make a dummy website by symfony framework. But I don't know
what the next. Please help me. Please, Thank you very much.
