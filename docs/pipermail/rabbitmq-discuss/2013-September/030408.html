<PRE>Yep, really. I can't recall the error message though but after creating the cluster the web management plugin was enabled again.

If you try to create a cluster on a single machine then you need to configure management to open a different port for each node. But clusters where every node runs management are definitely supported (and indeed rather common). What error message did you see?
