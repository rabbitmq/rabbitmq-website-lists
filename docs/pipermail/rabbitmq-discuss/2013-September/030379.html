You should be able to recover the 'not found' bindings by a) recreating 
the queues (as you already have) and then b) stopping the entire cluster 
(i.e. no node must be left running) and restarting it.

&gt;<i> Regarding #2, if you need anything else from me, please let me know!
</I>
There is no smoking gun in the logs, so the likely source of the problem 
is some edge case error in the mirroring and/or recovery logic. That may 
take us a while to track down. I don't think there's any other info we 
need from your running cluster. Thanks for reporting this issue.


Regards,

Matthias.
