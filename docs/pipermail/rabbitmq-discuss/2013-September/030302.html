But was that *always* the case? Would be good to see the logs all the 
way from the time of the upgrade.

Yes, that should be the case.

Hard to know without understanding what the problem is. Is this
reproducible at all? e.g. do you have a queue *now* that is suffering
from this behaviour?

Matthias.
