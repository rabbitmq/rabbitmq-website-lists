<PRE>Hello.

We are experiencing troubles with Java clients connecting to Rabbit over 
SSL. Two problems caused by the very same issue:
* When DNS server takes more than 5 seconds in reverse resolving IP 
address back to name, Rabbit aborts the connection. I assume Java SSL 
layer does that lookup AFTER the TCP connection is already established 
in order to decide which client certificate to provide.
* When Java client is running on a limited processing power hardware, it 
again takes it more than 5 seconds to finish the SSL handshake and 
again, Rabbit server resets the connection.

I saw that reply from Emile which states SSL_TIMEOUT is not configurable 
<A HREF="http://rabbitmq.1065348.n5.nabble.com/Request-Handshake-Timeout-Increase-tt11342.html#a11346">http://rabbitmq.1065348.n5.nabble.com/Request-Handshake-Timeout-Increase-tt11342.html#a11346</A>
And as I see in the sources, nothing has changed since then.

So my question is - do you have any plans for fixing it in the near future?
Are there any options we can modify it at runtime without rebuilding 
Rabbit? Having custom build server is the least thing we want.

Timeout of 5s is just too short really. 10 works for us but configurable 
would be even better.

Many thanks!
