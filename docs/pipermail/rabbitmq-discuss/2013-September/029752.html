<PRE>All of the consumer channels exhibit this sawtooth behavior. They also peak 
out at 40 messages/sec, which seems low since the prefetch is set at 200. 
Has anyone else seen this behavior?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Broadly, we're seeing a lower delivery rate than publish rate. I've 
</I>&gt;<i> attached an image to this message that shows how we're able to keep up when 
</I>&gt;<i> the publish rate is less than 600 messages/second, but above that, 
</I>&gt;<i> consumption falls behind publication. Around 16:00 on that chart, we 
</I>&gt;<i> doubled the number of consumers, and it made no difference that we could 
</I>&gt;<i> tell. The erratic behavior of the publish rate is us turning off publishes 
</I>&gt;<i> of the most active queue because we were falling far enough behind that we 
</I>&gt;<i> became worried. When the backlog would get low enough, we would turn it 
</I>&gt;<i> back on, and we did that a few times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are some vitals to our cluster:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - 2 nodes
</I>&gt;<i>    - Each node is a m1.xlarge instance hosted in EC2
</I>&gt;<i>    - We have 133 queues in the cluster (see note below)
</I>&gt;<i>    - All queues are mirrored (they all use a policy that makes them 
</I>&gt;<i>    highly available)
</I>&gt;<i>    - All queues are durable; we use AWS provisioned IOPS to guarantee 
</I>&gt;<i>    enough throughput
</I>&gt;<i>    - We only use the direct exchange
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the number of queues, there are four kinds: the &quot;main&quot; queues, 
</I>&gt;<i> retry-a queues, retry-b queues, and poison queues. Messages that fail for 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever reason during consumption will get put into the retry queues, and 
</I>&gt;<i> if they fail long enough, they'll wind up in the poison queue where they 
</I>&gt;<i> will stay until we do something with them manually much later. The main 
</I>&gt;<i> queues then see the majority of activity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The average message size is less than 1MB. At nearly one million messages, 
</I>&gt;<i> we were still under 1GB of memory usage, and our high watermark is 5.9GB. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Disk IOPS don't appear to be the problem. Metrics indicated we still had 
</I>&gt;<i> plenty of headroom. Furthermore, if IOPS were the limitation, I would have 
</I>&gt;<i> expected the delivery rate to increase as the publish rate decreased while 
</I>&gt;<i> the consumers worked through the queue. It did not, however, as shown on 
</I>&gt;<i> the chart.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My question primarily is: *What do you think is limiting our consumption 
</I>&gt;<i> rate?* I'm curious about what affects consumption rate in general, 
</I>&gt;<i> though. Any advice would be appreciated at this point. Questions for 
</I>&gt;<i> clarification are also welcome!
