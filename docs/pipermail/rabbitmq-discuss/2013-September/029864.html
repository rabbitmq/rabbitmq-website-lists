<PRE>Hi guys,

after complaining about RabbitMQ HA mode in twitter[1], I got a response by 
&#193;lvaro (@old_sound)[2] stating that I should post my problem here. Fair 
enough, here are my details:

Architecture: simple RabbitMQ 2.8.x cluster with two machines. 
Usage: really simple pub-sub on a topic. Nothing fancy. Queues on 'all' 
mirroring.
Library: node-amqp for Node.js [3], v0.1.7, as published on npm, not on 
github)

The symptons are:

1) We connect to several logical brokers from each of our nodes. This means 
that we are connected to the master and slaves of each queue.
2) When the master fails, RabbitMQ selects the eldest slave and promotes to 
be the master.
3) &quot;The slave considers all previous consumers to have been abruptly 
disconnected.&quot;[4] So we end up with the connections NOT being closed but 
not binded to any queue, and no information from RabbitMQ to the &quot;slave&quot; 
consumers. This means that we have the connection, we do not have any error 
message, but we stop receiving any further messages.

I have read the documentation and I think this is the expected behaviour, 
but I'm more than open to improve our code to solve this problems.

Thanks,

Guillermo
