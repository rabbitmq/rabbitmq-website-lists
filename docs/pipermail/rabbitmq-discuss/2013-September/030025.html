Thanks for the bug report.

So it looks what is happening is a queue is in the process of being 
deleted while the vhost that contains it is also being deleted. I assume 
you have a user who is busy churning queues while you delete their user 
/ vhost?

At the moment that doesn't appear to be safe. We'll fix this in a future 
release, but for the time being you can work around this with something 
like:

* Remove user permissions to vhosts
* (Remove user if that's what you want to do)
* Kill all connections to the vhost
* Delete the vhost

Cheers, Simon
