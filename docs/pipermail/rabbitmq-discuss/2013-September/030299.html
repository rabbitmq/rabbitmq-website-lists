That happens when the binding in question exists but the 'home' node of 
the (durable) queue is not alive. In case of a mirrored queue that would 
imply that all mirrors are down. Essentially both the queue and 
associated bindings are in a limbo state at that point - they neither 
exist nor do they not exist.

So when you see the above error, please check whether the queue you are 
binding actually exists, i.e. shows up in 'rabbitmqctl list_queues'. If 
it does not then you are seeing normal behaviour. Otherwise there's a bug.

Matthias.
