<PRE>Many thanks Steve! A excellent summary. I've updated my blog post. Thanks
especially for clarifying how the threading around consumers works. I'm
using the .NET client. Is it a straight port of the Java client, or are
there significant differences?

Cheers
Mike

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to butt in, but I wanted to clarify a few things (about the Java
</I>&gt;<i> client):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is *no* &#8216;rule&#8217; &#8220;you shouldn&#8217;t share a channel between threads&#8221;.  It
</I>&gt;<i> is (good) advice, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is *not* true that &#8220;basic.deliver will be called on the client
</I>&gt;<i> library&#8217;s internal message loop thread&#8221;, handleDelivery is called on a
</I>&gt;<i> Consumer callback thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is fine to call ack from a Consumer.handleDelivery method, and it is
</I>&gt;<i> OK to call any other channel method, *but* it is hard to program
</I>&gt;<i> multi-thread control of a channel without getting into serious difficulties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some channel commands don't wait for a response, and some do.  If you are
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for a response then your application thread is waiting (blocked).
</I>&gt;<i> If you issue a second command that wants to wait for a response, the Java
</I>&gt;<i> Client will block the second thread until the response has returned from
</I>&gt;<i> the first.  This is thread-safe, and as designed.  However, there is no
</I>&gt;<i> serialisation of these requests: if many simultaneously issue commands,
</I>&gt;<i> they may execute in any order.  The state of the channel each command sees
</I>&gt;<i> is therefore not predictable, and so the application threads need to cope
</I>&gt;<i> with potential failures and reorderings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even commands that don't expect a response can interfere with another
</I>&gt;<i> thread's commands by changing the state of the channel, so it is quite
</I>&gt;<i> important that the application threads know what each other are doing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Issuing acks from many threads runs the risk of a double ack (acking the
</I>&gt;<i> same message twice), which is a protocol error.  Multi-acks suffer from
</I>&gt;<i> the same problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I refer you to the following sections on the Java Client API documentation
</I>&gt;<i> page (<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html</A>):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Channel thread-safety
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Channel instances are safe for use by multiple threads. Requests into a
</I>&gt;<i> Channel are serialized, with only one thread being able to run a command
</I>&gt;<i> on the Channel at a time. Even so, applications should prefer using a
</I>&gt;<i> Channel per thread instead of sharing the same Channel across multiple
</I>&gt;<i> threads.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and, in the following section:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Callbacks to Consumers are dispatched on a thread separate from the
</I>&gt;<i> thread managed by the Connection. This means that Consumers can safely
</I>&gt;<i> call blocking methods on the Connection or Channel, such asqueueDeclare,
</I>&gt;<i> txCommit, basicCancel or basicPublish.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each Channel has its own dispatch thread. For the most common use case of
</I>&gt;<i> one Consumer per Channel, this means Consumers do not hold up other
</I>&gt;<i> Consumers. If you have multiple Consumers per Channel be aware that a
</I>&gt;<i> long-running Consumer may hold up dispatch of callbacks to other Consumers
</I>&gt;<i> on that Channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are interested&#8230;.  (background info):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It *used to be the case* that the consumer callbacks (e.g. handleDelivery)
</I>&gt;<i> executed on the Connection thread. (This is no longer true&#8212;see below.)
</I>&gt;<i> This meant it was quite dangerous to issue channel commands in a callback
</I>&gt;<i> method:  the same thread that listened for frames from the server, might
</I>&gt;<i> block waiting for a response from a channel command.  *Deadlock.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The basic.ack command was alright, because there is no response waited
</I>&gt;<i> for (and any other command which doesn&#8217;t have a protocol response is fine,
</I>&gt;<i> too).  However, many applications tried to issue channel commands (like
</I>&gt;<i> declareQueue or createChannel) which *did* expect responses, so they ran
</I>&gt;<i> into trouble.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To obviate this problem, the QueueingConsumer was created: this
</I>&gt;<i> essentially does all the necessary things in the callback to receive the
</I>&gt;<i> message, puts it in a (communicating, thread-safe) Java queue, and returns.
</I>&gt;<i>  The message can then be obtained from the Java queue by any other thread,
</I>&gt;<i> including the original application thread.  If channel commands are
</I>&gt;<i> subsequently issued they cannot block the Connection thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Issuing channel commands from more than one thread ran the risk of issuing
</I>&gt;<i> a command requiring a response (a &#8216;synchronous&#8217; command) while another
</I>&gt;<i> thread was already waiting for a response.  This would be an error (a
</I>&gt;<i> thread-safety error) because the client cannot cope with overlapping
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous commands on the same channel.  This is prevented: a thread that
</I>&gt;<i> issues a command expecting a response will block until any outstanding
</I>&gt;<i> response is received on that channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although the thread-safety issues are (should be&#8212;let&#8217;s not get complacent)
</I>&gt;<i> now all fixed, this solution just made a deadlock on the Connection thread
</I>&gt;<i> more likely if you were trying to code your own Consumer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In RabbitMQ 2.7.0 and 2.7.1, the Java client was changed to take the
</I>&gt;<i> callback executions off of the Connection thread altogether. This was for
</I>&gt;<i> three reasons.  *One* was to allow channel commands to be issued in
</I>&gt;<i> handleDelivery (*et al.*), which, by the way, meant that bespoke Consumers
</I>&gt;<i> were easier to write&#8212;QueueingConsumer is now not (so) necessary.  The *
</I>&gt;<i> second* was to recover more gracefully from Consumers that do silly
</I>&gt;<i> things: throwing exceptions, hanging indefinitely, and so on.  And the *
</I>&gt;<i> third* was to prevent Consumers on *distinct* channels from holding each
</I>&gt;<i> other up.  (There is now a pool of threads used to execute Consumer callbacks,
</I>&gt;<i> each channel&#8217;s callbacks being executed serially, but distinct channels&#8217;
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks being allowed to run concurrently.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is quite safe to issue an ack (or nack) from another thread.  But you
</I>&gt;<i> should beware of doing this twice, so multi-threaded applications need to
</I>&gt;<i> be carefully designed to avoid &#8216;confusion&#8217; over which thread does
</I>&gt;<i> what&#8212;&#8220;channel control fights&#8221;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Channel commands can be issued from multiple threads if you can ensure
</I>&gt;<i> that the correct channel protocol is observed.  To do this properly
</I>&gt;<i> requires communication between the threads in the application, which can be
</I>&gt;<i> non-trivial to get right (I recommend *Java Concurrency in Practice*,
</I>&gt;<i> Addison Wesley, Goetz, et al.).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, the &#8216;*advice*&#8217; is *not* to share channels between application
</I>&gt;<i> threads, but it is *just advice*.  It is expected that you might issue (n)
</I>&gt;<i> acks from the Consumer handleDelivery method, and put other Channel method
</I>&gt;<i> calls there, too.  No rules are being &#8216;broken&#8217;.
