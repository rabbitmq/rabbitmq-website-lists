<PRE>Hi rabbitmq gurus

  In our environment, there is a probability that 
  a portion of our outside consumers  will &quot;come and go away after a
while&quot; ...

  Except for the rabbitmq-management plugin, there is no rabbitmqctl
command to
  delete a queue... is this right !?

  So the only way to delete an unwanted queue will be to code something 
  using the administrator user that will delete a queue using its
name... is that right !? 
  It is possible using PIKA ?

More details about message leaking

My publishers all open one connection, uses 1 channel and declare and
feed the same exchange (exchange with auto-delete = true)

When I start the publishers the exchange is created and receives
(publish-in) messages.

Than running my consumer :
it opens one connection, uses 1 channel, creates a queue
(auto-delete=true) and declare the same exchange (auto-delete=true)  and
bind the exchange  to its queue everything runs smoothly.

When I stop my consumer the exchange is deleted in the rabbitmq server
(rabbitmq-management shows that)
even if the publishers are still feeding ???   Is this normal ?

Restarting the consumer, the exchange is &quot;recreated&quot;  but it seems that
some (or sometimes all) the bindings with the publishers are broken ???

This is how I am losing messages

Rabbitmq 3.1.5 


What do I do wrong ?

No error on the producer/publisher side
No errors/warnings in  RabbitMQ log.

I have installed PIKA, and used their asynchronous consumer example and
so far (over the all the weekend) I wasn't able to reproduce the
problem...

This seems to point to my consumer...  will post something if it happens
again.

Thanks

Grenier,Michel:

&gt;<i> than  for no apparent reason,  my consumer is missing  some messages 
</I>&gt;<i> from one producer...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    The producer still sends messages...   I simply restart the
</I>producer and the problem is resolved...

Is your producer report any errors? Are there any errors or warnings in
RabbitMQ log (if you have it, please post it to the list).

Does it work better if you try Pika (a different Python client)?
