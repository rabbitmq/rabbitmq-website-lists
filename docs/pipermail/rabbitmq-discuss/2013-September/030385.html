<PRE>For those of you following along... We did as Matthias suggested, stopping
all the RabbitMQ nodes in the cluster, then restarted them.

After restarting, the bindings were there and working!  We did not need to
rebind.  So it seems that the bindings were really there all along, but
they were in some kind of weird latent state where they were not actually
active.  Bringing down the whole cluster and restarting it seems to have
resolved the issue.

In case it is of any importance, I will also mention that when we stopped
the cluster, nodes 2 and 5 did not stop gracefully-- they just hung.  So we
had to kill beam on those nodes.

Thanks again for your help.

-Chris
