<PRE>Thanks Michael for your response , however I have another question , rabbit is best for propagation and routing and is not a database  , I am designing a social based system and I have my users in the database .
e.g Jack follows john , john follows jack
So when jack makes a post I write the post to my db and deliver the message to john by writing to johns exchange .John gets the message by waiting on a queue based on any message written to his exchange.is this the right approach to designing a social system with rabbitmq ?, thanks.

The main difference in starting in these two ways is that the server is 
run as root in the latter case, rather than the &quot;rabbitmq&quot; user. The 
failed startup also failed due to &quot;undef&quot; - i.e. the Erlang VM could not 
find the definition for a module.

I therefore wonder if the permissions of the server code have been 
changed somehow so that the &quot;rabbitmq&quot; user can't read it. If so, the 
easiest way to fix the permissions is probably to remove the deb and 
reinstall it.

Cheers, Simon

Thanks alvaro like I said this concept is totally new to me , however I would like to know if the consumers would run stand alone , that is apart from the web server ? , if that is the case does it mean I would have to keep my command line open always on my servers?

Sir/Madam,
                 This is for first time I am using RabbitMQ. After
searching, I come to know that first I have to install RabbitMq sever and
after doing that I used a code sample given in rabbitMq's official site.I
am pasting that code here also. I also tried to search the resolution of
this error but I am not able to get it's solution. This is a request to
please help me as soon as it can br possible.

Actually, the problem is that createConnection() method is throwing an
exception and the exception is &quot;BrokerUnreachableException was Unhandled&quot;.

Please HELP ASAP.

Thanks.

Hello All,

I would like to federate all messages to the default unnamed queue - is
this possible?  I have tried variations of pattern matching nothing, but
believe I'll need to alter my publishing behaviour.  True or false?

Thanks in advance,

Greg

Sukhjeet,

Can you please be a bit more specific about

 * What the stack trace look like
 * How did you install RabbitMQ
 * If it is running
 * If there's anything in the log
 * What tutorial are you following and for what language

Then it will be much easier to provide specific advice.

MK

It's the default exchange that is &quot;unnamed&quot; (clients specify an empty string to refer to it).
Queue federation will be supposed in the next release (3.2). Are you talking about
exchanges?

&gt;<i>  I have tried variations of pattern matching nothing, but believe I'll need to alter my publishing behaviour.
</I>
It should be possible to federate any exchange, as far as I know. Can you post some specific
federation configuration examples and you code, and explain what your queues and bindings
setup is?

Hi,

If by &quot;unnamed queue&quot; you mean the default exchange with no name, then no,
you can't federate that exchange.

Regards,

Alvaro

What do you mean by this? You can just run the PHP consumer directly on the
webserver process, although I wouldn't recommend doing that since you would
end up blocking all the server threads.

Is there a reason why you don't want to run the consumer from the command
line directly?

Alvaro

I think it was set to default value which is 600. I changed it to 30 seconds on upstream.
Now it detects the failure in around a minute and changes the link.

This behavior was observed when both links were up, but we just stopped and started the downstream broker. 
Bindings were not changed, there was only one queue listening to downstream stream with '#' routing key.
I will use tracer when I observe this next time.

No, not at the moment. Currently we just ask Mnesia whenever we need to

Well, you can invoke rabbit_mnesia:cluster_nodes(running) or 
rabbit_mnesia:cluster_nodes(all) or whatever.

No, that's the other way round - used to tell the node monitor that a 
node has joined.

What are you trying to do?

As Alvaro pointed out, it's any exchange other than the default exchange 
(since the &quot;default exchange&quot; really just means &quot;publish to queue&quot;).

I'll update the documentation to make this clearer.

The clue's in the name. The broker was not reachable. Catch the 
exception to find out more, but I would bet that you haven't pointed the 
ConnectionFactory at the broker.

A plugin could subscribe to Mnesia system events that will report when
Mnesia stops and starts on nodes:
 <A HREF="http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/Mnesia_chap5.html#id76679">http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/Mnesia_chap5.html#id76679</A>

Depending on the kind of plugin you are writing you could use the
information sent to the log exchange (amq.rabbitmq.log) to determine
when nodes leave and join.

</I>
...the producer is expecting replies on an exclusive, server-named queue.

Clearly that isn't going to work. And because the 'logs' exchange is 
also the exchange on which the consumer queue is bound you end up with 
the 'infinite loop' at the consumer since the response published by the 
consumer will be consumed by the consumer!

You need to change your consumer to publish the response to the default 
exchange ('') with the routing_key taken from props.reply_to of the request.

Just run the process in the background (daemonized).

Hi there!

For example, I have 3 consumers on 1 queue.
If I set prefetch_count = 1, then server will use round-robin algorithm:
1st message to consumer1
2nd message to consumer2
3rd message to consumer3
4th message to consumer1 and so on.

But how does strategy changes when prefetch_count !=1? (for example 10)
Will server push 10 messages to consumer1, next 10 to 2 and so on?

And if prefetch_count = 1 but 1st consumer has already processed his
message? Will server send new message again to consumer1? Or in any cases
next message will be sent to consumer2?

It's round robin between consumers that haven't gone above the basic.qos
setting
for their channel. With prefetch &gt; 1 it's just harder to see because you
have more
messages in flight.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi All,

Are channel best practices for connected RabbitMQ clients published
anywhere? I understand the threading limitations, that channels should not
be shared between threads. Does the channel concept exist only to support
multi-threaded applications, or does it have some other purpose?

If I marshal all calls to a channel onto a single thread in my application
code, is there any problem with simply maintaining a single channel for all
declares, publishes and consumes?

Additional questions:

1. Should each basic consume be invoked on a dedicated channel?

2. Do I need to basic.ack on the same channel on which I invoked
basic.consume?

Many thanks
Mike

Yes, rabbitmq_jsonrpc_channel is broken in 3.1.5 I'm afraid. It will be

&gt;<i> Does the channel concept exist only to support multi-threaded

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It was added to avoid having N TCP connections from the same client in case
it needs to have multiple logical connections.


&gt;<i> If I marshal all calls to a channel onto a single thread in my application
</I>&gt;<i> code, is there any problem with simply maintaining a single channel for all

Should be fine.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additional questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Should each basic consume be invoked on a dedicated channel?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If you want to have N consumers from the same OS process, it's not strictly
necessary.


&gt;<i> 2. Do I need to basic.ack on the same channel on which I invoked
</I>&gt;<i> basic.consume?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You must ack/nack/reject on the same channel the delivery was on because
delivery_tag is
scoped per channel.

A good reason to use more than one channel is error handling, which in many
cases is per-channel.
For example, if you expect an exception for one operation that you can
recover from, you can use
a separate channel to make sure the connection closure caused by the
exception does not affect other operations in the same VM.

No, it's a bug. I'm sure it used to work the way you describe.

The channel concept exists (in AMQP) to provide a lightweight alternative to having one TCP connection per client, since the latter are resource intensive (to both client and server's detriment). Multiplexing multiple &quot;clients&quot; over a single TCP connection turns out to be a fairly common approach amongst network intensive applications. Channels also provide a unit of atomicity with regards message ordering, i.e., messages are always fully (FIFO) ordered from client to server over a single channel, whereas there are no ordering guarantees regarding messages concurrently sent (or delivered) over multiple channels.

One problem you might run into relates to the answer I've given below about correlating ACKs with the correct channel.

&gt;<i> Additional questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Should each basic consume be invoked on a dedicated channel?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That's not strictly necessary, though neither is it wrong. Depending on your application logic, you might find that introduces unnecessary overhead (in terms of threads and associated synchronisation primitives used in the client and/or additional resource use on the server), so if I were you I would only do it if it is (a) necessary or (b) significantly simplifies your client code. Remember that a channel provides a FIFO ordering guarantee, so having multiple consumers on a single channel means that you're potentially dealing with messages from more than one source queue, in which case you might inadvertently introduce a serial bottleneck. 

&gt;<i> 2. Do I need to basic.ack on the same channel on which I invoked basic.consume?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes, that is absolutely necessary. An ACK sent on another channel to the one on which the delivery was received will be treated as a channel error.

Cheers,
Tim

Thanks Michael, Tim. great answers.

One more channel question:

You shouldn't share a channel between multiple threads, but given that an
ACK should be sent on the same channel that the delivery is received mean
that one _must_ violate this rule? I call basic.consume on my application
thread, but basic.deliver will be called on the client library's internal
message loop thread and then the ACK will no doubt be called on a separate
application thread (where I de-queue the message from my queuing consumer).
Is this violation of the do-not-use-channels-on-multiple-threads rule OK?

Thanks
Mike

If you run one consumer per thread, use a new channel for every one of them.

This version adds filtering on routing key and/or grep on the message
body. Filtering is available on the list messages endpoint and
outputs.

# Fetch messages containing a line starting with a number
# The -g option to curl stops it from messing with [] and {}
# The %2b is the + character url encoded
$ curl -g &quot;<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?grep=^[0-9]%2b&quot;">http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?grep=^[0-9]%2b&quot;</A>

# Fetch messages with routingKey matching a RabbitMQ expression
# The hash (#) must be url encoded as %23
$ curl &quot;<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?routingKey=foo.*.%23&quot;">http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?routingKey=foo.*.%23&quot;</A>

# Fetch messages with routingKey matching a Java regular expression
$ curl -g &quot;<A HREF="http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?routingKey=/^[0-9]%2b/&quot;">http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?routingKey=/^[0-9]%2b/&quot;</A>

&gt;<i> What are you trying to do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I want to have a plugin that works with a concept of topics and partitioned
queues. What does this mean?

I want to create a topic called &quot;my_topic&quot; which implies having a
consistent hash exchange (CHE) called &quot;my_topic&quot; + one queue called
&quot;node_name.my_topic&quot; bound to the my_topic exchange. The queue message
contents should live in the &quot;node_name&quot; node.

Whenever a node joins the cluster, I want to automatically declare a queue
called &quot;new_node.my_topic&quot; and bind it to the &quot;my_topic&quot; CHE. That queue
will be declared on new_node, so the message contents would end up in that
node.

With this I want to achieve some sort of &quot;partitioned queues&quot;.

I plan this plugin to be an extension to the management plugin, so one
would create one of these topics via an HTTP call.

Also when connecting to a broker, one could ask this plugin via HTTP to
send the proper queue name for a particular topic, in order to consume from
it.

Does this makes sense?

Thanks for the clarification Simon. This feature would be a huge benefit
for us. The way it stands now, if someone wants access isolation within a
vhost, we have to spin up a new vhost and then create shovels if they need
to intercommunicate.

I took a shot at modifying and compiling the ldap plugin and came up with a
seemingly working solution. I'm just getting my feet wet with Erlang but
does this have any glaring issues at first glance? I'm basically adding a
new derived value to the Args list so that when it's sent to fill()
${prefix} is properly expanded.

My follow up question would be, what are the chances of getting something
similar to this added to the official code base?

James

Hi folks,

I was wondering why we don't support the connection_timeout amqp_params_network parameter in the amqp_uri:parse functions.

It seems to boil down to:

parse_amqp_param(Field, String) when Field =:= channel_max orelse
                                  Field =:= frame_max   orelse
                                  Field =:= heartbeat   -&gt;
 try return(list_to_integer(String))
 catch error:badarg -&gt; fail({not_an_integer, String})
 end;
parse_amqp_param(Field, String) -&gt;
 fail({parameter_unconfigurable_in_query, Field, String}).


Would it be possible to add connection_timeout to the guard expression?

Thanks!

-Fred

What do you mean by &quot;use rabbitmq in multiple users&quot;? You could have 
your application connect to the RabbitMQ broker with a single user and 
enforce permissions itself; many applications do this.

Or you could use RabbitMQ access control: see

Based on a quick look at the code, nothing is too wrong from a low level 
point of view. However, this is wrong:

case Predicate of
     true  -&gt; Var = Something;
     false -&gt; Var = SomethingElse
end,

since although Var happens to escape the inner scope in all cases, it's 
not very clear and modern Erlang compilers will complain. Instead you want:

Var = case Predicate of
           true  -&gt; Something;
           false -&gt; SomethingElse
       end,

However, I'd be reluctant to merge this; conceptually it's very specific 
to your use case - what if you want to match something other than up to 
the first '.'? What if you want to do that on something other than the 
resource name?

Really you want to be able to write something like ${name.prefix('.')}. 
That is (obviously) much more complicated though.

It's possible some half-way house could exist between these two 
extremes; if so I can't immediately think of it.

</I>Thanks for the feedback. You're right, the compiler didn't complain but
your way does makes more sense. I've updated the gist to reflect the
changes if anyone is following along.

As for use case specificity, I can see your point. Although, I'm struggling
to come up with a case where you would want to use a tokenized version of
anything other than name. Assuming name is the only thing that makes sense
you could potentially have a new attribute called 'prefix_delimiter' which
would be sent to the tokens function. If you wanted to add more
customization there could be 'prefix_depth' as well which controlled how
many tokens were returned.

These would be global settings but they do have a parallel to the native
user permission regex matching which I think makes sense. Going inline with
the logic like you mentioned would be flexible but I'm not sure how helpful
it would be to have individual delimiters for different resource types.
Delimiters seem like they would be more of a global decision for the entire
broker once a proper group name convention was decided on.

This is not possible at the moment. Also it will make RabbitMQ violate the

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;

Hi,

We currently run a two-node cluster with mirrored queues. We see a huge 
drop-off in throughput when our publishers or consumers connect to the 
non-home node for the queue. This was also confirmed outside of production 
with two fresh Vagrant VMs on both CentOS and Ubuntu, see 
gist <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/boffbowsh/6675281">https://gist.github.com/boffbowsh/6675281</A> and the Java Client 
MulticastMain example. Do others see this behaviour? We see this being 
easily mitigated by always connecting to the home node for the queue, and 
failing over if the home node goes down. However, we haven't yet been able 
to think of a nice clean way of ensuring clients always connect to this. We 
do have a dynamic LB at our disposal so we can create a sort of floating IP 
if that's easiest. 

Does anyone have any experience of this sort of setup in production, and 
can they provide any tips?

Many thanks,

Paul Bowsher

One of the cluster recovery configurations is &quot;ignore&quot;:




  *   ignore - Your network really is reliable. All your nodes are in a rack, connected with a switch, and that switch is also the route to the outside world. You don't want to run any risk of any of your cluster shutting down if any other part of it fails (or you have a two node cluster).

Does this mode effectively turn off the heartbeat? Is a node detected as partitioned but nothing done?

Thanks,

Ron

To: rabbitmq-discuss &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbitmq-discuss at lists.rabbitmq.com</A>&gt;
Message-ID:
	&lt;<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">CAPnH5kqhxEGF3jwXPZCBuCsN-6DoCmJvYb4UhARjZb6fEfLhCg at mail.gmail.com</A>&gt;
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

rabbitpy 0.5.0, a minimalistic, thread-safe, pythonic RabbitMQ client
library is now available on pypi:

<A HREF="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rabbitpy">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rabbitpy</A>

Documentation is available at <A HREF="http://rabbitpy.readthedocs.org">http://rabbitpy.readthedocs.org</A>

*Highlights*

- Simple, blocking Pythonic API
- A thread-based connection and IO management system that properly supports
AMQP 0.9.1 server to client RPC semantics.
- Support for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3
- Support for the up-coming Connection.Blocked feature in RabbitMQ:
<A HREF="http://next.rabbitmq.com/connection-blocked.html">http://next.rabbitmq.com/connection-blocked.html</A>

*Examples of Use*

A simple publisher for one-off message publishing:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; rabbitpy.publish('<A HREF="amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f',">amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f',</A>
                         exchange='test',
                         routing_key='example',
                         body='This is my test message',
                         properties={'content_type': 'text/plain'})

A simple consumer:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; with rabbitpy.consume('<A HREF="amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f',">amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f',</A>
'test') as c:
    ..    for message in c.next_message():
    ...         print message.properties['message_id']
    ...         print message.body
    ...         message.ack()
    ...
    856dfdc7-5ee3-4fc1-9635-977bf0043a9f
    {&quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;}

And a more complete consumer example:

    import rabbitpy
    with rabbitpy.Connection('<A HREF="amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f'">amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/%2f'</A>) as
conn:
        with conn.channel() as channel:
            queue = rabbitpy.Queue(channel, 'example')
            with queue.consumer() as consumer:
                for message in consumer.next_message():
                    print('Message:')
                    print(' Time: %s' % message.properties['timestamp'])
                    print(' Body: %s' % message.body)
                    message.ack()


*Development Status*

This library is still considered experimental, but the API is set is not
expected to change. Barring any bug-fix releases, the next version (0.6.0)
will be move the library from alpha development status to beta. Testers are
needed!

Please report any bugs to <A HREF="https://github.com/gmr/rabbitpy/issues">https://github.com/gmr/rabbitpy/issues</A>

Gavin

I meant to ask in this same message about the heartbeat interval set to 0 and how it is different for the cluster 'ignore' mode.

Cheers.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Cluster Recovery Modes

One of the cluster recovery configurations is &quot;ignore&quot;:




  *   ignore - Your network really is reliable. All your nodes are in a rack, connected with a switch, and that switch is also the route to the outside world. You don't want to run any risk of any of your cluster shutting down if any other part of it fails (or you have a two node cluster).

Does this mode effectively turn off the heartbeat? Is a node detected as partitioned but nothing done?

Thanks,

Ron

AMQP heartbeats are a feature to enable client and server to detect connection failures in a timely fashion), whereas clustering operates over a completely different network transport and uses a different protocol. So there's no connection between these two things.

&gt;<i> One of the cluster recovery configurations is &quot;ignore&quot;:

No - as mentioned above, AMQP heartbeats and clustering are orthogonal.

&gt;<i> Is a node detected as partitioned but nothing done?
</I>
Yes, that's pretty much what this recover mode does. The idea behind 'ignore' is to avoid any further loss of service. The other recovery modes can lead to one or more of the remaining (unpartitioned) nodes restarting in order to heal the cluster (see 'autoheal' mode) or total loss of service on some nodes if they reside in a minority island (see 'pause_minority' mode). 

Cheers,
Tim

Publishing to an arbitrary node increases intra-cluster traffic so this is expected.

In theory you can but given that messages can be requeued and delivering and processing
them rarely takes a fixed amount of time, it will be pretty inaccurate.

Hi ,
I trying Clustring in two machine .

but after changing *.erlang.cookie* file of slave machine .
That slave machine node getting down
 after that if i am running any command on the slave machine - 
like -

rabbitmqctl stop_app
rabbitmqctl -n <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">slave at host</A> status

it always saying could not connect  node name node down 


but if i am running this command in slave machine -
rabbitmqctl -n <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">master at host</A> status

Not so.

Commercial support is available from Pivotal for both vFabric RabbitMQ 
and open source RabbitMQ. The terms do differ between them.

The main differences are:

- vFabric RabbitMQ has a commercial license [0] whereas open source 
RabbitMQ is licensed under the MPL1.1 [1]
- vFabric RabbitMQ support can be purchased under a perpetual license 
whereas open source RabbitMQ is annual subscription only [2]
- the support window for a particular release of vFabric RabbitMQ is 
substantially longer (3yrs) than open source RabbitMQ (1yr) [3]
- the vFabric RabbitMQ release comes with a JMS client that is not 
available as part of the open source distribution [4]

That suggests that the .erlang.cookie files are not the same on both
nodes. Check that the cookie hash is identical as reported in the
logfile when the broker starts up.

Can you confirm that the slave is running when you experience these
failures? What does the slave logfile say?
