<PRE>Brian

Have you looked at pika?  <A HREF="http://github.com/tonyg/pika">http://github.com/tonyg/pika</A>

Sorry to be brief; I hope to reply at greater length in a couple of days.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to follow up on an issue that's been on our radar for a while, but
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't seen any updates on it and wanted to see what our options might be
</I>&gt;<i> here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have been leveraging the py-amqplib client library with rabbitmq, which
</I>&gt;<i> has performed quite well in our application with one main limitation.&#160; The
</I>&gt;<i> main issue we have with it is that it does not currently support the
</I>&gt;<i> Channel.Flow message from an AMQP broker - which means when the server tries
</I>&gt;<i> to prevent a producing client app from overloading the system, the client
</I>&gt;<i> ignores the message and continues sending.&#160; Since RabbitMQ will continue to
</I>&gt;<i> process until it allocates all of its memory, it dies a horrible death and
</I>&gt;<i> all of the messages in the broker are lost (reproduction steps below).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two basic questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) What are my alternatives here from a python client side?&#160; I have
</I>&gt;<i> periodically checked into this with Barry for the py-amqplib, but it appears
</I>&gt;<i> to involve a pretty significant code restructuring (if I remember correctly,
</I>&gt;<i> it had to do with the synchronous processing of messages).&#160; We need a fully
</I>&gt;<i> baked client, and Barry's client works well in normal situations - we just
</I>&gt;<i> need it to be more fault-tolerant in the heavy saturation cases to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> production failures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) If there are no viable options from a python client right now, what
</I>&gt;<i> prevents you guys from adding some code to the rabbitmq broker from simply
</I>&gt;<i> failing a connection that refuses to honor the Channel.Flow message when it
</I>&gt;<i> has been broadcast?&#160; I asked this back in 1.5.0 (or around there), and think
</I>&gt;<i> this would be a great safety mechanism to prevent a single rogue client from
</I>&gt;<i> bringing down a broker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any help here would be greatly appreciated.&#160; This has bitten us a few times
</I>&gt;<i> in the past and is the weakest part of our pipeline right now.&#160; We are able
</I>&gt;<i> to buffer our messages on disk on the producer side, so any stoppage at the
</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmq side would simply cause our producer app to retry a connection and
</I>&gt;<i> resume transmission.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't read this list as actively as I would like, but I didn't find any
</I>&gt;<i> recent posts on this from any searches I was able to come up with.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully the answer is out there and I have just missed it.&#160; Please let me
</I>&gt;<i> know if I need to give more info here to help drive the discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Brian
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ==== Reproduction steps ====
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Attached is my failure case test script.&#160; In a nutshell, the test is as
</I>&gt;<i> follows:
</I>&gt;<i> - Create non-auto-delete queue, bound to a topic
</I>&gt;<i> - Spam that topic using the attached script until it maxes out the memory on
</I>&gt;<i> the machine (luckily, my test box is only 2GB so this does not take too
</I>&gt;<i> long)
</I>&gt;<i> - You can see the alerts fire in the /var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit.log file, but
</I>&gt;<i> no active flag is set on the Channel object on the Python client side.
</I>&gt;<i> - One note is that I am talking to a 1.5.3 broker, but the Channel.Flow
</I>&gt;<i> should be working fine in that version, this is the client's handling that I
</I>&gt;<i> am focusing on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
