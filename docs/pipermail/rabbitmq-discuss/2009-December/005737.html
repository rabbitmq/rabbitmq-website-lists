<PRE>Hi
   We're looking at building an application that does a fair amount of
synchronous processing. However we are investigating using a queuing system
as a messaging bus because some of these processes are meant to be reliable.
Using a queue helps us guarantee that messages are dealt with and avoids us
having to right background processes to clean up after us.

There are, however, a fair number of operations that are not required to be
reliable and we are thinking of implementing these also through the queue
but use non persistent queues. Now the concern we have is the kinds of
latencies we might see. So I'd like to get general feedback on using this
approach.
thanks
Vishnu
