Give us some idea of the data rates you are expecting. I regularly  
publish 3000+ messages/second using ruby which isn't exactly known for  
its performance. :)  Latency is a millisecond or so for topic  
exchanges, and under 1 millisecond for direct and fanout exchanges.  
(Exchange type matters due to matching overhead.)

However, since you say that all processing is synchronous, the length  
of time to complete that process will be your gating factor.
