<PRE>Hi Vlad,

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will try to answer your questions.
</I>
Thanks for your swift reply.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it seems things have quite changed since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> September
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know, apart from replacing the amqp_connection:start with 
</I>&gt;<i> start_direct and start_network and the new approach with 
</I>&gt;<i> #amqp_params{}, the API remained the same.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, there has been a lot of refactoring behind the scenes, but we 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't touch the API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For instance the test suite seems to suggest one should be using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amqp_connection:start(Params) to create a new connection but, unless I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mistaken, that function doesn't exist and you must use directly either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start_network or start_direct.
</I>&gt;<i> The right way of starting a connection is using either of the 
</I>&gt;<i> functions start_network or start_direct in amqp_connection. The start 
</I>&gt;<i> function has been removed quite some time ago.
</I>
Thanks for clarifying this. I think there is one of the test module 
which might need some updates then.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, it's unclear whether or not you can safely reuse Connections 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> across
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> several erlang nodes concurrently or if there are some issues in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can I use one connection and cretae as many channels as I want? Should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel be on a per erlang process basis?
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I am aware both the connection and the channel processes 
</I>&gt;<i> have been designed to be used from multiple processes. They are in 
</I>&gt;<i> fact gen_server's.
</I>&gt;<i> Not only that creating a single connection with as many channels as 
</I>&gt;<i> you like is possible, but it is also the recommended style. The 
</I>&gt;<i> maximum number of channels is 65535 I think, unless it is specified 
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise by the server (RabbitMQ server doesn't specify another 
</I>&gt;<i> limit). That should probably be more than enough.
</I>
Should channels be on per process basis? Say I create a channel, can I 
publish more than once without having to wait for each ack? Or is there 
a sequential constraint so that the channel knows where to propagate the 
potential ack from the server

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have a gen_server where I direct all my AMQP calls (publish, etc.) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> within that gen_server I create a pool of connections. Should this pool
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reside in its own gen_server so that each connection belongs to one 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supervised erlang process? Currently I keep the pool within the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gen_server's state. But this means I'm concurrently using the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connection for different channels. Is that safe?
</I>&gt;<i> As answered above, you don't need to worry about using the connection 
</I>&gt;<i> from different processes. The connection process itself is a 
</I>&gt;<i> gen_server, and what you get with amqp_connection:start_network() is 
</I>&gt;<i> just the pid of the spawned connection process, that you can use from 
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere (any process) in your application.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure about your exact use case, but I think using a gen_server 
</I>&gt;<i> to interface with the RabbitMQ Erlang client is unnecessary.
</I>
Meaning I don't need a connection pool I suppose. Cool.


Thanks Vlad,
- Sylvain
