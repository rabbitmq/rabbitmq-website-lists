Our volume is low relative to Rabbit's capacity. I might see as many
as 30 calls per second, but latency is high (our apps).

</I>
Negligible a percent as our call roundtrip latency is typically quite high.

&gt;<i> - How many RPC timeouts were observed?
</I>&gt;<i> - Is RPC over Rabbit a good idea anyway?
</I>
It's overkill if you can by with a simple client/server topology. If a
system is likely to grow in complexity, the investment in messaging
patterns may well pay for itself with the flexibility it gains.

&gt;<i> Also, on an unrelated note, can anybody share any experiences of their

</I>&gt;<i> Rabbit needs to be rebooted periodically?
</I>
My only problem with Rabbit server has been when we're letting
messages pile up in queues. A couple issues here:

1. The boolean flags for exclusive, autodelete, etc. have, some subtle
(IMO) implications on some very important memory issues in the broker.
Once you get them sorted out, it's smooth sailing, but there is that
important learning curve.

2. Not having a message time to live or expiration means that you
*really* need to make sure that either your queues are auto deleted or
that you're keeping up with the inflow.

I understand that there are features planned (or have landed) that
help with these issues. But that's really the only set of problems
I've faced.
