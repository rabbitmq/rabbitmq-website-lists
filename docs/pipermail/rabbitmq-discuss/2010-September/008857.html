<PRE>One more thing I forgot to mention :

- The previous situation have been encountered with rabbitMQ 1.8.1  
broker.

I've started playing a bit with the latest release 2.0.0 and I m  
affraid that it looks like their are some regression or at least some  
semantic updates.

I've just modified the provided MultiCast main sample of the java  
client library to add a FlowListener interface on both Producer and  
Consumer,
and registering the flow listener on their respective Channel.

It looks like any listener is called back  when the alarm handler is  
set or cleared, while the producers are still paused / resumed
like their are to be.

Does it mean some evolution in the flow control inner mechanism of the  
message broker or a regression on the Java client stack ?

Furthermore, what about the deployment of the client stack on the  
Maven repository ?

Le 8 sept. 10 &#224; 11:33, <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">romary.kremer at gmail.com</A> a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> We are performing evaluation on rabbitmq message broker, and we  
</I>&gt;<i> currently encounter difficulties to understand how does flow control  
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Our application implies 10 000 peers producing messages  
</I>&gt;<i> periodically to a unique queue. This queue is listen asynchronously  
</I>&gt;<i> by another peer.
</I>&gt;<i> - All peer are written in Java, using amqp-client-1.8.1.
</I>&gt;<i> - The production rate of a single peer is 4 messages / hour
</I>&gt;<i> - We can simulate a time-consuming task in the consumer callback,  
</I>&gt;<i> simulating more or less fast consumer.
</I>&gt;<i> - we are using SSL certificate on the broker side to allow the peer  
</I>&gt;<i> to authenticate the broker.
</I>&gt;<i> 	- we have noticed that the use of SSL as dramatic incidence on the  
</I>&gt;<i> memory occupied by Rabbitmq process
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - we give us the possibility to add a second consumer to load- 
</I>&gt;<i> balance the consumption of messages
</I>&gt;<i> 	- we are using prefetch windows of 1 message to enable credit-based  
</I>&gt;<i> flow control in this case
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - we have settled several monitoring indicator on the broker side :
</I>&gt;<i> 	- virtual memory occupied by rabbitmq process
</I>&gt;<i> 	- cpu load
</I>&gt;<i> 	- queue depth
</I>&gt;<i> 	- disk occupation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - our test scenario is as follow:
</I>&gt;<i> 	- during the 5 first hours, all peers join in the party (prods and  
</I>&gt;<i> cons)
</I>&gt;<i> 	- after 5 hours, producers stop publishing messages
</I>&gt;<i> 	- the test goes on for a configurable duration to allow the  
</I>&gt;<i> consumer to finish emptying the queue
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> during long running tests, we have encountered strange behaviour due  
</I>&gt;<i> to flow control :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The queue depth starts to increase linearly for about 2 hours, these  
</I>&gt;<i> is coherent since the message throughput of the single consumer
</I>&gt;<i> is not enough to absorb message ingress. Memory occupation grow  
</I>&gt;<i> faster as well, until the memory watermark is reached on the broker  
</I>&gt;<i> side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From that point, the producers are indeed paused, as flow control  
</I>&gt;<i> request has been issued by the broker, but the consumer seems to be  
</I>&gt;<i> blocked
</I>&gt;<i> as well. The queue level is flatten at its top value until the end  
</I>&gt;<i> of the test, even when memory occupation lowered under the threshold.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By registering the FlowListener callback, we have noticed that not  
</I>&gt;<i> all of the producers are notified all the time the alarm handler is  
</I>&gt;<i> set.
</I>&gt;<i> Does this mean that the broker applies some heuristic to try not to  
</I>&gt;<i> block every body every time ?
</I>&gt;<i> Or does it mean that some of the channels have been somehow  
</I>&gt;<i> blacklisted by the broker ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could anybody explain how the blocking of consumer is assumed to be  
</I>&gt;<i> implemented ?
</I>&gt;<i> Does the call of Channel.publish() is someHow blocking the  
</I>&gt;<i> connection Thread ?
</I>&gt;<i> How come that the consumer connection is also blocked ?
</I>&gt;<i> Does the implementation of FlowListener interface may help to handle  
</I>&gt;<i> flow control request ?
</I>&gt;<i> (I thought at first glance that the flow control should be  
</I>&gt;<i> implemented by hand using this interface,
</I>&gt;<i> but looking at this <A HREF="http://hopper.squarespace.com/blog/2008/11/9/flow-control-in-rabbitmq.html">http://hopper.squarespace.com/blog/2008/11/9/flow-control-in-rabbitmq.html</A> 
</I>&gt;<i>  after all, it seems that it is not the case anyway)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Romary.
