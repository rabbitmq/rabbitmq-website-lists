That seems to be arguing that you shouldn't have to sudo to do the
build.  Which is something I completely agree with.

It also also says that you shouldn't need sudo to install textmate or
wget.  That's fair enough, I suppose.

But it doesn't address system services.  We package rabbitmq-server to
run as a system service, because that's the way most people will want to
run it.

If the hoembrew policy is that you should just run everything under your
user account, that seems very short-sighted to me.

</I>
So the question is whether that would continue to be the case if the
homebrew formula was updated to be comparable to the macports port.  The
macports port might be a lot more convenient to install if we cut all
the same corners.
