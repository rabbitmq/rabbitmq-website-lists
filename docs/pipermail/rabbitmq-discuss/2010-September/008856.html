</I>&gt;<i> 1. Across what time frame are Send/receive rates calculated (ie rolling 5 minute

</I>
At the moment they're instantaneous. Yeah, I know that's lame. In the 
future they'll become moving averages of some sort. And there will be 
graphs :)

&gt;<i> 2. Where does this leave the Status plugin? Will that become discontinued or is
</I>&gt;<i> that plugin's functionality complementary to this one? I'm asking because we
</I>&gt;<i> have set up a lot of monitoring based on that plugin's output.
</I>
Ultimately I see the management plugin replacing the status plugin. 
However the status plugin is pretty simple and it's hardly taking any of 
our time to keep it working, so I imagine that state of affairs could 
persist for quite a while. I doubt it'll see any development though.

Having said that, if you're using the JSON page generated by the status 
plugin then the management plugin can provide the same stuff with a 
couple of queries, so you'll probably find porting quite easy if you 
want to do that.

&gt;<i> Feature requests:
</I>&gt;<i> Forgive me if these are already there, I haven't installed it yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Rabbit MQ App Memory usage, Node Memory allocation, Queue Memory Use
</I> &gt; 2. Queue stats

Those are all there.

&gt;<i> 3. Ability to clear queues (a la BQL's purge queue&lt;queue-name&gt;)
</I>
I hadn't thought of that. I'll add it to the list.

&gt;<i> 4. Importing / exporting broker state (a la BQL)
</I>
That seems to be a popular request. It's on the list too.

&gt;<i> 5. Ability to isolate plugin failures from taking down RabbitMQ - (ie run the
</I>&gt;<i> plugin on a single RAM node in a cluster that no apps connect to, but from this
</I>&gt;<i> node monitor the status of other nodes in the cluster)
</I>
At the moment the management plugin isn't very sensible in the context 
of clustering, but that will get fixed. I would hope the plugin should 
not be capable of taking down Rabbit though. If it ever does I most 
certainly want to hear about it!

&gt;<i> 6. Configurable permissions to lock down what can be done through the plugin
</I>
The short-term plan is to add a superuser bit to define whether users 
can manipulate non-AMQP objects (users / vhosts / permissions) at all. 
For AMQP objects the existing permission  system is used. Would this be 
adequate?

Cheers, Simon
