<PRE>I just wanted to thank everyone for all their input on this thread.
It has been really helpful.

As some folks have pointed out we are keen to improve the docs.  The
site grew and grew and got a little chaotic.  It is being improved.
Certainly we will be adding some 'get started in small steps' info
too.  If anyone would like to contribute, especially with patterns and
examples, let us know.

The roadmap question is a really interesting one for us.  To what
extent is it better to push forward quickly with broadening the reach
and possible use of Rabbit, versus strengthening its core?  Over time,
we try to do both, but at any given moment we may be leaning more in
one direction vs the other.  What are the best places where we can
engage with the community to achieve this?

I'm very interested in people's thoughts on this ;-)
