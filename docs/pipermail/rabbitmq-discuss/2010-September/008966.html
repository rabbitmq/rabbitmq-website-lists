Hi Romary,

That is too high. It is not advised to set the highwater mark above 50%.
Can you reproduce the problem while the vm_memory_high_watermark is set
to 0.4 ?

</I>
rabbitmqctl or rabbit_status are invaluable for debugging the kind of
problem you are reporting. Continuous use incurs a small performance
penalty and can prevent quiescent resources from hibernating.

</I>
The data structures have changed from 1.8.1 to 2.0.0, but I don't think
that is the cause of the problem.

&gt;<i> Does anybody has experiment or knows the impact of the new release on

</I>&gt;<i> I insist in the fact that, in our environment, we can toggle SSL

</I>
I'm surprised that the logfile you posted previously stops after opening
ssl and tcp listeners. I would expect to see evidence of 4000+ clients
connecting.

Are you able to get output from &quot;rabbitmqctl list_connections&quot; before
the broker becomes unresponsive? What is the status of the beam or
beam.smp process at that point - is it still running? How much memory
and CPU is it consuming?
