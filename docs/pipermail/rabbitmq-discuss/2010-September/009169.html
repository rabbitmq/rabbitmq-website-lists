<PRE>Am I correct in that anything connected to the broker needs to
reconnect (via new hostname) after the failover takes place? So the
sequence needs to be something like the following:

Producers, Consumers connected to Broker 1
Failover occurs: Broker 1 goes down, Broker 2 comes up
Producers, Consumers reconnect to Broker 2

In general, it would be nice to have documentation that outlines what
needs to occur in a failover scenario as opposed to outlining steps of
a specific implementation (the Pacemaker guide).

Thanks,
Shane

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd like suggestions on automating failover of brokers and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consumers that are connected to them. The failover doesn't have to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; active/active and may take up to a half hour. Ideally, I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have at least two brokers located on different hosts. The hosts will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have access to the same file system (NFS). The number of messages will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be relatively small (&lt;5K/day) and the number of queues no more than 10
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so one broker running at a time should be sufficient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that while RabbitMQ persistence is intended to work on top of NFS,
</I>&gt;<i> we haven't done performance testing of that configuration. &#160;With the
</I>&gt;<i> message rates you mention, it seems unlikely that you'll run into
</I>&gt;<i> problems in that regards, but it's something to be aware of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've looked at the clustering guide and it's purpose seems to be for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scaling but not failover.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's correct. &#160;What we have traditionally termed clustering is
</I>&gt;<i> intended for scaling, not availability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've also looked at the Pacemaker guide but it seems to be an involved
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and more complicated setup than what I need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What steps are others doing for failover? What are my options beyond
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Pacemaker guide?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The pacemaker guide is intended to be illustrative, as well as giving a
</I>&gt;<i> concrete guide on one way to implement failover with RabbitMQ. &#160;There
</I>&gt;<i> are alternative technologies, both open source and proprietary, that can
</I>&gt;<i> be used instead of pacemaker, drbd, etc. &#160;We'd welcome reports from
</I>&gt;<i> users that have implemented failover using other products.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have configured rabbit to store its data on NFS, then you won't
</I>&gt;<i> need the drbd component. &#160;And if you already have appropriate monitoring
</I>&gt;<i> and alerting arrangements in place, then you might well be able to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve a 30 minute failover time without using pacemaker or some other
</I>&gt;<i> cluster resource manager. &#160;Even a manual failover process might be
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable in such a context.
