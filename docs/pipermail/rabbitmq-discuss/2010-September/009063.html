I'd argue that's probably the case for a linux box, and possibly for a windows box, but I'd bet the vast majority of people running on a mac are likely to be developers writing software to be deployed elsewhere.  For that use case (my own) I much prefer the homebrew experience.  That said, if homebrew installed it under a rabbitmq account and required me to use sudo to do so, I certainly wouldn't mind doing so.

</I>
Given my experiences with both, I'd be willing to bet homebrew would still be much nicer, but I certainly understand why you guys aren't interested in investing the time to get the homebrew install up to the level of the macports install in terms of functionality.  That said, it doesn't preclude you from listing it as an option on the install page, with the caveat that not everything is installed, so that people know it's an available option.
