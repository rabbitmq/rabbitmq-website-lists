I also echo the fact that Man pages are usually the last place I look, reading properly formatted
HTML is a lot easier, I can even read it on my phone on the train if I wish.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, I understand what you're saying. I think it's reasonable to have

</I>&gt;<i> rethemeing or rebranding exercise, do you really want to slog through

</I>&gt;<i> N revisions. Does the paragraph need applying to all N copies of the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation? I know these sound like trivial issues, but whatever
</I>&gt;<i> policy is agreed on should be applied consistently, and when you're in a
</I>&gt;<i> team of just 6 full time developers, these things take a substantial
</I>&gt;<i> toll on man power.
</I>
If you are concerned about the branding or something like that, look into Sphinx or
something equally powerful. It will save time for your developers in the long run.

I am not sure that I want it to go many versions back - usually the last point releases
and whatever is supported in the major distros. For example, a lot of people won't be
installing 2.x just yet, and will be a mix or 1.7 and 1.8

&gt;&gt;<i> Until such time I'll use Homebrew because it takes up less space on my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> harddrive and has fewer &quot;parts&quot; to keep track of.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My only fear with that is that eventually people may get bitten by
</I>&gt;<i> missing features which were disabled simply because it would make
</I>&gt;<i> compilation more tricky. What is it about homebrew that you think will
</I>&gt;<i> prevent it from turning into macports again? Are they actively trying to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid supporting anything other than the simplest configuration of each
</I>&gt;<i> package?
</I>
Maybe it is a lack of understanding, but I have seen MacPorts do some really weird
things to my OS X machines. I am hoping that homebrew will be the apt of OS X
but I doubt it, as it requires a level of knowledge of what is happening further in the 
development of the operating system and lets face it Apple don't care.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can't speak for anyone else, but having every possible option turned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on by default is the reason I don't like macports. The fact that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Homebrew does exactly what you've pointed out is why I like it! :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the users should have the choice. Neither system offers that.
</I>
True.
