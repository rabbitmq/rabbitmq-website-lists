I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on how developers use documentation. I can't speak for others, but I don't use man pages unless I'm forced to. When I'm developing, I have about a dozen tabs open with the various documentation sources I need while I'm developing. I use online documentation *exclusively*. I do have a few things with documentation installed locally. Spring framework and the Java SE API docs being the two I use most frequently. But I usually do that because they're so big.

For everything else, I always, always, always use the resources available online. I do that because I switch back and forth between the official docs and googling for examples. I mix other sources in with official documentation. I can't do that if I'm locked into less on a terminal. 

Sorry to burst your bubble, but I *really* hate man pages. I use them for finding out what options I need to pass to a program because it's been a while since I've used it and I don't quite remember. For that, they're really handy. I don't use them for anything else.

&gt;<i> Some software, in e.g. Ubuntu LTS releases, or Debian
</I>&gt;<i> Stable releases, can be 5 years old and no, I would not expect the
</I>&gt;<i> authors to clutter their websites with historical records of past
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.
</I>
Having old versions of things on their website is an expectation I have. Maybe it's unrealistic. I can see no downside to having old versions of documentation hanging around for users of older versions of the software. If you put the version of your documentation in a position:fixed nav box somewhere on the page, you've addressed the problem of being half-way through a page of docs and forgetting what version you're looking at. 

When you write the documentation, if you cover a new feature introduced in that version, you simply put a &quot;since: 2.1.0&quot; or something. If enough of these are sprinkled throughout, people get used to that easily and understand that this feature was introduced in version 2.1.0. The python docs are great examples of this.

&gt;<i> I would however expect to be able to install the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation, if it isn't already, via the package manager, and know
</I>&gt;<i> that it matches the version of the software I have installed.
</I>
I think that's reasonable, but I go back to agreeing to disagree on what format most developers prefer to use documentation in. Erlang folks I think are a little skewed because of the prominence of Emacs, info docs, and the really old school conventions that are perfectly functional but aren't taking advantage of new possibilities.

&gt;<i> There are other optional dependencies of Erlang, for example X Windows.
</I>
Uggh. X. Don't get me started on that! :)

&gt;<i> I can't see any
</I>&gt;<i> evidence of X Windows at all looking through the homebrew list at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula/.">http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula/.</A>
</I>
Thank heavens! :)

XQuartz is awesome and everything I need in an X distro.

&gt;<i> Again, the
</I>&gt;<i> correct solution is demonstrated by Linux distributions which for
</I>&gt;<i> example have both erlang and erlang-nox packages thus allowing you to
</I>&gt;<i> choose which is installed. Then RabbitMQ can depend on erlang |
</I>&gt;<i> erlang-nox. In fact, in modern linux distributions, Erlang has been
</I>&gt;<i> split up into many smaller packages so that packages really can express
</I>&gt;<i> precisely which parts of Erlang they depend on, which bits are
</I>&gt;<i> optional, and which bits have no bearing at all on the package.
</I>
I do like this because it really burns me that I have to install X on server machines that will never have an X session run on them because it's a dependency.

&gt;<i> Over the last 20 years, Linux distributions have honed package managers.
</I>&gt;<i> It's no surprise that these days rpm and deb systems are comparable in
</I>&gt;<i> power in terms of package management and are extremely capable. _I_ am
</I>&gt;<i> frequently amazed at how incapable package management is on other
</I>&gt;<i> platforms.
</I>
I wish there were aptitude for Mac. If someone wants to really make Mac developers happy, they'd port apt to OS X and have a little GUI to download binaries, like you suggest.

Until such time I'll use Homebrew because it takes up less space on my harddrive and has fewer &quot;parts&quot; to keep track of.

&gt;<i> IMHO, most of the pain caused by macports is only addressed by
</I>&gt;<i> homebrew's packages _seeming_ to do the absolute minimum required to
</I>&gt;<i> make something compile at the cost of excluding (almost?) all optional
</I>&gt;<i> features and components.
</I>

I can't speak for anyone else, but having every possible option turned on by default is the reason I don't like macports. The fact that Homebrew does exactly what you've pointed out is why I like it! :)

Thanks!
