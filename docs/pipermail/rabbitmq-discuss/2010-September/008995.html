<PRE>I have to echo Matthew's sentiments on MacPorts. I've had pretty good luck with it once I got it tweaked the way I wanted. Also, I only use it to install Erlang when it comes to Rabbit. Rabbit itself I install just by unpacking the generic UNIX tarball into /opt. Fast and simple. Also, by symlinking /opt/rabbitmq-server to /opt/rabbitmq_server-xxxx I can keep multiple versions around for testing. 

I wouldn't be against supporting homebrew but I wouldn't abandon MacPorts to do it. 

Regarding the documentation, I usually find what I need but I'd agree it's not as neatly organized as MongoDB. I do like the design of RabbitMQ.com.

</I>&gt;<i> I certainly want to scream &quot;are you freaking kidding me!?!?&quot; too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not many people use Gentoo these days - many of us will remember leaving
</I>&gt;<i> our PIIs on over night with them compiling away at KDE or some similar
</I>&gt;<i> monster and waking up in the morning to find it's still going. That was
</I>&gt;<i> at least 10 years ago. There is absolutely _no_ _way_ I would tolerate a
</I>&gt;<i> system where I had to compile every piece of software I needed. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> understand why macports or homebrew users do. Having googled around,
</I>&gt;<i> macports does seem to support binary packages, but does no one use them?
</I>&gt;<i> I run Debian unstable (Sid) on my desktops and laptops, and I apt-get
</I>&gt;<i> dist-upgrade most days. That normally results in probably 200MB of
</I>&gt;<i> binary package downloads every day in total for maybe 40 updated
</I>&gt;<i> packages. Compiling that number of packages every day is clearly
</I>&gt;<i> ridiculous.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that macports actually gets dependencies much more
</I>&gt;<i> accurate to support the _whole_ package than homebrew. For example, yes,
</I>&gt;<i> Erlang, in its entirety requires lots of extra stuff to, e.g. build the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation. It appears that if you're installing Erlang under
</I>&gt;<i> homebrew you're just not going to get that documentation. The same
</I>&gt;<i> applies for RabbitMQ itself (there's even a comment in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/rabbitmq.rb">http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/rabbitmq.rb</A>
</I>&gt;<i> saying that they disable documentation because it has additional compile
</I>&gt;<i> time dependencies). Again, distributing binary packages here is the
</I>&gt;<i> correct solution: _only_ the package maintainer need have everything
</I>&gt;<i> installed to build the documentation, and for the end users, they get it
</I>&gt;<i> all, and they don't have to do anything at their end. Runtime
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies are frequently a fraction of compile time dependencies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _I_ am distinctly unhappy about the fact that if homebrew continues to
</I>&gt;<i> become more popular, more and more RabbitMQ users are going to be
</I>&gt;<i> installing it without the documentation. We put time and effort into the
</I>&gt;<i> man pages, and I will _always_ refer to locally installed documentation
</I>&gt;<i> in preference to websites: you should always be able to trust that the
</I>&gt;<i> locally installed documentation matches the version of the software you
</I>&gt;<i> have installed. Some software, in e.g. Ubuntu LTS releases, or Debian
</I>&gt;<i> Stable releases, can be 5 years old and no, I would not expect the
</I>&gt;<i> authors to clutter their websites with historical records of past
</I>&gt;<i> documentation. I would however expect to be able to install the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation, if it isn't already, via the package manager, and know
</I>&gt;<i> that it matches the version of the software I have installed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are other optional dependencies of Erlang, for example X Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> This is optional but having it means that you can use some tools (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> appmon) that you otherwise wouldn't be able to use. Macports seems to
</I>&gt;<i> assume that you're always going to have X Windows installed somehow,
</I>&gt;<i> given how prominantly it's mentioned in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.html.">http://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.html.</A> I can't see any
</I>&gt;<i> evidence of X Windows at all looking through the homebrew list at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula/.">http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula/.</A> Again, the
</I>&gt;<i> correct solution is demonstrated by Linux distributions which for
</I>&gt;<i> example have both erlang and erlang-nox packages thus allowing you to
</I>&gt;<i> choose which is installed. Then RabbitMQ can depend on erlang |
</I>&gt;<i> erlang-nox. In fact, in modern linux distributions, Erlang has been
</I>&gt;<i> split up into many smaller packages so that packages really can express
</I>&gt;<i> precisely which parts of Erlang they depend on, which bits are
</I>&gt;<i> optional, and which bits have no bearing at all on the package.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Over the last 20 years, Linux distributions have honed package managers.
</I>&gt;<i> It's no surprise that these days rpm and deb systems are comparable in
</I>&gt;<i> power in terms of package management and are extremely capable. _I_ am
</I>&gt;<i> frequently amazed at how incapable package management is on other
</I>&gt;<i> platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO, most of the pain caused by macports is only addressed by
</I>&gt;<i> homebrew's packages _seeming_ to do the absolute minimum required to
</I>&gt;<i> make something compile at the cost of excluding (almost?) all optional
</I>&gt;<i> features and components.
