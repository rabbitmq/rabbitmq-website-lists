Ubuntu is an excellent example. They have quite a rigid release regime, 
so it can take a while for an upstream package to make it into a 
release. Ubuntu users are used to that. The question is, what do 
homebrew users expect?

We do have contacts at Canonical who we liaise with regarding the 
rabbitmq packaging. Quite a few issues with rabbit and its packaging 
have been resolved that way.  We'd like that situation to be the same 
for homebrew one day. Let's see what we can do in the meantime ...

&gt;<i> I don't know why there's pushback on this.  Everybody who responded to 
</I>&gt;<i> this thread who uses Mac was +1 for simply including Homebrew in your 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.
</I>
My underlying motivation for enquiring about the maintainer status of 
the rabbitmq homebrew formula is so that I can phrase the addition to 
our documentation appropriately.

I've taken a first stab at mentioning homebrew in 
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/server.html.">http://www.rabbitmq.com/server.html.</A>

I'd also like to add something to <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html</A> 
at some point but that involves first figuring out what the equivalent 
of <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html#macports">http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html#macports</A> looks like for 
homebrew, which I am not in a position to ascertain atm.


Regards,

Matthias.
