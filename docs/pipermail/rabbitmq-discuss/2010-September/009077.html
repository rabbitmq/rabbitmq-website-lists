<PRE>+1 on Mac users deploying to other OSes.

It's sometimes a pain to run rabbitmq on a Mac as a service. It's convenient and all, but if I need to restart the server a lot, I'll just run the rabbitmq-server command (without sudo ;) in a terminal. I don't like to have stuff running when I'm not using it, so I don't always rely on background services. I also like seeing any stdout output without having to tail a log file.

IMHO I wouldn't plant a flag on Mac users needing a dedicated user for the broker and I'd also make it simple to optionally install the launchd service. I might not want to run it as a background service.

For that use case (my own) I much prefer the homebrew experience.  That said, if homebrew installed it under a rabbitmq account and required me to use sudo to do so, I certainly wouldn't mind doing so.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Given my experiences with both, I'd be willing to bet homebrew would still be much nicer, but I certainly understand why you guys aren't interested in investing the time to get the homebrew install up to the level of the macports install in terms of functionality.  That said, it doesn't preclude you from listing it as an option on the install page, with the caveat that not everything is installed, so that people know it's an available option.
