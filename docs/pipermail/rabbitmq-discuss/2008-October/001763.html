Well, no, actually, that's not true. That's only true of a naive
implementation of a binding-based system. The RabbitMQ-based
implementation where you're modelling all the primitive AMQP concepts
as direct Erlang processes would definitely suffer from this problem,
but I'm sure you could work out a system where invoking a binding
dynamically modifies the routing table of the exchange.

&gt;<i> This is true, but I think until AMQP goes 1.0, you should, IMHO,
</I>&gt;<i> prioritize design over backwards compatibility.
</I>
Agreed completely.

&gt;<i> I think it may not necessary be a good idea to de-characterize an
</I>&gt;<i> exchange to the extent that it merely represents a logical address. If
</I>&gt;<i> you were to do so, you would be automatically precluding semantics
</I>&gt;<i> that you could efficiency build into a custom exchange (e.g. an
</I>&gt;<i> exchange that delivers to a subset of the matching binding - for
</I>&gt;<i> example the shortest queue).
</I>
Well, you're talking about a custom routing rule, and conflating that
with an exchange. Custom routing rules are great, and orthogonal to
Exchanges if you decouple exchanges from routing, which is what I'd
really prefer.

&gt;<i> Furthermore, you can bring the consumer driven-ness into the realm of
</I>&gt;<i> your app by having a convention that prevents a producer from
</I>&gt;<i> declaring exchanges - if the exchange doesn't exist, then the producer
</I>&gt;<i> will not be able to send messages to it.
</I>
Then the &quot;createExchange&quot; call shouldn't be an assertion, it should
check for a pre-defined configuration point.

Remember, I'm concerned with badly written applications, where they
might even tell you in documentation all the exchanges that they're
using, but they're actually lying. This happens a lot sadly.
