<PRE>Ben, Thanks.

Coincidentally, I did look into rabbit_exchange:route while waiting for your
response. One (very very minor) thing that struck me on reading it was the
use of regexp:split/2 to convert &quot;a.dotted.topic.key&quot; to
[&quot;a&quot;,&quot;dotted&quot;,&quot;topic&quot;,&quot;key&quot;]. I wondered why the more efficient
string:tokens/2 was not used. They do have different behavior in edge
conditions (e.g. &quot;.atopic&quot;) - was that the reason?

Anyway, besides that, for now I'll probably just go with a topic exchange,
which seems to be the general purpose ancestor of all the others. I really
do not want to add my code to the Rabbit server side and risk having merge
difficulties when future releases arise...

Regards,
Edwin

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry if this is answered elsewhere (I did look), but how (in a nutshell)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The abridged version:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you look into at functions rabbit_exchange:route/2 and
</I>&gt;<i> lookup_qpids:/1 in the same module on the 18776 branch, you might be
</I>&gt;<i> able to follow how the generalized routing mechanism works. Basically
</I>&gt;<i> you read the routing table for bindings to queue names that match your
</I>&gt;<i> key, resolve their corresponding process ids and the rest is handled
</I>&gt;<i> for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The realistic version:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Somehow you're going to have to make a routing decision, and this
</I>&gt;<i> usually has something to do with bindings, although you could
</I>&gt;<i> theoretically create some kind of foo exchange that just picks some
</I>&gt;<i> queue names out of a hat. But if you need to do stateful routing,
</I>&gt;<i> you're going to have to retrieve the state from somewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might also want to make sure that you are not breaking any other
</I>&gt;<i> functionality that you currently rely on when you do this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This also wouldn't necessarily been spec compliant per se, although
</I>&gt;<i> section 3.1.3.6 of the 0-9 spec mentions the possibility of custom
</I>&gt;<i> exchanges. So you would have to be comfortable with that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, unless it was a really worthwhile addition, we probably wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> maintain it in the main Rabbit tree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other than that, feel free to do so. We have talked about plugable
</I>&gt;<i> queues before (although Matthias has rightly pointed out that this is
</I>&gt;<i> much easier said than done) so why should exchanges be any different?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But despite all of these practical considerations, there is a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> merit to adding custom exchanges (which Kirk may interpret as custom
</I>&gt;<i> routing algorithms :-), because the exchange is point in the AMQP
</I>&gt;<i> pipeline with the greatest amount of leverage effect when it comes
</I>&gt;<i> down to deciding which messages go where.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HTH,
