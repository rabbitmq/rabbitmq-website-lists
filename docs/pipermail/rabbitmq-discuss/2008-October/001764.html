<PRE>Also, John O'Hara piped up on the Blog post where I told everybody who
reads said drivel-filled-narcissistic-writing
(<A HREF="http://kirkwylie.blogspot.com/2008/10/amqp-exchanges-and-routing-thread-on.html">http://kirkwylie.blogspot.com/2008/10/amqp-exchanges-and-routing-thread-on.html</A>)
that apparently this has all been resolved in the 1.0 draft, which I'm
QUITE eager to see.

Hopefully that will resolve this!

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Personally, I believe that the spec should be changed so that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> exchanges are nothing other than producer-provided namespaces/groups
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of related messages, and consumers should bind to exchanges based on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the semantics that they want.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think you may find resonance with some members of the WG on this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue. However, moving the routing algorithm to the binding does have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a practical implication from an implementation perspective. This would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turn any routing decision into a linear scan of all of the bindings in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> order to perform a match on the routing type :-( You would not be able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to exploit any type-based indexes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, no, actually, that's not true. That's only true of a naive
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of a binding-based system. The RabbitMQ-based
</I>&gt;<i> implementation where you're modelling all the primitive AMQP concepts
</I>&gt;<i> as direct Erlang processes would definitely suffer from this problem,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'm sure you could work out a system where invoking a binding
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically modifies the routing table of the exchange.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is true, but I think until AMQP goes 1.0, you should, IMHO,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prioritize design over backwards compatibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed completely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think it may not necessary be a good idea to de-characterize an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchange to the extent that it merely represents a logical address. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you were to do so, you would be automatically precluding semantics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that you could efficiency build into a custom exchange (e.g. an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchange that delivers to a subset of the matching binding - for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example the shortest queue).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, you're talking about a custom routing rule, and conflating that
</I>&gt;<i> with an exchange. Custom routing rules are great, and orthogonal to
</I>&gt;<i> Exchanges if you decouple exchanges from routing, which is what I'd
</I>&gt;<i> really prefer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, you can bring the consumer driven-ness into the realm of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your app by having a convention that prevents a producer from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> declaring exchanges - if the exchange doesn't exist, then the producer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will not be able to send messages to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then the &quot;createExchange&quot; call shouldn't be an assertion, it should
</I>&gt;<i> check for a pre-defined configuration point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Remember, I'm concerned with badly written applications, where they
</I>&gt;<i> might even tell you in documentation all the exchanges that they're
</I>&gt;<i> using, but they're actually lying. This happens a lot sadly.
