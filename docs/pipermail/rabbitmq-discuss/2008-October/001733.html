That patch addresses the issue of the connection to the other peer's
socket being lost.

I don't quite know what you mean with the failure of a tx_select
command. How does this differ from anything any other pending RPC
whose bottom half doesn't arrive because the underlying socket
connection has died?

</I>
Sorry, I don't follow this either - are you saying that the socket
abstraction in Erlang should try to reconnect a few times before
telling higher level code that the underlying TCP connection has died?

&gt;<i> Basically when it restarts it tries to connect to the remote rabbitmq
</I>&gt;<i> instance and of course,
</I>&gt;<i> since it's down (in my test), it raises an econnrefused because no port is
</I>&gt;<i> open. This is
</I>&gt;<i> all good and fine. I suspect that since econnrefused is an exception I
</I>&gt;<i> should plug my
</I>&gt;<i> logic right there and catch it and start a loop there that runs until the
</I>&gt;<i> connection is
</I>&gt;<i> established and use an exponential backoff to ask for new connections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think this makes sense?
</I>
If I you are meaning to say that retries are a concern of the client
app rather than the client itself, then yes.

&gt;<i>From an architectural perspective, the role of the client is to
</I>provide a transparent and correct propagation of events between a
client app and the broker. It should not try to address the problems
of application flow that are best left to higher level code.

HTH,

Ben
