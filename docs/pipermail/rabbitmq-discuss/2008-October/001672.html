The real problem that you have here is that the Basic.Reject command
as specified in the AMQP protocol is not implemented in RabbitMQ :-(

There is a compatibility matrix here: <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/compatibility.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/compatibility.html</A>

The reason was because the reject behaviour specified in 0-8 of the
spec was a bit tricky. Also we have only been asked by one other
person to implement this functionality, hence it has been
de-prioritized.

However, it is a roadmap item, because we want to be fully spec
compliant after 0.91 is signed off.

I can't give you an ETA on this feature, it will get done when time
and resources permit.

In the meantime, the example I posted previously is just a workaround
for the lack of Basic.Reject.

&gt;<i> In my current implementation I am closing the channel occasionally, for no
</I>&gt;<i> particular reason, but to get the redeliveries. This causes the processing
</I>&gt;<i> to temporarily stop or slow down since I have to wait for all tasks to be
</I>&gt;<i> done and acked before I can close the channel. (Since messages need to be
</I>&gt;<i> acked on the same channel they were received on, as far as I know.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would probably be possible to have two parallel channels open, one active
</I>&gt;<i> (receiving new tasks) and one waiting for its tasks to be done and acked,
</I>&gt;<i> then closing the inactive one, making the previously active one passive and
</I>&gt;<i> opening a new active channel. This would add the complexity of keeping track
</I>&gt;<i> of what message that should be acked on what channel.
</I>
Yes, it's clunky. A good solution would be to convince us to implement
this feature :-)

&gt;<i> Are there any good patterns to handle this?
</I>
Maybe you can describe the specific use case that requires you to have
redeliveries before we talk about strategies to deal with them.

Ben
