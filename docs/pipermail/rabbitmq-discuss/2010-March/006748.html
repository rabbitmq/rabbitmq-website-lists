<PRE>I did have some race conditions in the first pass of the code, but I
think that's fixed before I wrote to the list.  Generating the 'ping'
happens as part of a $queue-&gt;do_when_created() callback.  I'm
certainly not explicitly changing the ack settings or QoS settings.

I actually fixed my example by not binding the reply queue to
amq.direct, and instead using the default binding to the unnamed
default exchange.  Which is good in that I can move forward on other
parts of my project, but one of the secondary goals of the project is
to learn about how AMQP works in implementation, and I still don't
understand what was wrong with the first approach.

I never delete queues - I let the server do that when the connection drops.

I suppose there could be another race between the bind to amq.direct
and the pong.  I wasn't explicitly waiting for bindOK, although as I
recall from the traces, I was getting bindOK, before sending the ping,
and it still wasn't working - but I'll check that.

Are there rules about what can be bound to amq.direct?

It would be useful if there were some way to have rabbitmq output
every transaction (in commit order?) for analysis/debugging. Is there
any mechanism to do something like that?  Maybe as a plugin?
