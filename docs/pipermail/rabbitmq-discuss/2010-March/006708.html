No, but...

&gt;<i> Is there a better way to make sure the results from an RPC to A are

</I>
Yes. You can either *sign* messages from A (and this doesn't have to be
an expensive operation) such that D can verify the authenticity of the
reply, or you can simulate object capabilities:

  - let D declare a private reply queue with a long, unguessable
    name only known to D.

  - let D pass this name to A in the RPC request.

  - let A use the name to send the reply back to D.

If D is careful not to let anyone else know about the secret queue name
(a UUID will do), then it can be sure that messages arriving on the
queue come from A or from parties that A has transitively trusted with
the secret.

&gt;<i> I think it would not scale well (in the thousands) if A, B, C each had
</I>&gt;<i> permissions to write to one queue exchanges E2, E3, and E4, but maybe
</I>&gt;<i> that's wrong too.
</I>
Thousands of different RabbitMQ user IDs should work just fine. Might be
awkward to manage, but should work just fine. (You might look in to BQL
for a rapidly evolving utility for managing large amounts of rabbity
configuration.)
