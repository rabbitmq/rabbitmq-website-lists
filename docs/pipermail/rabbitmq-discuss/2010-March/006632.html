Sorry but I don't understand why we have 4kHz in total.

All 8 consumers are listening the same queue. The hardware of Rabbit

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any message, now if instead of restart this consumers I stop the other
</I>&gt;<i> four
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consumers in the other machine he come back to receive messages...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anybody here have any feelings about what is happen ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's very interesting. You don't say which client you're using though.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, when this happens, what does Rabbit record in the logs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm using Rabbit client in Java to consume and .Net Rabbit client to produce
the messages.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My Rabbit server have 20Gb of memory and 4 processors P6 and when this
</I>&gt;<i> drop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happen Rabbit are consuming 80% of Proc and 20% of Memory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have never used Power6 machines, and I have no idea how well Erlang
</I>&gt;<i> (or Rabbit) runs on it, I'm afraid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is the point, I think that we will be the first in this environment, I
tried to found some experiences in Internet but don't found nothing. I'm
using Erlang R12 yes I know it's very old, but RH have only this version
compiled for ppc, I'm trying to install R13B but having some compiling
problems with ncourses, but It's other e-mail :).

We will do more some tests enabling more 2 processors, and will run
Erlang/Rabbit over 6 processors p6 4.2Ghz for long stress times.We have
severals concerns to be the first to use this environments.


&gt;<i> &gt; My message size is about 180~200Kbytes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those are pretty big. If my maths above is right, that means that you're
</I>&gt;<i> trying to push (4+32)*1000*200*1024 = 7372,800,000 bytes / sec, which is
</I>&gt;<i> 6.8GB/s or 55Gb/s. That's enourmous. I suspect maybe my maths is wrong
</I>&gt;<i> and you actually have all 8 consumers bound to the same 1 queue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sorry, I put wrong values, my fault, My message size have 180 Bytes ~
1Kbytes. And all in the same queue. Another information Rabbit always crash
with queue size get Rabbit's memory limit I try to found but don't see a way
to configure queue to drop messages after a specific size or memory limit.
It's other problem.
