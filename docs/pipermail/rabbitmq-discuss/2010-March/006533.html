<PRE>Thanks for all of the help.  I got it working!

I had no luck with calling basicCancel() and then waiting for the handleCancelOK() method to be called.  I realized after stepping through the source with a debugger that a Channel disassociates the Consumer when basicCancel() is called:

ChannelN.java: line 645:

                Consumer callback = _consumers.remove(consumerTag);

The only way that I knew I could reestablish this association was by calling Channel.basicConsume().  Unfortunately this didn't work.  Messages after that point were never delivered.  

I finally used the close and re-open the Channel approach.  This worked as expected.

If anyone would like to see my solution code, let me know.

Thanks.

-John
