This was my initial approach. Unfortunately it requires the mentioned
&quot;extra logic&quot;, which must be implemented for all types of objects you
want to serialize.

If there was some kind of ID on each message then the ID could be
saved in the DB on the same transaction as the message's object. Then
duplicates could be filtered on a per-message basis, as opposed to per
object. However, I'm not aware of any kind of a message ID in rabbit
that could be used. Can you think of anything?



&gt;<i> Also note that delivery messages have a redelivered flag. If this is 0
</I>&gt;<i> (or false), Rabbit is guaranteeing to you that the message has not
</I>&gt;<i> previously been delivered (hence you can skip duplicate tests here). If
</I>&gt;<i> it's 1, then Rabbit is saying it *may* have been already delivered to
</I>&gt;<i> you before, so you should check to see whether you've already received
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I wasn't aware of this. Thank you.

Tomek
