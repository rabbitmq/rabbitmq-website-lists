<PRE>Hi,

I have a big doubt about one specific test.

I'm running my RabbitMQ in one server, and have 2 producers in other server
posting ~2000 messages /s , and have 4 consumers in one server and other 4
in other.

When I start the test all running fine.. but my 8 consumers not consuming
the queue in same speed that we are posting, ok it is the proposal of test,
all 8 consumers are working harder consuming ~1200 /s when my doubt happen,
all the time that I run this test it happen, when my queue have a size about
200.000 messages all consumers at one of this two consume's machine stop to
receive messages, all of them, and if I restart all consumers in this
machine anyone get any messages from Rabbit,all are connected but don't get
any message, now if instead of restart this consumers I stop the other four
consumers in the other machine he come back to receive messages...

Anybody here have any feelings about what is happen ?

My Rabbit server have 20Gb of memory and 4 processors P6 and when this drop
happen Rabbit are consuming 80% of Proc and 20% of Memory.

This Queue are transient.

My message size is about 180~200Kbytes

Any help will be appreciated.

Regards.
