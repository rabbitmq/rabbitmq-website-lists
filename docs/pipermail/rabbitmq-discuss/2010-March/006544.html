<PRE>Hi Garrett,

This is really interesting topic. We thought about this a bit way back
when Rabbit was new. Things have moved on a bit since then, so perhaps
the time is right for taking another look.

Initially, we only had Erlang (and Java) libraries for speaking AMQP.
Since then, I've hacked together rabbitmq-c, which makes implementing an
Erlang distribution protocol perhaps possible, as the Erlang VM needs
its distribution protocols to be implemented in C, IIUC.

Yes, this makes sense. Some abstraction over the details of the network,
in a similar vein to the way SQL databases permit abstraction over the
file system.

&gt;<i> * Marshalling Erlang terms
</I>
term_to_binary/1 and binary_to_term/1 do nicely here :-)

&gt;<i> * Global process registry (e.g. sync'd fanout)
</I>
Hmm. State sync is tricky, but could be done, perhaps by addition of a
new stateful-exchange plugin? Like a &quot;hashtable&quot; exchange type.
(Actually maybe MikeB's LVC plugin could step in here?
<A HREF="http://github.com/squaremo/rabbitmq-lvc-plugin">http://github.com/squaremo/rabbitmq-lvc-plugin</A>)

Alternatively, standard election techniques for use with multicast media
could be implemented. Ick.

&gt;<i> * remote_process() ! term()
</I>
This is where the C-level VM hackery would come in.

&gt;<i> * rpc:xxx
</I>
I *think* this is mostly done at the Erlang level.

&gt;<i> The point of this would be to make transitioning to rabbitmq from a
</I>&gt;<i> standard Erlang mesh as seamless as possible. E.g. gen_server:call/2
</I>&gt;<i> would just work without much/any work for the developer.
</I>
It's a lovely idea.

Regards,
  Tony
