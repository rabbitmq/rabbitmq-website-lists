Does this sound like a likely cause?  I've identified and removed the code that was creating all the channels, but I'm concerned that it appears to be so easy for a single rogue client to take down the entire server.  Is there a way for me to prevent this?

Good to know.  We'll be controlling all the producers and consumers, so it isn't a huge worry that it would be possible to DOS, we'll just have to be a little more careful on our end.  Thanks for confirming the likely cause of the crash - I now feel comfortable that it was a self-inflicted wound and don't have to worry that we have a problem with our rabbitmq install.
