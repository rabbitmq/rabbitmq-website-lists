Okay, I think I have a bead on what you've got going.

For AMQP's role, I'd approach this as an internal-only problem, which
will simplify your thinking. I'd keep everything external facing
strictly HTTP based.

You can opt to introduce the broker early in the process, but you
don't *need* to. I'd recommend starting with a relational database
(avoiding the temptation to go with some &quot;nosql&quot; thing) for your
persistence layer. This is super simple and, from what I'm
understanding, will work just fine to start. Once you have the rest of
your system working, you can introduce a messaging tier to address
specific pain points.

System architectures evolve so don't think you need to build
everything up front.

On the other hand, it sounds like you've got an itch to explore this
stuff. If your project can tolerate some speculative R&amp;D work, go for
it! As far as selecting an AMQP platform, I think you're looking at
the right one.

Garrett
