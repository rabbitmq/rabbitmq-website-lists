<PRE>Matthew,



&gt;<i> What you can do, is publish messages in parallel, using different
</I>&gt;<i> channels. The server can coalesce these commits under some 
</I>
There is a requirement in our application that messages have to be published/received in order,
so we have to use single channel.

&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to me the bottleneck was 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not fsync, because disk was not busy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also i tried commenting out 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file:sync() from the src code and it has no effect.
</I>
&gt;<i> That is very curious. Also, don't do that - if it crashes at that point
</I>&gt;<i> you're not going to be able to recover much data from disk ;) How big
</I>&gt;<i> are the messages you're writing?
</I>
I disabled file:sync() just to test if the bottleneck is caused by fsync.
The result showed it was not.  In your previous email you mentioned using ext3 with data=ordered you could get close to 500 msg/sec.  that means it is affected by disk.  However, i still think 20/sec is slow.

thanks!

-alex
