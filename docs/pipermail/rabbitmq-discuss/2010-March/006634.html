2kHz * 2. Maybe you were giving cumulative rates and you meant 2kHz
inbound in total?

&gt;<i> All 8 consumers are listening the same queue.
</I>
Ahhh! So each consumer will receive 1/8th of the messages. Thus if we
have 2kHz inbound, we will now have 2kHz outbound.

&gt;<i> &gt; Also, when this happens, what does Rabbit record in the logs?

?

You should be able to compile erlang without requiring ncurses, but
you'd at least have to provided a number of extra flags to configure.

&gt;<i> Sorry, I put wrong values, my fault, My message size have 180 Bytes ~
</I>&gt;<i> 1Kbytes.
</I>
Right, so we've gone from world-beating network performance to about
2MB/s. :D

&gt;<i> And all in the same queue. Another information Rabbit always crash

</I>
What is the crash message, what are the entries in Rabbit's logs?
