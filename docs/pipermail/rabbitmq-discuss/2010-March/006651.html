Err, this suggests there is only one producer. The channel here is a
single channel within a connection. One way to get what you want is to
use the shovel. Apologies for the ASCII art:

                            Node A
Producers &gt;--\ 
              &gt;-&gt; exchangeA ---&gt; queueA ---&gt; shovelA -\
(various) &gt;--/                                        |
                                                      |
             /----------&lt;--------------&lt;--------------/
             |
             |                /--&gt; queueB --&gt; shovelB ---&gt; [to node B]
             \--&gt; exchangeB -&lt;
                              \--&gt; queueC --&gt; shovelC ---&gt; [to node C]

The reason why this works is because there is only one thing (shovelA)
that publishes to exchangeB. As such, you can guarantee that the
messages will be in queues B and C in the same order, and then picked up
by shovels B and C and routed onto nodes B and C. However, many
different producers can send messages into exchange A, and they can (and
will be) processed in an ordering that only preserves ordering within a
channel.

I hope that helps.

Matthew
