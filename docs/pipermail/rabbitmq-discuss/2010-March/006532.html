Publishing is asynchronous. Hence a publisher has no idea when a 
particular message has been accepted by the server and safely written to 
disk for recovery in the event of a restart, *except* by using 
transaction. So if you don't use transactions, you'd still have to keep 
copies of messages ...but you won't know how many and for how long.

</I>
We have spent a good few person weeks discussing various options along
those lines. Here are a few points to note:

1) introducing any synchrony into the message flow carries significant
performance penalties.

2) there is no way for a server to stop accepting publishes without also
stopping to accept anything else, notably acks, since any AMQP
connection can carry a mixture of commands.

3) AMQP 0-8/9/9-1 are in desperate need of an inexpensive mechanism that
allows clients to find out when publishes have been accepted. We have a
few design ideas here and may extend the protocol to implement them. Not 
any time soon though.

&gt;<i> This will simplify client's publish a lot - no need to use commit
</I>
I don't see commits as overly burdensome. After all, what you are
suggesting above is in effect a synchronous publish, in which case just
introduce a helper method that does a publish followed by a commit.

&gt;<i> no need to listen for channel flow.
</I>
There are good reasons for the existence of something like channel.flow. 
It allows clients to continue performing operations other than publish, 
notably ack'ing of messages.


Regards,

Matthias.
