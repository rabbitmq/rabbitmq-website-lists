<PRE>Hi Emilie,

thanks a lot for your comments.

One thing you pointed out called my attention:

&quot;I would expect it to be more convenient for you to have an AMQP client in
each JVM and therefore use a connection per JVM. AMQP connections are cheap
resources and you need not try to conserve them. Brokers with tens of
thousands of connections are not unheard of.&quot;

This is the way I started implementing, and in each JVM I can have multiple
consumers and producer, so I was thinking about have 1 connection per JVM
with one channel per producer/consumer. I like the idea of separate
producers and consumers.

As the project goes, I will update the list with question/comments.

Best Regards,

</I>&gt;<i> Your project sounds interesting. If I understand your question correctly

</I>&gt;<i> connections.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I need to architect a Java application using rabbitmq as its message

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the role of connect the JVMs. Basically, each JVM has sets of objects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (currently they are grouped by host:port) that can change messages to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other objects in other groups in other virtual machines (there is a 1:1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bi-directional relationship between groups of objects in different JVMs).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The idea of use the broker is to avoid the number of tcp ports I have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> open and also to take advantage of the message delivery guaranties.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The design is simple: each group of objects will have an exchange and 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> queues (incoming and outcoming) to change messages.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would like to know if you guys advise the following configuration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regarding rabbitmq:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1- Have 1 connection per JVM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2- Have multiple channels to that connection. Each channel will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> associated with those 2 queues
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What is concerning me is: the number of sends/receives per channel is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> high (about 5k/second). Should I have multiple connections (like a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pool), or it is ok to use just 1 connection? If I have a pool of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connections, I understand they will share the same tcp port, and I could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not see any difference in using a single Connection.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The broker port will be same for each of multiple connections, but the peer
</I>&gt;<i> port will typically be random. The difference is that connections with a
</I>&gt;<i> single channel can fail and block without affecting other connections.
</I>&gt;<i>
