<PRE>Hi Jerry,

thanks fo the links, especially the <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html</A>
 one.

this is what I pre supposed and wondered about with my &quot;-ish&quot; comments:


&gt;<i> &quot;The binding is semantically identical to exchange-to-queue bindings:
</I>&gt;<i> unidirectional, binding keys and exchange types operate as normal, but both
</I>&gt;<i> endpoints (the source and destination) of the binding are exchanges.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
 This little phrase from you is an important one for me:


&gt;<i> &quot;(In case you've already thought to worry, cycle eliminations and message
</I>&gt;<i> de-duplications are taken care of by the broker, for both exchange and queue
</I>&gt;<i> bindings, so you don't have to worry about a topological misstep creating
</I>&gt;<i> perpetual messaging machines, ending up with unexpected duplicate
</I>&gt;<i> deliveries, etc.)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
thanks,
-Steven

&gt;<i> Hi, Steven:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The doc for the Java client's method is here:

</I>&gt;<i> The ideas behind it are captured here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 'exchange.bind' method is used to bind one exchange to another
</I>&gt;<i> exchange, with behavior akin to how an exchange-queue binding works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using this you can create more elaborate or hierarchical routing topologies
</I>&gt;<i> within your broker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've also implemented but not yet released &quot;internal exchanges,&quot; as per
</I>&gt;<i> the AMQP spec, which are exchanges that can only be used &quot;on the inside&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> these exchange-to-exchange scenarios (i.e. an external client can't publish
</I>&gt;<i> to them).  Thus, internal exchanges can of codify and protect their role as
</I>&gt;<i> internal routing plumbing and not let clients leak messages into your
</I>&gt;<i> routing setup in unexpected ways.  Internal exchanges ought to debut in a
</I>&gt;<i> relatively soon to come release, but I don't know precisely when.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thanks for the reply.  That's good news on the multiple bindings.  The

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know that client very well myself, but poking around in its source

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I had found the api guide, and faq.  I haven't explored the java library
</I>&gt;<i> yet. I looked at  + played with the .net examples: declareQueue, perf test,
</I>&gt;<i> subscriber, etc.  I also looked at a bunch of the presentations such as the
</I>&gt;<i> one that Alexis did at Google. BTW: the getting started guide with the
</I>&gt;<i> python/java examples is quite good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe more of those are going to be forthcoming, so, as they say,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I'm at the stage where I need to solve specific problems / issues +
</I>&gt;<i> choose an optimum exchange / routing setups. I'm sure you've been there
</I>&gt;<i> yourself i.e. high level pretty good. Low level -- like that example was
</I>&gt;<i> easy, I can see how that worked, but still stumbling around a little bit in
</I>&gt;<i> the code for my stuff type of thing. Getting there. If you guys can help me
</I>&gt;<i> put my hands on some of these specifics I'd appreciate that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Absolutely.  We're happy to help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Filling in the gap between the high level structure and the details of the
</I>&gt;<i> implementation with best practices and the locally tasteful idioms takes a
</I>&gt;<i> bit of time, but, in general Rabbit, its code, and its documentation reward
</I>&gt;<i> study.  The team and community are generally active and interested in
</I>&gt;<i> helping out newcomers to the community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also there's an upcoming book on Rabbit that you might find useful:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.manning.com/videla/">http://www.manning.com/videla/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first couple of chapters are available from the publisher in an
</I>&gt;<i> early-access/preview edition.  It looks like it will fill an important niche
</I>&gt;<i> in the Rabbit ecosystem as it comes together.
