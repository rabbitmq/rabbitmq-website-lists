</I>&gt;<i> sounds like you're not so concerned about LDAP itself, as in having a

</I>
Yes the previous statement is true, what I really need ldap/auth backend is for user auth. 
It seems the current state of the plugin would suffice my needs.

Matt

I'd describe it as more than experimental :) It's there as much as 
anything to test a plugin mechanism for authentication / authorisation - 
and that mechanism is itself experimental at the moment :)

Hopefully at some point in the future this will all get merged and then 
the LDAP plugin will be a binary download like the others.

That's quite true, slapd is pretty horrible to get started with.

&gt;<i> If interested you might want to try compiling the auth-ldap plugin

I think we talked about this before. I'm interested to note that it 
sounds like you're not so concerned about LDAP itself, as in having a 
way to manage large numbers of users / vhosts. Is that fair?

At the moment our plans for authentication / authorisation plugins 
involve virtual hosts still residing inside RabbitMQ - only users and 
permissions would be external. Would that work for your use case?

Cheers, Simon
