<PRE>I confess that I am not a Flex sophisticate and have not worked with AMQP from it, but does the rough pattern of the following seem suitable for you:

<A HREF="http://hopper.squarespace.com/blog/2008/1/26/flex-amqp-client-technology-preview.html">http://hopper.squarespace.com/blog/2008/1/26/flex-amqp-client-technology-preview.html</A>

i.e. the Flex client publishes to an exchange that routes to a queue that the .NET server application consumes from; the .NET server app then does its work and publishes its result to an exchange that routes to a queue that the Flex client consumes from?

Hi,

I am new to RabbitMQ and I have just downloaded it.

I have a Flex/AIR application that have C# services and I would like to use RabbitMQ to allow services and Flex client to communicate.  Flex calls its services in an async manner. I intend to use as3-amqp to talk to RabbitMQ.

The basic workflow would be, I suppose:

-          Flex adds a message to a queue that has an id of the service and its parameters;
-          A .NET server would pick the message, execute the service and return the response to Flex;

I have already developed a small client/server example but the caller is synchronous, in Flex all must happen in a async way.

I have read some articles and .NET documentation.  I would like to ask you what could be the best practices to work with RabbitMQ in an environment like that.

Thanks in advance
