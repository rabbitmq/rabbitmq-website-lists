Hi Thadeu,

Your project sounds interesting. If I understand your question correctly 
you want to know if you should be using one connection with many 
channels, or many connections each with a single channel.

A possibly relevant consideration is that if the broker needs to apply 
backpressure because of an overactive producer then all the channels 
sharing a connection with that producer will be blocked. Channels that 
can't tolerate this risk should have a connection to themselves. For the 
same reason you may want to separate producers and consumers to use 
different connections.

I would expect it to be more convenient for you to have an AMQP client 
in each JVM and therefore use a connection per JVM. AMQP connections are 
cheap resources and you need not try to conserve them. Brokers with tens 
of thousands of connections are not unheard of.

The broker port will be same for each of multiple connections, but the 
peer port will typically be random. The difference is that connections 
with a single channel can fail and block without affecting other 
connections.
