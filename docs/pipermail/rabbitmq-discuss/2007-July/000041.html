<PRE>I have an Ubuntu Dapper 6.06 server. I tried adding the RabbitMQ APT
repository and using it, but it doesn't like the erlang versions
availabe. Is there any chance of getting packages for Ubuntu 6.06
available via a repo or should I just install manually?

Thanks!
Wes

Here is some output from apt-get:

server:~ sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.

Since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that
the package is simply not installable and a bug report against
that package should be filed.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  rabbitmq-server: Depends: erlang-nox but it is not going to be installed
E: Broken packages
