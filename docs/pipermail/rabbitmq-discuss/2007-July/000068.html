<PRE>Matthias,


&gt;<i> I think that may partially be due to some design choices in the
</I>&gt;<i> channel/queue implementation that may need revisiting. atm the
</I>&gt;<i> consume_ok is sent by the *queue* process. I think it ought to be sent
</I>&gt;<i> by the channel process instead - the channel process should be
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for sending back responses to *all* synchronous methods.
</I>
Fair enough, but I can't see how this affects the direct client
fundamentally or even in terms of what messages it passes and what it
expects to receive. I think that this could potentially be done
independently of the direct client.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why do the channel processes need to be named?
</I>
They don't need to be named per se. I just chose that approach as way
to get a handle or a reference to a process that is implementing
channel N. GIven the fact that you want to have a separate process per
channel, if you stored the pid of the channel handler, that would
suffice as well. I just though this is a simple way of maintaining a
reference to the process that has done the protocol handling for a
particular channel. Otherwise you would have to devise another way to
refer to the protocol state of a channel.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if you use the named approach, the API might look this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access_request(Channel, Host, Realm)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to see
</I>&gt;<i>   access_request(Channel, Realm)
</I>
I orginally started with that variant, then I thought it might be
ambiguous when you are connecting to more than one AMQP server. In the
direct case, adding the host is probably unecessary, but I wanted to
keep a consistent interface for the network case.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; You appear to be changing the channel's writer pid with every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; basic_consume. That doesn't look right.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you mean in the mainloop_without_framing function?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>
The current code is catering for the basic_consume call, so it sets
the writer pid to the actual subscriber and the ack_pid to process
handling the protocol for a channel:

mainloop_without_framing(State) -&gt;
    receive
	{method, MethodRecord, Content} -&gt;
	    State1 = handle_method(MethodRecord, Content, State),
	    mainloop_without_framing(State1);
	{method, MethodRecord, Content, SubscriberPid} -&gt;
        WriterPid = State#ch.writer_pid,
        State0 = State#ch{writer_pid = SubscriberPid},
	    State1 = handle_method(MethodRecord, Content, State0),
        State2 = State1#ch{writer_pid = WriterPid},
	    mainloop_without_framing(State2);
	Other -&gt;
	    rabbit_log:error(&quot;Unexpected ch~p content: ~p~n&quot;,
[State#ch.channel, Other]),
	    mainloop_without_framing(State)
    end.

&gt;<i> &gt; So are you saying that you should pass in the consumer's pid to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rabbit_amqqueue_process and have that maintain a list of consumers?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> rabbit_amqqueue_process already does this.
</I>
I've been looking at this, but viewed it as an optimization rather
than a fundamental change. At the moment the queue sends to the writer
that then sends to the actual consumer, when is an extra hop in the
chain. I think this could be changed without having to change the
client interaction.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't see how the networked API will change anything on the server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side, otherwise wouldn't you have to change the java client as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea was/is to use the existing server code (rabbit_reader,
</I>&gt;<i> rabbit_channel etc) as the basis for the client code. This will require
</I>&gt;<i> some refactoring along the lines you have been pursuing so that server
</I>&gt;<i> and client can share a substantial part of their code base.
</I>
I suppose you could use the handle_XXX functions in rabbit_channel
directly to acheive the same goal. In that case, you might have to
merge some of the channel0 stuff into this channel. I can see some
merit in that, though I think this would have to get discussed a bit
more before diving into any code.

BTW, I've implemented the process per channel model and now I'm
looking at paramterizing the ampq_client to cater for the network
case. Will let you know when something useful comes to life.
