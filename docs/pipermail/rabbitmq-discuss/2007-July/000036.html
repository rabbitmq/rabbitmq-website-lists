<PRE>Ben

It does help thanks.

A reduced instruction set is seen as essential by the AMQP Working
Group, because not everyone needs to use more than a few base cases.
Watch this space over the next few months for some ideas on that.

ReplyTo is where things are heading as a core enabler for RPC.  I was
in fact curious as to whether you might be trying to replicate some of
what goes on with JMS, since that is a requirement driving some of the
RPC and addressing work in AMQP - we want to get interop right
obviously.
