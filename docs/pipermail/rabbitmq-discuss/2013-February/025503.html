Connections, and, to a (much) lesser degree channels, are comparatively 
expensive, to create. And latency matters, even for local connections.

Anyway, I suggest you start by figuring out how to re-use the 
connection. As you say. That should make a massive difference and might 
be all you need to do in order to get sufficient performance for your 
use case.

</I>
That is actually quite reasonable. It's not the most efficient - as 
Simon says, queue creation is expensive - but fits your business domain 
well, so I'd stick with that design until other avenues for increasing 
performance have been exhausted.

Regards,

Matthias.
