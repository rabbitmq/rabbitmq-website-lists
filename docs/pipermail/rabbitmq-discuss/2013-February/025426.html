<PRE>Matthias,
        Adding more people to the discussion.

- Where exactly does the client hang? Does it get stuck in a rabbitmq client API call? If so, which one?
I will get you a stack trace as soon as I can capture a failed case.

-It is possible that the TCP connections have been disrupted.
Could be we are living in the virtual world, so I am not sure what the connectivity does? (Jerry/Anthony - can you answer?)

Are AMQP heartbeats enabled on the connections? If not then please do that. Or upgrade the server 3.0.x which enables heartbeats automatically.
No, we are upgrading to 3.0.2 to hopefully get us this.

Thanks
Peter Konar

IIRC this is normal tcp behaviour. I'm pretty sure the O/S will release the port eventually. Could take a while though, possibly hours.

It is possible that the TCP connections have been disrupted.

Are AMQP heartbeats enabled on the connections? If not then please do that. Or upgrade the server 3.0.x which enables heartbeats automatically.

Heartbeats ensure that disrupted tcp connections get detected promptly.
They also help keeping connections alive in the presence of firewalls which may close them when idle for a while (thus being one source of disrupted connections).

&gt;<i> Server side [<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">pkonar at ajtrafp017</A> ~]$ sudo rabbitmqctl list_connections
</I>&gt;<i> name last_blocked_age last_blocked_by Listing connections ...

</I>&gt;<i> [etc]
</I>
That all looks perfectly normal.

Matthias.
