No, I wouldn't expect it to work at all.

</I>
Indeed. The hostname can be changed, but it has to be resolved for the broker to run.

&gt;<i> The reason, I have to do all this is because I need to package everything
</I>&gt;<i> before shipping to customer environment.  The hostname/FQDN specified can't
</I>&gt;<i> be validated in my environment but I still need to make sure everything is
</I>&gt;<i> setup correctly.

This all depends on what you mean by 'setup' - are you wanting to configure queues,
exchanges and bindings on you machine and make these available at the install-site
later on? If so, you could export these definitions from your machine and make
them available at startup (or just once using the admin cli) using the RabbitMQ
management plugin: see <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html</A> for details.

&gt;<i>  The customer is just going to put it in their environment
</I>&gt;<i> and everything should work fine.  I would appreciate some guidance from you.
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Why can't you package the .rpm along with the pre-requisites and deal with
this by having a sequence of actions that run at the install site:

1. unpack the rpm and install it directly
2. unpack the configuration settings/changes and apply them

Or something like that?

Of course, you can override the various locations of things using the advice
specified in <A HREF="http://rabbitmq.com/relocate.html.">http://rabbitmq.com/relocate.html.</A> You're not going to get far with
an unresolved hostname.
