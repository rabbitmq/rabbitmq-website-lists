<PRE>RabbitMQ team-

Could you please share some insight on when are we expecting Rabbit to 
become JMS compatible? We have now implemented RabbitMQ in a clustered mode 
(along with HAProxy in the front) and all initial tests seem to be very 
satisfactory. In the next few weeks and months, I need to be able to use 
this setup as my full blown middleware - including JMS compatibility. I 
understand this feature is in works - please let me know when can I start 
testing it and when would it be production ready. 

Thanks,
Sandy

</I>&gt;<i> 3. Both of these brokers need to be working in high-availability (HA in

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that the new vendor app that we are trying to plug in here

</I>&gt;<i> JBoss MQ or otherwise buy IBM MQ (which could always be done technically 
</I>&gt;<i> but it's cost prohibitive for us for now).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to figure out if I can use RabbitMQ as a JMS provider? If I can

</I>&gt;<i> provider. Please share if someone has run into something similar.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thx in advance...
