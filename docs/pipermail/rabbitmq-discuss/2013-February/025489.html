<PRE>We are looking at the best way to use only one connection and have only the
channel created each time.  Bear in mind that its all happening on the same
physical server and the servers that I refer to are actually software
services as opposed to different physical machines.  So network latency
shouldnt be a big problem here.

It is possible I need to rethink my strategy a little.

The application is for trading.

S1 receives a signal to open a trade and sends the order to S2 which is
responsible for sending the trade to the brokers.  When S1 receives a
signal to open the trade it creates an object to manage all the
communication back and forth between the broker.  So it creates a queue
that will route all incoming messages to do with that specific trade back
to the object.  For this reason the object (which is a new object for each
trade) will create a new channel, queue and binding, specifically for the
life of the trade.

Thanks for the suggestions, I may need to think about this process and
decide which is the best way to use RMQ.
