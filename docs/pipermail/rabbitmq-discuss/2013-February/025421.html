That depends. If the broker were not anywhere near 100% CPU then yes 
(maybe - it depends what the slowest link in the chain is). If it were 
close to maxed out then the additional work done could push it over the 
edge.

&gt;<i> One of the use cases that we're look at is being able to make an RPC

Shovel would definitely require that you take quite a static approach to 
routing for this stuff.

&gt;<i> As for having a mode where federation optimized speed over reliability,
</I>&gt;<i> that might be interesting to us.
</I>
Cool. Well it turned out to be very easy to implement, so that will be 
available in RabbitMQ 3.1.

Cheers, Simon
