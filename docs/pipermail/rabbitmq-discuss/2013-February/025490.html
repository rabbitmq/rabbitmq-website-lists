<PRE>I am implementing an abstraction over dynamic pub/sub.  The idea is that
you have named &quot;themes&quot;, and within those themes you have &quot;subjects&quot; that
can be used as a filter.  Themes may or may not be transient.

I think have two choices:

1) Each named &quot;theme&quot; is a separate topic exchange and &quot;subjects&quot; map
directly to routing keys *(i.e., &quot;stocks&quot; topic exchange, with messages
having routing keys like &quot;nasdaq.apple.price&quot;)*.

2) There is a single topic exchange and the routing key is a composite of
theme and subject *(i.e., &quot;themes&quot; topic exchange, with messages having
routing keys like &quot;theme.stocks.subject.nasdaq.apple.price&quot;)*.

Although #1 has a better one-to-one mapping to my problem, I am inclined to
go with #2 because it is much easier to manage (a single exchange that
never gets deleted, vs many exchanges that I must manage the lifecycle of).

The only thing I am unsure of is if there is any difference in performance?
 Multiple exchanges are more expensive in memory, but will a single
exchange need more CPU to route messages because it is dealing with so many
more disparate bindings?

Thanks for any guidance.
