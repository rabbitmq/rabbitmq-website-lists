Throttling is behaviourally equivalent to network congestion. The 
messages are buffered in the network, until those buffers fill up, at 
which point the sender will block.

If, for example, connections were blocked due to lack of disk space and 
the server suddenly regained some disk space then all the messages 
published by clienta while connections were blocked will flow into the 
server and be processed.

So presumably you are not *just* concerned about connection blocking due 
to disk space.

The general mechanism for dealing with potential message loss on 
publishing is 'confirms'. Now, while connections are blocked, no 
confirms for messages buffered in the network will be sent to clients. 
But, as noted above, the messages aren't actually lost. Potential loss 
will only occur when the connection gets terminated. At which point the 
safe assumption on the publisher side is that any messages which hasn't 
been confirmed may have been lost.
