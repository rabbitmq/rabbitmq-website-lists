<PRE>Simon,

Thank you so much for your detailed response - it was very helpful to me
and answered all of my questions.

Regards,

Richard

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In this situation there would be topic exchange named &quot;B1.TE&quot; &quot;B2.TE&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> B1.TE would have B2.TE configured as an upstream exchange and B2.TE

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Broker B1 would have queues &quot;B1.Q1&quot; and &quot;B1.Q2&quot; configured and bound to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchange B1.TE with routing keys &quot;B1.Q1&quot; and &quot;*.Q2&quot; respectively.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Broker B2 would have queues &quot;B2.Q1&quot; and &quot;B2.Q2&quot; configured and bound to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchange B2.TE with routing keys &quot;B2.Q1&quot; and &quot;*.Q2&quot; respectively.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is valid, certainly. Note that the exchanges and queues in B1 and B2 do
</I>&gt;<i> not need to have distinct names (but maybe you were just doing that to be
</I>&gt;<i> clearer?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2) Assuming the answer to question #1 above is &quot;yes, it is valid&quot;, would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone confirm my understanding of how the following messages would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> routed?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A message sent to exchange B1.TE with routing key &quot;B2.Q1&quot; would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> received, forwarded to exchange B2.TE, placed in queue B2.Q1,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  and then acknowledgement would be sent back to the client.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming the client is publishing in confirm mode, the confirm will be
</I>&gt;<i> sent back as soon as B1 has taken responsibility for the message. Confirms
</I>&gt;<i> mean &quot;the broker you published to took responsibility for the message&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise as your federation grows larger and less-reliable network links
</I>&gt;<i> come into play, you could be waiting a long time for those confirms!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  A message sent to exchange B1.TE with routing key &quot;B1.Q2&quot; would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> received, a copy placed in queue B1.Q2, a copy forwarded to exchange
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> B2.TE, placed in queue B2.Q2, and then acknowledgement would be sent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back to the client.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A message sent to exchange B2.TE with routing key &quot;B2.Q2&quot; would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> received, a copy placed in queue B2.Q2, a copy forwarded to exchange
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> B1.TE, placed in queue B1.Q2, and then acknowledgement would be sent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back to the client.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, yes to the routing, no to when confirmation happens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  3) My understanding is that an exchange has knowledge of the routing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> topology of any upstream queues and therefore won't send a message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upstream that wouldn't end up in a queue. Firstly, is that understanding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correct?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you mean &quot;downstream&quot; in both cases, but yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Secondly (if yes to the previous question), what type of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overhead are we talking about when using this configuration with a topic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchange?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Effectively the bindings propagate upstream, so each federated exchange
</I>&gt;<i> will end up with all the bindings for all of its downstreams.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  My worry is that the processing power required to deliver each message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will increase exponentially as I add additional brokers in a &quot;mesh&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> style federated topology as it seems that the routing table on each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upstream exchange has to be examined for each message delivery.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it won't be exponential. But the routing table will get larger.
</I>&gt;<i> Topic routing is approximately O(log n) in the number of bindings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The federation mechanism doesn't try to trade routing complexity for
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessarily-routed messages by amalgamating topic keys since
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  (a) it would have to know about topics for that, it's supposed to be a
</I>&gt;<i>      generic mechanism
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  (b) it can't know what the distribution of messages across your
</I>&gt;<i>      routing key space is
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, *you* know that distribution. So you could federate topic
</I>&gt;<i> exchanges and then use e2e bindings from them to local topic exchanges,
</I>&gt;<i> with relatively &quot;large&quot; routing keys that will cover a decent sized range.
</I>&gt;<i> Then apps bind queues to the local topics. That does require a bit more
</I>&gt;<i> up-front setup though - but it kind of has to since it requires knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> of how your routing keys are distributed.
