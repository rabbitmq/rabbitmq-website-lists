Yup. The times are about right. See the connections from 182. The first email show port 49191 which was opened at 15:17 GMT. It was hung for quite a while before we got to it but the server closed it at 21:22 and opened a new one. That's around the time we were in there.

If it matters the log is attached.

The latter is the most obvious explanation, yes.

If you haven't nuked the server logs, the lifecycle of the
10.196.42.182:49191 connection should still be visible in rabbit.log;
just search the log for that ip &amp; port. Would be good to get hold of the
log entries pertaining to that connection since I am curious what
(rabbit thought) happened to it.

Matthias.
