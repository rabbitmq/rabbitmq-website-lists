Matthias,
   We have automated the recovery of logs for this issue to speed analysis. I have attached two logs that show issues with in the first 5 minutes of it happening.
In &quot;report.pt.13:35&quot; we show that 10.196.42.180 in not outputting as scheduled. These logs include jstacks of the processes on the 5 machines outputting as well as rabbit reports and netstats.


report.pt.13:40&#8206; (516 KB&#8206;) shows that there are two machines

Thanks
Peter Konar

Here's the relevant portion:

&lt;quote&gt;
=INFO REPORT==== 13-Feb-2013::15:17:00 === accepting AMQP connection &lt;0.2252.1282&gt; (10.196.42.182:49191 -&gt;
10.196.42.21:5672)

=ERROR REPORT==== 13-Feb-2013::21:22:01 === closing AMQP connection &lt;0.2252.1282&gt; (10.196.42.182:49191 -&gt;
10.196.42.21:5672):
{heartbeat_timeout,running}
&lt;/quote&gt;

So the connection was open for quite a while and then got closed due to a missed heartbeat.

The default heartbeat interval is 10 minutes, but the server will only time out between two and three intervals after the last data has been received, so it could take up to half an hour for the server to kill a connection that has gone bad.

The question is why the server isn't seeing any data. There are two obvious explanations:
a) there is a network disruption, and
b) the server has stopped reading from the socket

The presence of a non-empty Recv-Q on the server-side connection points to the latter. We need to get hold of a 'rabbitmqctl report' showing that connection while the Recv-Q is non-empty, so we know what state the server thought the connection was in at the time.

Regards,

Matthias.
