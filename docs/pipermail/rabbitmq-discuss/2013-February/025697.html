It is valid, certainly. Note that the exchanges and queues in B1 and B2 
do not need to have distinct names (but maybe you were just doing that 
to be clearer?)

&gt;<i> 2) Assuming the answer to question #1 above is &quot;yes, it is valid&quot;, would
</I>&gt;<i> someone confirm my understanding of how the following messages would be
</I>&gt;<i> routed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A message sent to exchange B1.TE with routing key &quot;B2.Q1&quot; would be
</I>&gt;<i> received, forwarded to exchange B2.TE, placed in queue B2.Q1,
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> and then acknowledgement would be sent back to the client.
</I>
No.

Assuming the client is publishing in confirm mode, the confirm will be 
sent back as soon as B1 has taken responsibility for the message. 
Confirms mean &quot;the broker you published to took responsibility for the 
message&quot;. Otherwise as your federation grows larger and less-reliable 
network links come into play, you could be waiting a long time for those 
confirms!

&gt;<i> A message sent to exchange B1.TE with routing key &quot;B1.Q2&quot; would be
</I>&gt;<i> received, a copy placed in queue B1.Q2, a copy forwarded to exchange
</I>&gt;<i> B2.TE, placed in queue B2.Q2, and then acknowledgement would be sent
</I>&gt;<i> back to the client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A message sent to exchange B2.TE with routing key &quot;B2.Q2&quot; would be
</I>&gt;<i> received, a copy placed in queue B2.Q2, a copy forwarded to exchange
</I>&gt;<i> B1.TE, placed in queue B1.Q2, and then acknowledgement would be sent
</I>&gt;<i> back to the client.
</I>
Again, yes to the routing, no to when confirmation happens.

&gt;<i> 3) My understanding is that an exchange has knowledge of the routing
</I>&gt;<i> topology of any upstream queues and therefore won't send a message
</I>&gt;<i> upstream that wouldn't end up in a queue. Firstly, is that understanding
</I>&gt;<i> correct?
</I>
I think you mean &quot;downstream&quot; in both cases, but yes.

&gt;<i> Secondly (if yes to the previous question), what type of
</I>&gt;<i> overhead are we talking about when using this configuration with a topic
</I>&gt;<i> exchange?
</I>
Effectively the bindings propagate upstream, so each federated exchange 
will end up with all the bindings for all of its downstreams.

&gt;<i> My worry is that the processing power required to deliver each message
</I>&gt;<i> will increase exponentially as I add additional brokers in a &quot;mesh&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> style federated topology as it seems that the routing table on each
</I>&gt;<i> upstream exchange has to be examined for each message delivery.
</I>
Well, it won't be exponential. But the routing table will get larger. 
Topic routing is approximately O(log n) in the number of bindings.

The federation mechanism doesn't try to trade routing complexity for 
unnecessarily-routed messages by amalgamating topic keys since

  (a) it would have to know about topics for that, it's supposed to be a
      generic mechanism

  (b) it can't know what the distribution of messages across your
      routing key space is

However, *you* know that distribution. So you could federate topic 
exchanges and then use e2e bindings from them to local topic exchanges, 
with relatively &quot;large&quot; routing keys that will cover a decent sized 
range. Then apps bind queues to the local topics. That does require a 
bit more up-front setup though - but it kind of has to since it requires 
knowledge of how your routing keys are distributed.

Cheers, Simon
