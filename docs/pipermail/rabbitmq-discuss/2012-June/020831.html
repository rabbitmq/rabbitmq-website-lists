<PRE>Some background, currently I am using rabbitMQ as a broker in direct
mode between applications.

There is X number of applications running at 1 time all binding to the
same exchange and send out messages with a routing key.

e.g App A will publish message with key &quot;111&quot; and App B, C, D will
receive the messages A sent. Similarly B, also publish with &quot;111&quot; and
A ,C,D will receive the message etc.

However I noticed a problem with my design as App A will also receive
back the message it sent as it consume with the same key. Is there a
way to configure such that messages sent out does not route back to
the same application? Thanks

Regards,
Tang
