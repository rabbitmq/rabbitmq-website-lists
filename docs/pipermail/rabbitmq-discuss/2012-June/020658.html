Ok well it 'looks' as though your Make tool isn't playing nice with some 
file system path or other. The bit of the error message that states 'The 
system cannot find the path specified.' seems to indicate that the path 
handling in the makefile isn't happy, and I don't find this at all 
surprising. GNUWin32 is not a supported build system, AFAIK.

Try running 'VERBOSE=1 make' (or 'make VERBOSE=1') to see a bit more 
output, as it'd be helpful to understand *what* path isn't being picked up.

You could also try installing a Cygwin based tool chain instead, as the 
makefiles *may* rely on tools that aren't present in GNUWin32, including 
Python and possibly some other bits. See 
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/build-server.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/build-server.html</A> for a list of things you'll 
also definitely need on your system to build from source, including 
openssl.

So you're going to implement a custom security provider? Are you aware 
that a badly behaving plugin can crash the entire runtime system? See 
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html</A> for more details.

What kind of security mechanism are you hoping to provide? Is it 
authentication or authorisation that you're implementing, or both?
