<PRE>I see that I misunderstood the federated exchange type - you declare
the backing type when you declare the exchange.  For some reason I
thought the backing type was based on the upstream exchanges.

It's still a little odd to me that the master is responsible for
&quot;pulling&quot; rather than having the upstream brokers push.  If I add new
upstream brokers, do I have to edit the master's configuration and
restart it to consume messages from them?

</I>&gt;<i> I understand that the sources and destination fields accept a list for the

</I>&gt;<i> master cluster, but I'm worried about the shovel's host broker failing and
</I>&gt;<i> taking the shovel down.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FYI: The 'sources' and 'destinations' configuration fields both accept a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list. The shovel plugin doesn't actually pull/push to/from all of these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simultaneously, it uses them as a form of simple failover - if a connection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fails, it uses the next one in the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It sounds like for your scenario (when clustering in general), it would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easier to use the federation plugin (
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/federation.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/federation.html</A>). When you declare a federated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exchange on the downstream/master cluster, the plugin auto-magically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; declares queues (mirrored if configured) on the upstream/AWS cluster .. you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would then bind a mirrored queue to the federated exchange on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; downstream/master cluster to cause messages to be routed across the link to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that queue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The plugin will then stay connected even if one of your nodes on either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cluster go down .. if the whole downstream/master cluster goes away/down,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then messages will pile up in the upstream/AWS queues, and be transfered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; once the link is re-established.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does that solve your use-case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Brendan
