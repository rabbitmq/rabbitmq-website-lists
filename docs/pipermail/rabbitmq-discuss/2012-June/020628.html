When rabbit-server (or rabbit-server.bat) fails to start, you get a non-zero exit status, so you *should* be able to deal with that in your program by trying again or whatever.

&gt;<i> From the log file, it\' looks like (i\'m not in fron of that mechine right

</I>&gt;<i> This problem will also kill my producer script ... since it\'ll fail to

</I>&gt;<i> Kindly please give me your enlightment to solve this problem.

Which problem are you asking for help with bino - what to do about restarting rabbit, handling rabbit up/down statuses in the producer script, or dealing with an intermittent 3g connection? If it's the latter, then I'd recommend wrapping your rabbit startup routine with a check to ensure that the 3g connection is up. You'll also need to do something in your producer script to handle rabbit being potentially unavailable sometimes. If the internet connection is intermittent, then you're not going to escape from having to handle this scenario.
