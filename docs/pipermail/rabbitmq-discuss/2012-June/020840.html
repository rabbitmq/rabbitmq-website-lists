<PRE>Tang,

You could add a header property to the message with App A&#8217;s signature (different from other apps) then read this back when the message is received and ignore if found.

Dan.

Subject: Re: [rabbitmq-discuss] Exchange design to use such that messages sent does not route back?

Hi,

  It is what I am looking for as I have only one routing channel and I want everyone to talks in the same channel and except I don't want to hear what I say.

Regards,
Tang

Seems you are looking for a &quot;not&quot; semantics in routing key?
That's probably something AMQP could not provide now. Or?
I would love to see if there is a nice work around though.

Some background, currently I am using rabbitMQ as a broker in direct
mode between applications.

There is X number of applications running at 1 time all binding to the
same exchange and send out messages with a routing key.

e.g App A will publish message with key &quot;111&quot; and App B, C, D will
receive the messages A sent. Similarly B, also publish with &quot;111&quot; and
A ,C,D will receive the message etc.

However I noticed a problem with my design as App A will also receive
back the message it sent as it consume with the same key. Is there a
way to configure such that messages sent out does not route back to
the same application? Thanks

Regards,
Tang
