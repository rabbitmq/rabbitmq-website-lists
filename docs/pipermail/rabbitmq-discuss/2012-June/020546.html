<PRE>This really does sound like a firewall issue to me - remember that there 
may be other firewalls than the ones installed on the machines A and B.

On computer A, what does &quot;telnet &lt;computer B&gt; 5672&quot; look like?

Cheers, Simon

</I>&gt;<i> * I don't think it's a problem with the RabbitMQ server on computer B

</I>&gt;<i> * I checked the RabbitMQ log files on computer B after trying scenario #3,
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't see anything that says something about an attempted connection.
</I>&gt;<i> I think computer A is simply unable to see computer B when sending requests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My question, very generally is, what are some things that I should be

</I>&gt;<i> is checked on computer A but is not checked on computer B. Computer B has
</I>&gt;<i> the default installation of Erlang and RabbitMQ. I'm pretty sure computer A
</I>&gt;<i> is also set to the defaults (I didn't install it as recently).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please help.
