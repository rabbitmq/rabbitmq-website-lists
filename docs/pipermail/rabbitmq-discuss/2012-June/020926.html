<PRE>I thought I sent along another message, but apparently it didn't go
through.  Viewing this group through the new Google Groups UI is
confusing.

I misunderstood the federation configuration; I see now that you
declare a backing type when you declare the federated exchange, which
makes sense.  I thought the backing type was based on the upstream
exchange.

Going back to shovel for a second... if I have two shovels running in
a cluster, one on each broker, and they connect to their host broker
and consume from the same mirrored queue (the queue is 'shared' across
the cluster) will they simply behave like two consumers on the same
queue, and basically receive messages round-robin?  Because that would
work fine for my scenario.  They'll share the workload unless one of
the brokers in the cluster dies, after which one shovel would be doing
all the work.

</I>&gt;<i> The odd thing about the federation plugin is that the downstream broker,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Eric,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FYI: The 'sources' and 'destinations' configuration fields both accept a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list. The shovel plugin doesn't actually pull/push to/from all of these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simultaneously, it uses them as a form of simple failover - if a connection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fails, it uses the next one in the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It sounds like for your scenario (when clustering in general), it would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easier to use the federation plugin (
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/federation.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/federation.html</A>). When you declare a federated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exchange on the downstream/master cluster, the plugin auto-magically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; declares queues (mirrored if configured) on the upstream/AWS cluster .. you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would then bind a mirrored queue to the federated exchange on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; downstream/master cluster to cause messages to be routed across the link to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that queue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The plugin will then stay connected even if one of your nodes on either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cluster go down .. if the whole downstream/master cluster goes away/down,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then messages will pile up in the upstream/AWS queues, and be transfered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; once the link is re-established.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does that solve your use-case?
</I>&gt;<i>
