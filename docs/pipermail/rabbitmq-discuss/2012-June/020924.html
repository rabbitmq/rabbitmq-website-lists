<PRE>+1. Your contributions will be missed!

On Fri, Jun 22, 2012 at 7:41 AM, Matthew Sackman &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">matthew at rabbitmq.com</A>&gt;wrote:

&gt;<i> As some of you will have noticed, over the last few months, my
</I>&gt;<i> contributions to RabbitMQ have decreased fairly sharply. I have been
</I>&gt;<i> busying myself with other projects (eg AtomizeJS) and have only really
</I>&gt;<i> returned to work on Rabbit to help with knowledge transfer
</I>&gt;<i> (active/active HA systems) and other issues that interest me (eg the
</I>&gt;<i> Codel AQM experiments). Even that though is now at an end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whilst I am staying with VMware, I'm now officially moving on from
</I>&gt;<i> working with RabbitMQ to pastures new.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I first started work on RabbitMQ in the summer of 2006 and whilst there
</I>&gt;<i> were about 2.5 years in which I did various bits of a PhD and didn't
</I>&gt;<i> have anything to do with Rabbit during that time, I've nevertheless been
</I>&gt;<i> involved in Rabbit on and off for the last 6 years. When I returned to
</I>&gt;<i> LShift early spring 2009, Rabbit was a very much more primitive beast
</I>&gt;<i> than it is today - it couldn't hold more messages than could fit in RAM,
</I>&gt;<i> there were no plugins, we didn't implement the whole of AMQP 0-8, let
</I>&gt;<i> alone 0-9-1, there was no form of HA at all, etc etc. I am very grateful
</I>&gt;<i> to have had the opportunity to work on many of those areas and help the
</I>&gt;<i> community and guide the direction of Rabbit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, Rabbit is in very good hands going forwards, not just with
</I>&gt;<i> the remaining members of the original team that came, along with myself,
</I>&gt;<i> to VMware from LShift, but with additional recruits, and of course with
</I>&gt;<i> the community that has, through bug reports, the creation of many
</I>&gt;<i> clients and applications, and through publicity in the form of blog
</I>&gt;<i> posts, books, and tweets, helped so much with Rabbit's growth and
</I>&gt;<i> continuing popularity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you, one and all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Matthew
