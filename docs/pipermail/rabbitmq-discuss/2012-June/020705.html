The trouble is that AMQP doesn't give us the ability to warn-on-publish 
(and even if it did it's easy to imagine that the typical default client 
callback would be a no-op). So it's not clear where a warning would go - 
we already write to logs and show a big red thing in mgmt, but from the 
number of questions we're getting asked it's clear people are not seeing 
these.

However, there's no denying that this has hurt a lot more people than we 
expected, and we really don't like that.

So for the next release we're intending to go with a lower disk space 
limit - probably a hard 1GB. This is not ideal - ideally we would always 
have the ability to page the whole of memory out to disk - but it's at 
least somewhat likely to stop you before you *actually* run out of disk 
space and crash, while hopefully not causing the wave of false-positives 
that have inconvenienced people running 2.8.2.

Cheers, Simon
