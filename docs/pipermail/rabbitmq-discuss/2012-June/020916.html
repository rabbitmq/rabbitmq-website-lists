&gt;<i> I have a server script running three threads. One main thread with the inner core of the server instance, and then one receiver thread, and one sender thread. The receiver thread has one asynchronous pika connection receiving messages, and the sender thread has another asynchronous pika connection sending messages. This server instance is running just fine, but here and there this error pops up, and after the error comes write buffer exceeded warnings. At this point I simply restart the server script and everything is fine again.

</I>&gt;<i> How can I track this issue down? It's not easy to replicate, usually it happens every second day or so. I guess the question is actually two fold. First, looking in the base_connection.py file on line 106, it seems that the error variable passed to the _handle_error is None which makes it problematic to get the error_code. At this point in the code it seems odd for error to be None, but on line 137 error has a default value of None. So the first thing is to try to figure out whether the error is a proper error, or if it's just a bug somewhere in the event handling. Second, if it turns out to be a proper error, how can I debug to see which message / event triggered the error? Is there any way that I can see inspect the traffic to try to find the bad message / event?

Looks like a bug in pika to me, maybe you should open up an issue
at <A HREF="https://github.com/pika/pika/issues">https://github.com/pika/pika/issues</A>

This looks hard to track down indeed, but in general you should probably expect
that such errors can happen, and retry the operation if it does.

pika should raise some connection related error if there is no error code,
so that you can depend on catching some other exception than TypeError.
