If certain types of messages have to be processed by particular  
consumers, this could be achieved by having consumers bind to  
different queues, I think. It also sounds like a use case for using  
predicates in header based routing, which unfortunately is not  
currently implemented in rabbit.

Point 3 sounds like asynchronous RPC, for which there is already a  
pattern.

Points 1 and 2 sound like they are required to support point 3, but  
I'm still failing to see the concrete business requirement for that,  
but having said that, I don't understand your domain.

</I>
Thats why I was asking whether you can turn the decision on it's head  
by just having the producers fire and forget and letting the consumers  
dequeue messages based on some predicate.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is definitely conversational state between producers and

</I>&gt;<i> state.  You could even look at our consumers as state machines that

</I>
Fair enough. If you do need to maintain a conversation between a  
producer and consumer over multiple message exchanges then I can see  
why things might have to be determined by the producer.
