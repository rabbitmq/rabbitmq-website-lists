<PRE>Hi Mike,

I can't give you exact timelines other than to say this is what I'm 
working on now, but I'm also working on STOMP too :)

I see your point about reason strings in the nack, but I'm doubtful this 
is something we would add. It feels like a leakage of DLE into the protocol.

With DLE as it stands, you *can* tell that a message was dead-lettered 
because it was nacked, or because its queue was deleted and so on.

</I>&gt;<i> Your Dead Letter Exchange sounds very interesting, just what I need in fact for option 2 :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How long before we can expect to see this in RabbitMQ? I'm thinking I'll probably have to implement a client-side DLE for the time being and then change to use your DLE once it's available. But it's great to hear that it's happening.

</I>&gt;<i> Mike,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The solution you outline in option 2 sounds like the Dead-Letter Exchange support I'm working on at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using DLEs, you can declare that a queue routes all dead messages to a specified exchange for later processing. Messages are considered dead when:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The queue containing the message is deleted
</I>&gt;<i> * The queue containing the message is purged
</I>&gt;<i> * The queue containing is deleted due to lease expiry
</I>&gt;<i> * The message is rejected (basic.reject or basic.nack) with requeue=false
</I>&gt;<i> * The TTL for the message expires
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Messages are routed to DLEs using their original routing key. If you make the DLE a fanout exchange then you can easily route all dead messages to all queues bound to the DLE.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When this feature is complete, the DLE code will ensure that persistent messages are routed through the DLE before being removed from the source queue - this should give you the guarantee of safety that you are looking for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is a copy of a blog post I've just written
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2011/07/easynetq-how-should-messaging-client.html">http://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2011/07/easynetq-how-should-messaging-client.html</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was wondering if anyone on the group had any good suggestions for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> error handling strategies?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> EasyNetQ&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/mikehadlow/EasyNetQ">https://github.com/mikehadlow/EasyNetQ</A>&gt;  is my simple .NET
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> API for RabbitMQ.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've started thinking about the best patterns for implementing error
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handling in EasyNetQ. One of the aims of EasyNetQ is to remove as many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> infrastructure concerns from the application developer as possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This means that the API should correctly handle any exceptions that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bubble up from the application layer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of the core requirements is that we shouldn't lose messages when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the application throws. The question then becomes: where should the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message, that the application was consuming when it threw, go? There
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seem to be three choices:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     1. Put the failed message back on the queue it was consumed from.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     2. Put the failed message on an error queue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     3. A combination of 1 and 2.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Option 1*has the benefit that it's the out-of-the-box behaviour of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AMQP. In the case of EasyNetQ, I would simply catch any exceptions,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> log them, and just send a noAck command back to RabbitMQ. Rabbit would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> put the message at the back of the queue and then resend it when it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> got to the front.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another advantage of this technique is that it gives competing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consumers the opportunity to process the message. If you have more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than one consumer on a queue, Rabbit will send the messages to them in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turn, so this is out-of-the-box.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The drawback of this method is that there's the possibility of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> queue filling up with failed messages. The consumer would just be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cycling around throwing exceptions and any messages that it might be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to to consume would be slowed down by having to wait their turn
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amongst a long queue of failed messages.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another problem is that it's difficult to manually inspect the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages and selectively delete or retry them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Option 2*is harder to implement. I would have to catch exceptions,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> log them and then write the message to an error queue. I would need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> write an error queue consumer to store the messages in a database. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would then need to provide the user with some way to inspect the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages alongside the error that caused them to arrive in the error
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> queue so that they could make a ignore/retry decision.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I could also implement some kind of wait-and-retry function on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> error queue, but that would also add additional complexity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It has the advantage that the original queue remains clear of failing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages. Failed messages and the error condition that caused the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> failure can be inspected together, and failed messages can be manually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ignored or retried.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With the failed messages sitting in a database, it would also be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple to create a mechanism where those messages could be replayed on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a developer machine to aid in debugging.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *A combination of 1 and 2*. I'm moving towards thinking that a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> combination of 1&amp;  2 might be the best strategy. When a message fails
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initially, we simply noAck it and it goes back to the queue. AMQP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provides a Redelivered flag, so when the messages is consumed a second
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time we can be aware that it's a retry. Unfortunately there doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seem to be a retry count in AMQP, so the best we can do is allow for a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single retry. This has the benefit that it gives a competing consumer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a chance to process the message.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After the single retry we fall back to *Option 2*. The message is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passed to the error queue on the second failure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would be very interested in hearing how other people have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented error handling with AMQP/RabbitMQ.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Many thanks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
