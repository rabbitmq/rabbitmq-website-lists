&gt;<i> What happens to messages in durable queues which have already been _read_ but which have not yet been _acked_ when:

They are requeued to the back of the queue.

This is only relevant for persistent messages - transient messages will
be lost if rabbit dies in any way.

The one exception to the requeuing at the back rule is if rabbit is hard
killed. There's a possibility that the fact that the message has been
delivered to a consumer has not been successfully recorded on disk. As
such, on recovery, the message may reappear at the front of the queue,
rather than the back.

&gt;<i> The rabbitmq documentation gives me the impression that I can read
</I>&gt;<i> messages from a durable queue and choose not to ack them until I  want
</I>&gt;<i> -- perhaps hours later.  Obviously, I have to watch my queue sizes in

</I>&gt;<i> messages before it terminates?  What will happen when the
</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmq-server is restarted or when or the program is restarted, will
</I>&gt;<i> it get the messages again?
</I>
They are requeued to the back of the queue.

&gt;<i> Suppose I have multiple consumers reading from the same durable queue
</I>&gt;<i> in a round robin fashion (read ahead is 1) and one consumer has read
</I>&gt;<i> but not acked 10 messages.
</I>
Not possible. If qos prefetch is 1 then that consumer will be sent at
most 1 message at a time and will then receive no more until it acks
that message.

&gt;<i>  If it dies, or at least closes the
</I>&gt;<i> connection abruptly, will those 10 messages be sent to the other
</I>&gt;<i> consumers to read?
</I>
Yes.
