Under what circumstances did messages get lost? When killing the broker?

I could see that happening if the broker is killed during the tx.commit 
- the 'ack' may get processed before the 'publish', and if the broker is 
nuked in-between the latter would get lost.

'confirms' would be a better way to handle the above scenario, i.e. wait 
for confirmation of the 'publish' and only then send the ack.

Regards,

Matthias.
