</I>The problem usually manifests after one of the machines reboots. I have a baby sitter that does 2 things: 1) make sure rabbit is up and 2) make sure the cluster is fully formed. In either test fails, it will issue an '/etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server restart'

When we get into this state, it is usually our watchdog that gets things back up and running.

Perhaps our watchdogs are running too frequently (once a minute). I'll back off their aggressiveness to see if that doesn't help things.

Further, the machines involved here are virtual machines. I see the problem more when I have a single CPU than when I have multiple.

I will try this, thanks!
