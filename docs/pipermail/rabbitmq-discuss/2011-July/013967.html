<PRE>Hi Matthias,

Thank you for your response.

Yes, I have gone through your tutorial.

It looks like the (workers --&gt; parent) case is handled by a code similar to your FIRST example.

Also, it looks like the (parent --&gt; workers) case is handled by a code similar to your THIRD example (parent is a publisher, fanout, all workers are consumers).

I was able to combine both cases into one piece of code, and it works.

The problem that I have is that the code *hangs* on sending / receiving messages, leaving no room for my actual app to run.

I think this is due to the 'start_consuming' function call, which runs infinitely and won't let any code underneath it to get executed.

Is there a way to have the messaging run in the *background* -- thus, not blocking the regular work of the app?

Thanks,
Shalom.

As Jason suggested, the parent-&gt;child messaging could be accomplished 
with a fanout exchange an private per-worker queues.

And for the child-&gt;parent communication, just get the parent to create a 
queue with a well-known name and get the children to publish to that via 
the default exchange.

If you haven't done so already, please go through our tutorials at
