<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> How bad would be the contention n and m are fairly large?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...or do I just need to have enough broker?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it's just the *numbers* of producers/consumers that are large, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than the message rates, then you can scale beyond a single broker by adding
</I>&gt;<i> nodes. That does work for coping with increased message rates too to a
</I>&gt;<i> degree, but the single queue will become a bottle neck at some point and
</I>&gt;<i> clustering won't help to overcome that.
</I>
That's what I thought. But I guess when that happens one could just
create separate &quot;pools&quot; of producers and consumers and just replicate
the setup. Each would have a single queue and that would be fine.

&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a away to tell the fanout consumer to deliver every message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to Q1 but only every 10th message to Q2?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How else could one do this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you just concerned about the 2nd queue filling up? Then perhaps set a
</I>&gt;<i> message ttl on the queue
</I>
I am just not sure even just consuming the messages on a single
consumer (and only processing every n-th) will be fast enough. At some
stage one consumer could be just too slow just consuming. Not sure
when that would happen and if that is really is problem - but I would
assume it could become one.

This is about getting a smaller sample of the messages going through
the producer consumer chain. Setting a ttl would probably do the wrong
thing as it would drop the message not uniformly.

cheers,
Torsten
