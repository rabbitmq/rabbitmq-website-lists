<PRE>Steve,

Can you please clarify your post a bit for me:

You say that a client application may continue to use a Channel from  
its main thread even if the RabbitMQ client library uses the same  
Channel for async receiving.

How is the use of a Channel from the RabbitMQ client library  
connection thread sychronized with the use of the same Channel from  
the client application thread?

Is such concurrent Channel access different from a situation when two  
client application threads access the same Channel concurrently?

Cheers
Jiri


&gt;<i> Jiri,
</I>&gt;<i> The current implementation of the Java Client calls the Consumer  
</I>&gt;<i> interface on the same thread that the Channel work is done on.  This  
</I>&gt;<i> means that anything done in the Consumer callbacks is synchronised  
</I>&gt;<i> with all the other channel stuff going on, and could potentially  
</I>&gt;<i> block it.  There are notes on the api-guide pages to warn you about  
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The QueueingConsumer class basically makes sure that the Consumer  
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks do not cause any problems, putting the messages on the  
</I>&gt;<i> (dedicated) queue for any (usually the main) thread to access them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means that, even though there may be many consumers defined for  
</I>&gt;<i> a Channel, ownership of the Channel is not passed to the 'lib's  
</I>&gt;<i> connection thread', and you can continue to use the Channel from the  
</I>&gt;<i> main thread, or whatever thread you have allocated to run it from.   
</I>&gt;<i> You can ack messages, and anything else you want, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The thing you shouldn't do is to call Channel methods (for the same  
</I>&gt;<i> channel) from more than one thread at a time.  This is because the  
</I>&gt;<i> threading model in the channel is 'challenged'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are currently working on the Consumer and Channel threading  
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions -- we want to run all the Consumer callbacks on a  
</I>&gt;<i> thread which is distinct from the Connection thread; and allow  
</I>&gt;<i> channels to be driven from multiple threads.  This would mean it is  
</I>&gt;<i> feasible to do most Channel operations from the Consumer callback  
</I>&gt;<i> itself, and from any other thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Incidentally, the way our changes are going at the moment, we will  
</I>&gt;<i> expose the execution thread pool for Consumer callbacks; and allow  
</I>&gt;<i> the user to have control over how many threads are allocated.  For  
</I>&gt;<i> example, it might be thought sensible to have a single thread per  
</I>&gt;<i> channel allocated for Consumer callbacks; but this could mean a  
</I>&gt;<i> large penalty for a large number of channels that may be doing very  
</I>&gt;<i> little work.  Instead we pass work to an Executor (managed so that  
</I>&gt;<i> all the work required by a single channel is serialised) which runs  
</I>&gt;<i> it on a thread from a pool.  The default Executor will use a (fixed)  
</I>&gt;<i> pool of 16 threads, but the interface will allow passing in any  
</I>&gt;<i> Executor implementation for the Connection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this helps.  Feedback is welcome.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm trying to understand the limitations of using a Channel in a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> post...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have read <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#channel-threads">http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#channel-threads</A> but

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The moment I call basicConsume(), I would imagine the Channel becomes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;owned&quot; by the client lib's connection thread, which feeds messages to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> QueueingConsumer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My app is retrieving those messages from the QueueingConsumer in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> main thread. I would like to know to which extent can I keep using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Channel passed to basicConsume() from the main thread.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess I can use it to ack messages, because ack would not work on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another channel, correct? Can I also use the channel for other things,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such as sending messages, using transactions, or starting another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subscription?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JMS specs seem to be quite explicit on this. It says a session with an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> active subscription is owned by the connection thread and client app
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> threads cannot use the session; they can only shut it down. That's why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if I want multiple subscriptiopns on one session, I must set them all up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before I call Connection.start(), which passes the session ownership to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the client library. Afterwards I can no longer use the session from my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> threads except closing it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Could you please elaborate on how exactly this works in the rabbit Java
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers
