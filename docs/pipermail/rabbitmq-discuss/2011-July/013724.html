<PRE>Hi Simone,

I agree. You can either have flexibility or you can have simplicity. My aim is to provide an 'opinionated' API that forces you to use RabbitMQ in a very specific way. Of course this won't be for everyone, but for a large number of people it will give them a pre-built toolkit that they can just start using with a couple of lines of code.

Having said that I don't see a problem with providing pluggable strategies for things like durability and error handling. EasyNetQ could provide sensible defaults out-of-the-box that would allow a user to get up and running fast, but then have some configuration that allows you to choose throughput over durability and different error handling options.

Mike

Hi Mike, building a high level API on top of RabbitMQ is something I've been thinking about as well, and I looked at your OS project too. The issue I've been facing with every abstraction I could think of is that somewhere you have to make some assumptions - for example about durability, exchange types, how you handle errors and so on - therefore I think it's quite hard to come up with something which works in most scenarios. The same consideration applies to the supplied WCF bindings as well.

Subject: Re: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ .NET Client. Questions about QueueingBasicConsumer

Thanks Emile, Simone.

I'll check out the channel QoS. The main reason I'm writing my own wrapper around QueueingBasicConsumer is because I'm multiplexing multiple subscriptions on a single consumer loop. I want the user of the API to simply call:

Subscribe&lt;MyMessage&gt;(MsgHandler);

And then have the API handle all the details :)

Mike

Hi Mike,

As Simone says, setting QoS on the channel will prevent a consumer from being flooded by messages.

You may also want to look at the Subscription class, another wrapper around QueueingBasicConsumer:
