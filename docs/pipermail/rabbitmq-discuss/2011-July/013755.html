As Michael said, yes, that's easy.

&gt;<i> I also assume for this scenario a direct exchange would do?

Yes.

</I>
If it's just the *numbers* of producers/consumers that are large, rather 
than the message rates, then you can scale beyond a single broker by 
adding nodes. That does work for coping with increased message rates too 
to a degree, but the single queue will become a bottle neck at some 
point and clustering won't help to overcome that.

&gt;<i> I would also like to be able to &quot;tap into&quot; the stream of messages

</I>&gt;<i> instead. Have the normal queue with the m consumers and a second queue
</I>&gt;<i> with a single consumer &quot;tapping in&quot;.
</I>
Yep, that would work.


&gt;<i> Is there a away to tell the fanout consumer to deliver every message
</I>&gt;<i> to Q1 but only every 10th message to Q2?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i> How else could one do this?
</I>
Are you just concerned about the 2nd queue filling up? Then perhaps set 
a message ttl on the queue 
(<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#queue-ttl">http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#queue-ttl</A>). Or use the 
'immediate' flag on publish - though I'd discourage that.


Regards,

Matthias.
