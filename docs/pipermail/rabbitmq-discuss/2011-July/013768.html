&gt;<i> so, what's currently the best way to publish messages consumed from one
</I>&gt;<i> queue into another with the amqp gem? This is quite important in processing
</I>&gt;<i> scenaria when no messages may be lost.
</I>

Michael,

Does this piece of code look like what you would like to have? An entity
that consumes messages from one queue and republishes them safely into
another queue, with a way to transform the message?

This imaginary AMQP::Rebroadcaster is not that difficult to design and add
to the amqp gem for RC14 (will be out in a few weeks after
some more testing with real world apps).
