<PRE>Thanks Michael and Matt.

In the attached, Matt says that with a QOS/prefetch of 1, I rabbitmq will not let me read more than one message without acking it.

So, is it true then that if I set the prefetch number to  10, I can read up to 10 without acking any of them?

Thanks,
   Lowell

They are requeued to the back of the queue.

This is only relevant for persistent messages - transient messages will
be lost if rabbit dies in any way.

The one exception to the requeuing at the back rule is if rabbit is hard
killed. There's a possibility that the fact that the message has been
delivered to a consumer has not been successfully recorded on disk. As
such, on recovery, the message may reappear at the front of the queue,
rather than the back.

They are requeued to the back of the queue.

&gt;<i> Suppose I have multiple consumers reading from the same durable queue
</I>&gt;<i> in a round robin fashion (read ahead is 1) and one consumer has read
</I>&gt;<i> but not acked 10 messages.
</I>
Not possible. If qos prefetch is 1 then that consumer will be sent at
most 1 message at a time and will then receive no more until it acks
that message.

&gt;<i>  If it dies, or at least closes the
</I>&gt;<i> connection abruptly, will those 10 messages be sent to the other
</I>&gt;<i> consumers to read?
</I>
Yes.
