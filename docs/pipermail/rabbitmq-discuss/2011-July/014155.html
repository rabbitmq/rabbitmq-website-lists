Ahh well it should have been on 12th July. A while ago, several of us
thought we had a meeting in which we'd agreed to switch to a monthly
release cycle, and indeed for a while we did monthly releases. However,
for unclear reasons this no longer seems to be the case.

So your guess is as good as mine.
