Right. This is definitely possible that channels are the main
thing that consumes memory.

&gt;<i> Once the number of channels is down to less than 10, the memory usage
</I>&gt;<i> is around 32M, which seems fine to me. Maybe I don't need to allocate
</I>&gt;<i> more, if I can solve this channels problem.
</I>
Yup, quite possible.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is there an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> option to get the server to return something that says that it is not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> accepting messages?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In ancient history we used to do this; there's a method in AMQP 0-9-1 called
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel.flow which the server should be able to use to tell a client to shut
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up. In practice it was unreliable (client may not support it, or may take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too long to take notice of it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will do some more testing. Maybe the immediate flag on basic_publish
</I>&gt;<i> will do something useful. python amqplib is protocol version 0.8, so
</I>&gt;<i> whatever I do must fit in with that.
</I>
Nope, &quot;immediate&quot; flag is a completely unrelated:
