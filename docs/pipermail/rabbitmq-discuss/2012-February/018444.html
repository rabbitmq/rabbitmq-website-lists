Our local Erlang expert is on vacation, but he rescued our cluster.
He described a mailbox full of messages that some process was not
consuming.  When he killed the process and, IIRC, the &quot;shell&quot; that had
spawned it (I am merely parroting what I recall, this may be the wrong
term), the bloat was cured and memory usage returned to normal.

Details that might matter in reproduction:  Our troubled mirrored
queue used mode &quot;nodes&quot; (not &quot;all&quot;), picking two nodes out of a
cluster of four.  When I created it, I used a modified rabbitmqadmin
that connected to one of the two nodes, and specified that it and one
other node should mirror the queue.  All messages were written with
delivery-mode 2.  Messages are about 46K each.  While some of the
messages were consumed, most were purged.  Queue deletion did not cure
the leak.
