The report you posted showed most memory in the VM being used by Erlang 
processes. You could run something like:

rabbitmqctl eval 
'lists:sublist(lists:reverse(lists:sort([{process_info(Pid,memory), Pid, 
process_info(Pid)} || Pid &lt;- processes()])), 10).'

to list the top 10 processes by memory use, along with some information 
for each one. This may tell us something interesting.

Having said that, 100Mb for an idle server does not seem totally 
unreasonable - RabbitMQ is not optimised for small memory use when idle.

&gt;<i> It is running on a deliberately small VM. As it is the only service on

</I>
The reason we set 0.4 is that in a worst case scenario memory use can 
double during GC. That's relatively unlikely though and assuming you 
have some swapspace as well it will not be too bad if you do.

Cheers, Simon
