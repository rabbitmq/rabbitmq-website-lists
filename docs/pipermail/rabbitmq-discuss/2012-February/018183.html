<PRE>
Good evening. I am a new user of rabbitMQ. I have worked through the rabbitMQ tutorials and implemented a very simple direct exchange queue.

How would one persist messages on the directed exchange? I want to do this so that a consumer in a while loop will see the messages right when they are posted, and other instances of consumers can pull a message selectively off the queue. This latter group may issue such a request after the original message has been posted.

My messages are directed to exchanges by a qmsgTarget field. My messages have a field in their structure called srcId. My messages also have a field in their structure called seqNum. Thus a consumer may wish to say &quot;Please get me message 3 from srcid 666 from the qmsgtarget Server direct exchange&quot;. Another consumer may later issue the same request, so this third message in the sequence for srcid 666 must remain on the directed exchange.

I will be implementing a method deleteQmsg() that I intend to use to delete messages selectively.

Is it possible using rabbitMQ to implement this? Can anyone point me towards a similar example?
