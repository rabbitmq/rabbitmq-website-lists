<PRE>Hi Jerry,

OK, I think I understand now.

I think I will have my consumer create the two queues on the fly. These queues (&quot;heartbeat&quot; and &quot;management&quot;) need live only for the duration of the long running task. The consumer is the first to know that the task has been accepted for processing, so consumer is a natural place to create the queues.

Again, the scenario is:

1. monitor sends heartbeat messages to the heartbeat queue; consumer receives them. 
2. a producer (in a higher layer) sends management messages to the management queue; monitor receives them.

Given what you said about queue creation idempotency, I trust it can't hurt if the other endpoint also declares the queue. E.g., in case (1) monitor declares the queue; in case (2) both producer and monitor declare the queue (in case (2) the queue was created by an entity that is not involved in the communication, i.e., consumer created it, but it is used by producer and monitor).

But I am uncertain about the &quot;bind&quot; operation. The sense I have is that only a receiver need bind (with a specific binding key) the queue to the exchange. Is that right?

Thanks for your help.

Cordially,

Paul

Hi Jerry,

Yeah, I think that makes sense.

Could your two queue be characterized like this:

1. Monitor creates the HB queue. With binding key &quot;HB,&quot; consumer binds this queue to the exchange. Monitor writes to exchange with routing-key &quot;HB.&quot;

2. Producer creates the MGMT queue. With binding key &quot;MGMT,&quot; monitor binds this queue to exchange. Producer writes to exchange with routing-key &quot;MGMT.&quot;

As always, thank you.

-Paul

</I>&gt;<i> All,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Only after trying to think through a real world scenario did I realize that my grasp of certain fundamental AMQP concepts is tenuous.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically, given a producer and a consumer, is the normative behavior for only *one* of them to declare (create?) the queue over which they communicate? As I look over the examples that I've &quot;written&quot; (&quot;copied&quot; would be more accurate), I see my producer doing this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitAdmin admin = new RabbitAdmin(rabbitTemplate.getConnectionFactory());
</I>&gt;<i> Exchange ex = new FanoutExchange(routingKey, true, false);
</I>&gt;<i> admin.declareExchange(ex);
</I>&gt;<i> admin.declareQueue(new Queue(this.queueName));
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And I see my consumer doing this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ConsumerSimpleMessageListenerContainer container = new ConsumerSimpleMessageListenerContainer();
</I>&gt;<i> container.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory());
</I>&gt;<i> container.setQueueNames(this.queueName);
</I>&gt;<i> container.setConcurrentConsumers(this.onOfConsumer);
</I>&gt;<i> container.setMessageListener(new MessageListenerAdapter(new ConsumerHandler(), new SimpleMessageConverter()));
</I>&gt;<i> container.startConsumers();
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What would happen if each declared a queue of the same name and type - would that give rise to two distinct queues, leaving the producer and consumer unable to communicate?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it's normative for only one party to create the queue and the other to bind to it, what will happen if, when I try to bind to the queue, it doesn't yet exist?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's what I am trying to get to (I assume it requires a topic exchange):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a. a queue that holds two different message types, call them &quot;MGMT&quot; and &quot;HB.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> b. a producer writes MGMT messages to this queue
</I>&gt;<i> c. something called a &quot;monitor&quot; writes HB messages to this queue
</I>&gt;<i> d. consumer reads HB messages from this queue
</I>&gt;<i> e. monitor reads MGMT messages from this queue
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Schematically I think it looks like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Producer(MGMT) -&gt; monitor
</I>&gt;<i> Monitor(HB)    -&gt; consumer
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How would I define these relationships via RabbitMQ? Who does what to whom?! I suspect it's simple, but after two solid weeks of 10 hour days, I am fried.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your help.
</I>&gt;<i>
