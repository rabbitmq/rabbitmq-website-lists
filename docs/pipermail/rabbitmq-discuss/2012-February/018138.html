<PRE>Hi Simon,

Thanks for looking into the logs. Since we fixed channel leak in our
application we do not experience any problems anymore.

Regarding transient queues in HA. I am just not sure how system would
behave when non-HA queue is declared in a cluster environment.
Documentation describes in great details what happen to mirrored queues but
I can't find anything about non-ha queue in HA cluster. Queue will be
created on a single server, and application should be ready to re-declare
queue in case of failover. So far so good. But how does it work with load
balancer? When request is made against a server which does not have a given
queue, will the cluster &quot;know&quot; where the queue is and proxy the request to
the proper server?

Thanks,
Vadim.

</I>&gt;<i> autodelete / exclusive queues. So although they're &quot;HA&quot;, they will vanish
</I>&gt;<i> if any of the following happens:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The entire cluster goes down (transient) or
</I>&gt;<i> * All consumers for a queue cancel (autodelete) or
</I>&gt;<i> * The connection that created them closes (exclusive)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this intentional? It seems like an odd use of HA.
</I>&gt;<i>
