<PRE>Thanks again, Simon.

Some idle replies, and one more question, in-line...

Agreed. But I am pretty sure that this is what NetApp implemented. So they're stuck with MD5.

&gt;<i>Actually, you don't want to just &quot;present a hashed password&quot; since that

</I>&gt;<i>that it's not really hashed any more...
</I>
I suppose you mean that the client must be able to present it as clear text to the filer's MD5 algorithm.

My question: is it possible to adjust the &quot;concurrency&quot; of a consumer in real time? That is, when I create a consumer with

     Consumer consumer = new Consumer(&quot;q1&quot;, &quot;q1&quot;, 3);

I get a single consumer that runs 3 threads. Can I adjust this &quot;3&quot; dynamically?

Thanks again.
