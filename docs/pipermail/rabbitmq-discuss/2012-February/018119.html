That's plausible, but I don't think that's what's happening (there's 
nothing about network partitioning in the logs).

Thanks. I've had a poke at this but nothing is leaping out at me yet. 
I'll keep at it though.

One thing that's a bit odd: you seem to be creating HA / transient / 
autodelete / exclusive queues. So although they're &quot;HA&quot;, they will 
vanish if any of the following happens:

* The entire cluster goes down (transient) or
* All consumers for a queue cancel (autodelete) or
* The connection that created them closes (exclusive)

Is this intentional? It seems like an odd use of HA.

Cheers, Simon
