Does it mean that every page is user specific? Or is &quot;user&quot; exchange
not for per-user messages but rather global ones?

I'm not sure what your scale is, but this setup has a good property -
it should be relatively easy to shard it. So it's generally reasonable.

&gt;<i>&#160;My concern is whether
</I>&gt;<i> rabbit likes having thousands or tens of thousands of queues created
</I>&gt;<i> and torn down every few minutes. &#160;I seem to recall that it didn't like

</I>&gt;<i> lately, so I figured I'd ask if that's a sane thing to do these days.

Like always - you need to prototype and benchmark it :)

But generally, I would probably go for a different setup.

I think we can assume with reasonable confidence that number
of concurrent users on your site is constant. (as opposed to
dynamic pages AFAIU)

So why not create queue-per-user? (for users actively browsing).

When user enters a page - you can subscribe the queue to a per-page
exchange. When user navigates away - you unsubscribe.

Of course, this has some limitations - you may want to buffer
data per-page, and this setup can't do that easily (you would
need to use redis or something for that).

Hope that helps,
  Marek
