  &gt;&gt;While some may dislike to run a Java library in a Perl

  &gt;I'm sure you can understand that it's not really desirable 
for many
  &gt;people to do this, though, due to:
  &gt;[...]

Not only I can understand that, but I even wrote it in my 
original message if you look above.  :)

Implementing bindings for the official Java library was the 
quickest solution I could come up with, given the 
unresponsiveness of other modules' authors, the uncertain status 
of the C library, the incompleteness of STOMP modules with 
regards to the RabbitMQ feature set.

The recent announcement of a new maintainer for the C library is 
good news for us Perl users, of course. In the mean time, the 
Java library has been supporting my production servers with no issues.

  &gt;By the way - why do you require the user to call -&gt;init 
manually? Why
  &gt;not put that into the import() subroutine which is called automatically?

init() does a bit too much for it to be safely called 
automatically. Suppose you have a forking daemon: you probably 
want to load the Java part only after forking and after a number 
of other startup things. Having the user call it manually also 
allows to fine-tune it using runtime settings rather than 
hard-coded ones.

Cheers,
