Hi David,

You won't find any documentation on that port number, because it was
randomly assigned when your Erlang VM started up. If you reboot then it
will change. At the time when this diagnostic information was produced
the value was correct:

Error: unable to connect to node '<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at LAKE-DS140</A>': nodedown
diagnostics:
- nodes and their ports on LAKE-DS140: [{rabbit,1052}]

You can find the current set of ports by running &quot;epmd -names&quot;. You will
find epmd in the erts/bin folder of your Erlang installation.

&gt;<i> allocated time to get RabbitMQ up and running in a reasonably robust

</I>
Our aim is that you should have a single-node broker running in a few
minutes after downloading. It should not be a complicated affair to set
up. Clustering takes a bit more time to set up, so you should allow for
that. I'm in no position to validate estimates though! Please let us
have your suggestions for improvements to RabbitMQ that will help you
reach your goal.

&gt;<i> who isn't running a firewall on a production server.  If clustering

</I>
Clustering works fine through a firewall, provided that the instructions
here are followed:
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#firewall">http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#firewall</A>
If you have followed these instructions and run into difficulties then
please let us know.
