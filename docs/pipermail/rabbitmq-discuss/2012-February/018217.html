</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You have interpreted the documentation correctly:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; amqp_connection_state_t, its socket, and all associated amqp_channel_t's

</I>&gt;<i> to have a separate TCP connection for each one?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thats one way to do it.  Another would be to a have a &quot;connection thread&quot;
that would own the non-thread-safe objects, and would dispatch the messages
to the worker threads.  It takes a bit more code to accomplish it but its
similar to how the Java and .NET clients work, which have a thread that
handles events on a connection level, then the Channel objects associated
with the Connection object can be on different threads.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I assume if I'm going to use a c++ wrapper like
</I>&gt;<i> amqpcpp or rabbitcpp I'm going to have the same issue,
</I>&gt;<i> since they're using rabbitmq-c as the lower layer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Having not used either of those C++ wrappers I believe your assumption is
correct, unless the implement their own event-loop or thread that
dispatches consumed messages.

As a self-less plug, if you're looking for a C++ wrapper - I'd encourage
you to checkout SimpleAmqpClient <A HREF="https://github.com/alanxz/SimpleAmqpClient,">https://github.com/alanxz/SimpleAmqpClient,</A>
which is Yet Another rabbitmq-c wrapper.  It won't necessarily solve your
threading question though.
