With small messages in fact the first thing you run into is being 
CPU-bound making routing decisions. But the general principle holds, yes.

Ah, good.

I had a quick look at implementing non-blocking publish on Java on 
Friday. Unfortunately it's not possible to do this without NIO on Java, 
so a prerequisite becomes &quot;port the Java client to NIO&quot;, which... makes 
it less likely to happen I'm afraid.

Cheers, Simon
