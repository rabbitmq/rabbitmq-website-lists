Hi Matt.

</I>&gt;<i> Question: Does anybody (and particularly the RabbitMQ folks) have any

Not much really. We haven't tested extensively but if you got 5% I think 
you would consider yourself lucky.

However, 36 msg/s is *really* slow.

Although mirrored queues are slower than normal ones I would still hope 
you could stick a couple of zeroes on the end of that figure. So I 
suspect you are not actually CPU bound at the server.

I assume when you say &quot;using transactions&quot; you mean publishing a single 
message per transaction? In that case you are incurring the cost of a 
network round trip and an fsync() on each publish, and I suspect that is 
what is killing your performance.

If I had to guess I would suspect the fsync is the worst of the problem. 
Assuming the 36 msg/s is from some test app, you might want to remove 
the tx.select and replace the tx.commit with some meaningless 
synchronous request (basic.qos is a favourite) and see what happens to 
your message rate. If it shoots up, the fsync is the problem. If it 
doesn't, the network round trip is.

When you have the answer to that, you know whether you're going to want 
to spend money on fancy networking hardware or SSDs...

Of course, *really* I would suggest you need to be publishing more 
messages per round-trip / fsync. So either batch multiple publishes into 
a transaction or start using confirms instead. I know you say that they 
&quot;take away from the fundamental disaster hardness&quot; but I'm not sure I 
understand what you mean by that. Both confirms and tx give you a way to 
know when a given message is definitely on disc. And in fact tx is 
implemented in terms of confirms these days.

Cheers, Simon
