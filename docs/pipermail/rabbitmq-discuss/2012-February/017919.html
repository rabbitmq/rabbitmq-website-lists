<PRE>I'm writing some basic throughput tests to verify that RabbitMQ will scale
to our needs in HA environments. In one scenario I'm finding that consuming
messages as quickly as possible slows down consistently over time.

My environment:
* Ubuntu 10.04 with RabbitMQ 2.71.
* Erlang R13B03
* Broker instances are all disk nodes on a dedicated VM running nothing
else.
* Queues are declared as durable and x-ha-policy:all
* Clients are written in Python using Pika 0.9.5.
* For this test a single broker is used, but I have the same effect with
mirrored queues.
The test code is extremely simple. It simply reads or writes messages (up to
100,000) as quickly as it can, and shows the throughput rate at 1000 message
intervals.

I've noticed that when I use transactions with basic_ack, e.g.

        channel.tx_select()
        channel.basic_ack(delivery_tag=tag)
        channel.tx_commit()

that the rate I can consume messages drops steadily. Each time I restart my
reading app with a full queue, I see a consistent slowdown in my rate as
measured every 1000 messages:

(Rate for last 1000 messages | Average rate for all messages since app
start)
Read 597.502915814 messages/sec | Average: 597.502915814
Read 431.665048642 messages/sec | Average: 501.222607245

Read 222.953957109 messages/sec | Average: 317.260966009

If I simply remove the tx_select()/tx_commit, the rate stays reasonably
stable:

(Rate for last 1000 messages | Average rate for all messages since app start
Read 1228.77445722 messages/sec | Average: 1343.23656881

Read 1491.50216641 messages/sec | Average: 1265.7295908

One thing I have noticed is that in my client app machine, the CPU
percentage generally climbs over time, with the occasional brief drop back
to a prior %. This might point to a Pika issue in the transaction related
code, but it's not obvious to me from inspection of the code if so.

Here's the relevant snippets of my code:

def do_read(clientlib):
    for i in range(100000):
        _, ack_info = clientlib.read_message(QUEUENAME)
        if ack_info == None:
            print &quot;No messages to read - Exiting&quot;
            return
        clientlib.acknowledge_message(ack_info)


class Clientlib
    def connect(self, hostname, use_transactions):
        self.connection =
pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host=hostname, port=5672))
        self.channel = self.connection.channel()
        self.use_transactions = use_transactions

    def read_message(self, queue_name):
        method_frame, _, body = self.channel.basic_get(queue=queue_name)
        return body, (self.channel, method_frame.delivery_tag)

    def acknowledge_message(self, acknowledge_info):
        channel = acknowledge_info[0]
        tag = acknowledge_info[1]

        if self.use_transactions:
            channel.tx_select()

        channel.basic_ack(delivery_tag=tag)

        if self.use_transactions:
            channel.tx_commit()

Any ideas what the issue might be, or what I could be doing wrong?

Thanks,

Matt
