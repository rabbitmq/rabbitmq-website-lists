There isn't one. As in, there isn't really an overall master node.

Absolutely. The original master node *for a given queue* is the one that 
the client that first declared the queue was connected to. But then they 
can fail over to other nodes pretty arbitrarily.

&gt;<i> Another approach is to go off of whichever node has the statistics
</I>&gt;<i> database, but I'm unsure if there's a 1:1 correlation there.
</I>
Again, this is the first node with mgmt to come up, or some other node 
at random in the case of failover.

&gt;<i> Background info, in case it matters:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're using keepalived to maintain a virtual IP that all clients connect

</I>&gt;<i> master has messages that aren't in the slave node, a client that
</I>&gt;<i> connects via the VIP to the slave node and tries to read messages won't
</I>&gt;<i> see them as they're only on the master.
</I>
No, that's not correct. Messages are *always* read from the master node 
(for a given queue).

Cheers, Simon
