<PRE>Hi Sam.

It's definitely worth trying a new version of Erlang.  Something in the 14B range or newer should perform noticeably better.

Also, are you doing a basicGet or basicConsume when listening for the messages?

Cheers,

Chris

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a simple(ish) benchmark I've created, I have a daemon that blocks,

</I>&gt;<i> times of around 0.01s (the application performance issue we're seeing is
</I>&gt;<i> showing RabbitMQ about 3-4 times slower than Spread).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I realise it's quite likely the problem is something odd I'm doing, but
</I>&gt;<i> I just want to rule out anything obvious at this stage. Could it be OS,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm running on Debian Lenny, with RabbitMQ 2.7.1, and Erlang 12b3 (from

</I>&gt;<i> configuration, or any other factors I might be missing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The client is written in Perl, using a home-grown client (but based on

</I>&gt;<i> (likely?) it's not as efficient as it could be, and would be nice to
</I>&gt;<i> rule that out somehow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would appreciate any help.. apologies if I haven't given all the
</I>&gt;<i> relevant information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
