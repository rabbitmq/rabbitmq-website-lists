So we're comparing one topic exchange with multiple routing keys all 
feeding into one queue, versus one topic exchange with multiple routing 
keys each feeding into a separate queue?

There are a couple of differences which may or may not matter to you:

1) If more than one of your routing keys match a given message, that 
message would get duplicated to each queue in the multiple queue case.

2) By pushing all the messages into one queue you impose a total 
ordering on your messages, which you may want. But by splitting out the 
messages into multiple queues you may get better performance (if the 
performance of the queue is a limiting factor...)

Cheers, Simon
