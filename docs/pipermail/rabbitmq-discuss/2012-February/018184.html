<PRE>Hi Jerry,

My use case is a typical pub/sub. There is a farm of applications which
broadcast their state to eachother periodically. Each app creates its own
queue and binds it to a well-known broadcast (fanout) exchange.
  It is typical for pub/sub to use transient queues.
Besides pub/sub broadcast, applications use messaging for critical use
cases, such as quick cache invalidation, that's why HA is configured.

&gt;<i> Note that you can't straightforwardly redeclare a queue that had been on
</I>&gt;<i> a node that's gone down.  The cluster's metadata will still know about it
</I>&gt;<i> and prevent you from redeclaring it.
</I>
The above is the only reason I still declare transient queue an HA. I
wouldn't like it when a failed node cause errors in applications.

Unless you mean that the above applies to a persistent queue only?
Otherwise I do not see how transient queue can be used in a cluster
environment. If a node goes down and there is no way to re-declare a queue
with the same name, it very likely breaks the application tier.

To summarize,
  critical use cases -&gt; HA cluster (AKA active/active)
  pub/sub use case -&gt; transient queues
  don't want failed node to cause lost queue -&gt; forced to declare transient
HA queue?

Thanks,
Vadim.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take a look at:  <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It summarizes what data lives where in a cluster.  In particular, that

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Simon,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for looking into the logs. Since we fixed channel leak in our
</I>&gt;<i> application we do not experience any problems anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding transient queues in HA. I am just not sure how system would
</I>&gt;<i> behave when non-HA queue is declared in a cluster environment.
</I>&gt;<i> Documentation describes in great details what happen to mirrored queues but
</I>&gt;<i> I can't find anything about non-ha queue in HA cluster. Queue will be
</I>&gt;<i> created on a single server, and application should be ready to re-declare
</I>&gt;<i> queue in case of failover. So far so good. But how does it work with load
</I>&gt;<i> balancer? When request is made against a server which does not have a given
</I>&gt;<i> queue, will the cluster &quot;know&quot; where the queue is and proxy the request to
</I>&gt;<i> the proper server?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Vadim.

</I>&gt;<i> if any of the following happens:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The entire cluster goes down (transient) or
</I>&gt;<i> * All consumers for a queue cancel (autodelete) or
</I>&gt;<i> * The connection that created them closes (exclusive)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this intentional? It seems like an odd use of HA.
