The only way to get a NOT_FOUND when declaring a queue is if the queue 
has previously been declared on a cluster node which is currently down. 
Does that describe your situation?

&gt;<i> I get the same error if I then try to delete it.

</I>
The default binding should not prevent you from declaring the queue.

&gt;<i>  Is there any way to solve this problem without

</I>
I think they would all have to be durable.

Cheers, Simon
