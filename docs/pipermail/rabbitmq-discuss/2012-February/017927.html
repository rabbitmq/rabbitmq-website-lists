AFAIK for publisher confirms to work you would need to drain events from
the connection.  Currently you are just writing data to the socket, and never
reading the replies back, so the callback won't be triggered.

Now, actually draining events while publishing messages is tricky in a blocking
application, you would have to find some smart way of alternating between reading
and writing to the socket.  Maybe there are mechanisms in pika for this, but I don't know.
