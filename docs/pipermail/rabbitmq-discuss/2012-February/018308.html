<PRE>Simone, 

Replies in-line below..

I don't think this is likely to change in the near future, since it
would be disruptive to most clients that use this.

&gt;<i> Without relying on the management plugin I think the only way to do that is to

The spec goes on to say:

  The client MAY ask the server to assert that a queue exists without creating
  the queue if not. If the queue does not exist, the server treats this as a
  failure. Error code: not-found

&gt;<i> There is no mention of channel closure, while the last sentence implies that
</I>&gt;<i> using the passive bit is indeed a way for a client to check queue existence, so
</I>&gt;<i> closing the channel when it doesn&#8217;t is a bit unexpected. That said, it&#8217;s not a
</I>&gt;<i> big deal to recreate the channel in such cases, but I&#8217;d appreciate your opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> Any chance this behavior can be changed in the client libraries?
</I>
This is the mention of channel-closure -- an 'error' raised on the channel will
close it.
