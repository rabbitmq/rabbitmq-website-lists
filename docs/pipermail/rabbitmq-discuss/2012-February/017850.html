I'm sure you can understand that it's not really desirable for many 
people to do this, though, due to:
  * Massively higher memory usage.
  * Longer start-up times.
  * Sysadmins' unfamiliarity with JVM deployment, tuning, failure modes, 
etc.
  * JVM incompatibility with OpenVZ containers.
  * The general nervousness you get when playing around with somewhat 
esoteric magic inter-language bindings like Inline::Java.


To be fair, you can tune the JVM memory use with some environment 
variables - but by default with Net::RabbitMQ::Java, the jvm portion 
grabs 1906M (virtual), which you have to admit is rather excessive. (You 
can enable memory over-commit on your Linux system, but by default it's 
still only going to let you run a couple of those jvms up before it 
starts complaining)


I admit, it's a interesting endeavour that you have here. I didn't 
realise you were actually using it seriously in the field though.

By the way - why do you require the user to call -&gt;init manually? Why 
not put that into the import() subroutine which is called automatically?

Cheers,
Toby
