<PRE>Patrick

I really appreciate this feedback but we may require some help from
you, to achieve your expectations.

First off, please can you tell me what you think of the following:

* Jason Williams' post &quot;Rabbits and Warrens&quot; linked to from here:
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/how.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/how.html</A>

* Any other intros that catch your eye, linked to from the above URL

* Chapters 1-5 of the dotnet user guide.  Especially chapters 2 and 3.

* The AMQP 0-9-1 spec.

Tell us if we should be holding initial users' hands more and perhaps
making it easier to read these in the *correct order*.  What is the
correct order?  We need your advice to get it right.

Second, have you been able to do what Ben suggested and load the DLL
examples into Visual Studio?

What are the specific steps needed to go from there, to the 'one stop
shop' approach that you describe?  Are they (a) more examples; (b)
better examples; (c) closer links between examples in VS and the
various documents linked to from <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/how.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/how.html</A> ...
or (d) better packaging.

Cheers

alexis
