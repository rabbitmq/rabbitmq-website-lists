This is basically the JMS selector semantics, which IIRC are generally
implemented in the client  as opposed to the broker (I think that MQ
Series version 7 has some kind of server side support for this, but I
haven't used it myself).

We did look at this briefly, but decided to shelve this feature
because it is very difficult to implement on the broker side because
of the multi-dimensional indexes you'd have to maintain.

Having said that, maybe implementing it on the broker side is perhaps
being a bit too fancy - maybe you can just trade off network bandwidth
for broker side query complexity.

Having said this though, you'd probably want a way to reject messages
without having to nuke the channel.

HTH,

Ben
