&gt;<i> In order to allow our clients to always point to a single host,

</I>&gt;<i> issues with low-volume queues. It goes roughly like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Consumer starts and establishes a connection to lb1.
</I>&gt;<i> - lb1 forwards packets from the consumer to e.g. mq1.
</I>&gt;<i> - At this point, the consumer has an established connection to lb1,
</I>&gt;<i> mq1 has an established connection directly to the consumer, and
</I>&gt;<i> messages published to the queue reach the consumer.
</I>
So the consumer has two connections - one to lb1 and one to mq1? That 
seems weird.

Also, you say that mq1 has a connection *to* the consumer - are you 
implying that your load-balancing reverses the direction of connection 
establishment?

&gt;<i> - After ~5-10 minutes without messages published to the queue, the
</I>&gt;<i> connection on the consumer goes away, and it establishes a new
</I>&gt;<i> connection to lb1. mq1 at this point still has an established to
</I>&gt;<i> connection to the consumer on the original port, in addition to the
</I>&gt;<i> new connection. Messages published to the queue in question are now no
</I>&gt;<i> longer delivered to the consumer.
</I>
Any idea what causes the original connection to get dropped?

Also, what client are you using, and do you have heartbeats enabled on 
the AMQP connection?

&gt;<i> - We start another consumer, but it doesn't receive messages either.
</I>&gt;<i> - After some more time, the original connection times out
</I>&gt;<i> ({inet_error,etimedout}), and messages get processed again, but only
</I>&gt;<i> by the second consumer.
</I>
That's a bit strange ... I would expect at least *some* messages to make 
it through via the new connections, since the queue delivers messages 
round-robin(ish) to connected consumers.

&gt;<i> The problem seems to be the load balancer dropping connections, but
</I>&gt;<i> since we're using it successfully in a few other cases, I thought I
</I>&gt;<i> could get some input on whether this is even a sensible strategy for
</I>&gt;<i> doing failover for RabbitMQ, and if anyone has experience with setups
</I>&gt;<i> similar to ours.
</I>
I am pretty sure some folks have used RabbitMQ behind a load balancer. 
Rabbit doesn't do anything fancy at the TCP/IP level, so generally this 
should work ok.

&gt;<i> PS: We're also seeing plenty of this in the rabbit.log, repeating
</I>&gt;<i> every 30 seconds:
</I>&gt;<i> =ERROR REPORT==== 27-Jul-2009::16:27:24 ===
</I>&gt;<i> ** Generic server &lt;0.9049.9&gt; terminating
</I>&gt;<i> ** Last message in was {inet_async,#Port&lt;0.222&gt;,41513,{ok,#Port&lt;0.236483&gt;}}
</I>&gt;<i> ** When Server state == {state,{rabbit_networking,start_client,[]},
</I>&gt;<i>                              #Port&lt;0.222&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i>                              41513}
</I>&gt;<i> ** Reason for termination ==
</I>&gt;<i> ** {{badmatch,{error,enotconn}},
</I>&gt;<i>   [{tcp_acceptor,handle_info,2},
</I>&gt;<i>    {gen_server,handle_msg,6},
</I>&gt;<i>    {proc_lib,init_p,5}]}
</I>
That looks like a connection is getting dropped before the server has 
completed accepting it. I have never seen this before, so would suspect 
your load balancer is doing something weird.


Regards,

Matthias.
