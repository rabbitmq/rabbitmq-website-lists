<PRE>Hi

Iam using the RabbitMQ client for .NET . I need to re subscribe to the
queue from my client if the connection drops or queue deletes. 
Iam getting the following error when trying to resubscribe to the queue.
[AMQP Heartbeat Inbound for Connection
amqp-0-<A HREF="8://GBWMAPPROPP04.emea.win.ml.com:5672]">8://GBWMAPPROPP04.emea.win.ml.com:5672]</A> ERROR

code=0, text=&quot;End of stream&quot;, classId=0, methodId=0,

Is there a way to identify if the queue is locked exclusively?

Thanks
Rajesh
