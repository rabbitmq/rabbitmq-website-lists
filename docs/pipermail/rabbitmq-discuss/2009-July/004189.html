<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Couple of basic questions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) So, for reference, would we call this AMQPS, AMQP-SSL, or SAMPQ ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does it have to have a name?
</I>
Well, AMQP over SSL is a little long; plus, I assume IANA will want a
protocol name if you're going to make 5672 (amqp) and 5673 (amqps) in
/etc/services as standards.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Are you planning on supporting CRLs and/or OCSP for certificate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> revocation?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Can we specify the cipher strength?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We support whatever the Erlang SSL implementation supports. See
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/new_ssl.html">http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/new_ssl.html</A> for details. That's a moving
</I>&gt;<i> target, and ATM the answers to the above are 'no' and 'yes'.
</I>
Okay, gotcha.  #2 wasn't a hard requirement, I was just more
interested to see if it was on anyone's radar.

&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Okay once SSL is supported natively, do you think a future version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of RabbitMQ would be able to map particular subjectDNs to existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> username/password credentials? &#160;It would be really nice if clients
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could authenticate with only client certs and nothing else.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm guessing #4 may actually break the existing AMQP spec, since we're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> talking about bypassing username/password authentication. &#160;If that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the case, I'm not sure if you typically wait for the spec to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ratified before implementing any experimental features, such as this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AMQP has some built-in support for negotiating different security
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms, so your latter concern isn't an issue. Making the necessary
</I>&gt;<i> changes at the server and client end would take some time, but it shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> be a big job. Perhaps this is something you could have a stab at yourself
</I>&gt;<i> once the new SSL support has landed?
</I>
Depends.  I'm not an erlang expert by any means; I'm currently working
on integrating some erlang supervisory code.  Assuming I can grok the
syntax and language, I could take a stab at this later on.  A change
like this would probably also mean digging through the nmesia DB
schema, as the mappings would probably have to reside there (wherever
the username/passwords are stored).
