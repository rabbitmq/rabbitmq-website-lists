<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) no consumers ever subscribe to the &quot;logger&quot; queue. Why do you have the
</I>&gt;<i> logger queue at all?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This was my bad-- I for some reason thought you needed to declare a queue to
send messages to an exchange. Fixed that now, no more &quot;logger&quot; queue.


&gt;<i> 2) You are setting immediate=true. I'd advise against that, for reasons
</I>&gt;<i> I explained earlier. Setting exclusive or auto_delete on the queues, so
</I>&gt;<i> that they disappear when the consumers vanish, should be sufficient.
</I>

So I changed this now, exclusive=True and auto_delete=True and
immediate=False on the Producer. This fixes the &quot;memory leak.&quot; Everything
works the way I want and there's no mem usage growth or eventual crash. This
is on 1.6.0 BTW. I guess it had something to do w/ immediate=True, but I'm
not positive.


Also, if you still see the problem then, please post precise instructions on
&gt;<i> how to reproduce it -
</I>

If you want to see the mem growth, use the code (I've updated it) in my blog
post but just add immediate=True to the basic_publish command. Then I just
did

b = Producer()
for x in xrange(1000000):
    b.message({&quot;message&quot;:&quot;a long message&quot;, &quot;id&quot;:str(x)})

and you can just watch the mem increase, whether you have consumers or not.
(only if immediate=True is on)

thanks for all the help, I think we're doing good now.
