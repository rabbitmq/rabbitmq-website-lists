<PRE>Hi Tony,

Yes, we're running on a Mac. Don't know about the CPU as I  
unfortunately wasn't present when I happened. I'll check to and see if  
somebody else knows. Good to hear you have changed the startup script  
and we'll be careful to save the log-file if it happens again and  
check CPU utilization and if we can get an erlang shell.

Thank you for taking this so seriously. I will send you anything we  
discover, and please let me know if you find anything that you think  
might be relevant to this, or any experiments you would like us to try.

Regards,

Michael

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... which produces a &quot;Non-AMQP exit reason&quot; message in the log. I'm
