<PRE>Thanks for the quick response. That is exactly what I am facing right now. Will try the ack mode to None. Thank you.

Subject: Re: [rabbitmq-discuss] Spring amqp - auto acknowledge from consumer taking almost a minute

Yes; that assumption is wrong; in Spring-AMQP, ack mode AUTO means the container will automatically ack the message on completion. NONE is the equivalent of rabbit auto-ack.

Be aware that this can cause OOM issues with spring-AMQP versions prior to 1.3.0, if the consumers can't keep up with the workload because the broker will keep pumping messages to the client.

I have a spring amqp based application where the consumer is taking very long time to send acknowledgement. In RabbitMq management plugin, I see it in Unacknowledged state for almost a whole minute.I am currently testing this code by publishing only one message. But my prefetch count and transaction size are a 50 and 30 respectively. Could this be any reason for the issue?

My consumer has heavy processing. But since it is in auto acknowledge mode, I believe, the message will be acknowledged immediately after the consumer receives it and before it start processing the message. Is this assumption wrong?

Thanks,
Anita
