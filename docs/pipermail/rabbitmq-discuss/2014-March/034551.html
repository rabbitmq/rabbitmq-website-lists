<PRE>Hi Simon,

Thanks for the info. I guess I must have been lucky the previous times I had used the repository. We'll either build our own PPA or repo and use that instead. If we go down the PPA route, I'll post here to let others know about it.

Cheers

Chris

I'm afraid that's not possible. The apt repository is build from scratch at every release. Yeah, that's not ideal.

&gt;<i> I am

No, that's how it's always been.

</I>
The versions that make it into the Debian repos proper are almost identical to the ones we release, but our repo will tend to be a bit ahead of Debian.

Alternatively you can download old releases in .deb format from <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-server/.">http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-server/.</A> But of course that's no apt repository.

Cheers, Simon
