<PRE>Hey Nikolay,

Where I work we've opted to put a RabbitMQ broker on each physical machine 
in our live environment.
These brokers have a single exchange and queue both called &quot;local.outgoing&quot; 
(i.e. there's a single message stream)

There is then a central RabbitMQ broker with shovels configured to fetch 
messages from each machine.
The central RabbitMQ broker is where all the routing to queues takes place.

This means that:

   - It's unlikely that the local RabbitMQ broker instance is unreachable
   - Messages are queued at the local RabbitMQ broker if there are network 
   problems until they're resolved
   - Apps don't have to maintain state (unless they need to for another 
   reason)
   - Apps are dumb, they just raise events (messages) but don't know who 
   cares and who they should send messages to, it's one big stream
   - We can upgrade, restart, re-configure the central RabbitMQ broker as 
   required without down-time or message loss

This is just a case study ;-) it may not match you're requirements
