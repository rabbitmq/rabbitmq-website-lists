Yes.

&gt;<i> If Site B then goes offline, what happens to

</I>&gt;<i> are available to fanout messages to?
</I>
They will sit in the upstream queue until site B comes back, then be 
republished there.

&gt;<i> 2) Shovel has &quot;More Control&quot; according to the documentation.
</I>
&quot;More control&quot; is a bit vague, but I am not quite sure how to improve 
it. It means that shovel is a lower-level tool; you're responsible for 
the wiring and it's a bit more YAFIYGI.

&gt;<i> My questions are: Am I missing the boat? Would Federation be much more
</I>&gt;<i> simple to setup? Would Federation even work in this scenario?
</I>
Really it's up to you. Where exchange federation would win in this 
scenario is if you want to ensure that only messages which are actually 
needed at site B (because there's an appropriately bound queue) get sent 
there - federation is aware of which bindings exist, shovel isn't.

&gt;<i> In addition: I would like to configure this whole thing via Puppet. I
</I>&gt;<i> know how to do it in the rabbitmq config for shovel but wouldn't this
</I>&gt;<i> require a restart when configuration changes are made?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Also, would the
</I>&gt;<i> federation configuration methods via the API lend itself to more simple
</I>&gt;<i> Puppetization through simple API calls for Federation setup?
</I>
Quite possibly.

The next release of RabbitMQ (3.3.0) will give you the option of 
configuring the shovel in a similar way to federation, via mgmt/ctl 
calls with changes applied immediately (see 
<A HREF="http://next.rabbitmq.com/shovel-dynamic.html">http://next.rabbitmq.com/shovel-dynamic.html</A>).

I don't know if that makes your choice harder ;-)

Cheers, Simon
