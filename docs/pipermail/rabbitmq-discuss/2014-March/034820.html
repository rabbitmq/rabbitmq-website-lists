<PRE>Thank you very much for your reply Michael.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My current understanding and questions:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) I don't see a need to have more than 1 Connection instance in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the servlet or the client. This connection should be created
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application or servlet startup and closed on shutdown. Are there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pitfalls with long-lived connections or is this all handled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by RabbitMQ
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (keep-alive)?
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ connections are supposed to be long-lived. Set heartbeat interval
</I>&gt;<i> to a lower value (say, 60 seconds) if you have a firewall between clients
</I>&gt;<i> and RabbitMQ.
</I>I added this bit to my connection factory:
     ConnectionFactory factory = newConnectionFactory();
     factory.setRequestedHeartbeat(60);
     theConnection = factory.newConnection();

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) How should I handle broken Connections to the broker? If a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> must be created, do all the channels need to be reopened as well?
</I>&gt;<i> If a connection fails, it needs to be reopened, as do all the channels
</I>&gt;<i> on it. Some clients support automatic recovery from TCP connection
</I>&gt;<i> failures. Java client will offer this feature in the upcoming 3.3.0 release.
</I>&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) It seems like it would be bad practice to create a new channel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time a web request wants to publish a message. Should I pool them?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Share
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a single one? Use ThreadLocals? Is there a problem if they're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> closed (the connection would be on shutdown though)? The java
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client api
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documentation states that channels *should* be closed but that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> Opening a channel is a network round trip. So is closing a channel. If that&#8217;s acceptable to you,
</I>&gt;<i> opening and closing a channel per request is fine. Channels should not be shared
</I>&gt;<i> across threads.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For Web apps, a single connection and channel is usually sufficient, although
</I>&gt;<i> in Java and .NET you need to understand how your framework dispatches requests
</I>&gt;<i> in order to avoid concurrent publishes on a shared channel. Thread locals
</I>&gt;<i> should work OK, especially if you can pre-initialise all channels.
</I>I expect the message publishing activity to be low enough in the first 
implementation that I'll create a global synchronized publisher for the 
web app. I could always add more channels later if it becomes a bottleneck.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) My tests seem to show that when a subscribed consumer throws
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exception in handleDelivery(), it consumes the rest of its buffered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages and is then terminated.
</I>&gt;<i> That&#8217;s not correct. You likely use automatic acknowledgements and/or a
</I>&gt;<i> QueueingConsumer which accumulates all deliveries locally in a java.util.concurrent
</I>&gt;<i> queue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See tutorial 2:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-java.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-java.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does that mean I should never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> throw
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from handleDelivery()? Or should I monitor currently active
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consumers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and restart the failed ones?
</I>&gt;<i> Unhandled exceptions will be delegated to ExceptionHandler which
</I>&gt;<i> is configured per channel. If you use manual acknowledgements,
</I>&gt;<i> throwing exceptions in handleDelivery without acking or rejecting
</I>&gt;<i> a delivery is not a very good idea: RabbitMQ will think that the
</I>&gt;<i> delivery is still being processed, and will keep the message around.
</I>Thanks for the insight. I'll dig into this more. I was using manual acks 
and extending DefaultConsumer so I must have gotten something else wrong.

Regards,
Bertrand
