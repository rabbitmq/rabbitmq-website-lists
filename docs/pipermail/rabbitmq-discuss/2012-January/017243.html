I does seem like a very long time. Can you confirm that this is
happening on a single node (no clustering), clients are not using
auto-ack, and QoS prefetching is set to 2?

I understand that after all the message counts have reached 0, and
publishers stopped publishing you see a positive delivery rate for 10
minutes.

What is the delivery rate you see during the 10 minutes?
I assume publishers are connected during the 10 minutes - are any of
them perhaps publishing at a low rate?

&gt;<i> I understand that the message is always delivered from RAM.  But if
</I>&gt;<i> the message was on disk, it has to be pulled from there and put into

</I>&gt;<i> not the counts displayed reflected messages that were on disk as well

</I>
Whether a message was not on disk, on disk as well as RAM, or spent time
only on disk (removed from RAM and then reloaded later) is not directly
reflected in any of the management console statistics.
