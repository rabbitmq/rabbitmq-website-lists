<PRE>Hi Simone,

Most helpful. :)

Thank you much.

Hello again,

I&#8217;m working my way through several recovery scenarios. I think we&#8217;ve established the following:


a.       If broker bounces, durable messages in the durable queue that have been consumed &#8211; but not acked &#8211; will be redelivered.

b.      Such redelivered messages will have the &#8220;redelivered&#8221; flag set.

c.       If consumer bounces, both (a) and (b) still hold.

In re (a): is redelivery accomplished by placing another copy of the message in the queue (thus, two copies of same message are in the  queue &#8211; one consumed but not acked, the other brand new); OR does the broker simply know that it&#8217;s OK to redeliver the original message?

In re (b): the redelivered flag seems to enable the creation of what Hohpe calls an &#8220;idempotent receiver.&#8221; That is, the consumer can use this flag to decide how to dispose of the redelivered message. Consider a scenario wherein the consumers, all pulling from a single queue, dispatch the work to a lower layer service. If there are multiple consumer nodes (even multiple consumer threads), they will need some means of coordinating the disposition of the redelivered message. For example, NodeA consumes (but doesn&#8217;t ack) message 1. But it does dispatch the work represented by message 1 to a lower layer service. If the broker bounces and message 1 is redelivered, it might be consumed by NodeB. But the message 1 task is already in-flight on NodeA. So, depending on both the idempotency of the task and application specific functionality, NodeB might want to discard the redelivered message 1. Such intra-consumer/intra-consumer node coordination suggests that the first consumer of the message needs to record something, probably in the persistence layer, that says &#8220;I&#8217;ve started this particular task (using a unique request ID). Does this seem right?

Yes, according to my experience message deduplication is something that you need to carry out at the application level as it depends on how you consume your messages within your application. The broker is only able to make sure that messages reached a consumer in the application, what the application does with the messages is completely up to the application itself.


In re (c): does redelivery after consumer bounce work because the broker detects the loss of connection?

That's just one of the scenarios in which messages are redelivered. Take this with a grain of salt as I'm not completely sure of all the cases in which this happens with these exact semantics but in general whenever messages are not acked and, loosely speaking, a consumer goes away and a new one comes on the same queue, those messages will be redelivered.

Off the top of my mind:

 *   connection consumer-broker bounces
 *   broker bounces (with durable ex and queues and persistent messages)
 *   consumer is cancelled and another basic consume is issued
 *   consumer channel is closed an another channel with a new consumer on the same queue is created
 *   consumer issues a recover command to the broker
 *   consumer rejects or nacks messages with requeue flag



Please confirm, clarify, or correct as you see fit!

Thanks for your help.

Also in case 2 the broker will redeliver all messages that were not acked, although it doesn't necessarily mean that the consumer didn't really consume them already. For that you should look at the redelivered flag.

I apologize. I should have stated up front that the queues and messages are durable.

What happens in case 2, where the consumer bounces?

Thanks, Jason.

Hi Paul,

If the messages were published with the durable flag and the queues are durable, the messages will survive the broker restart and be re-presented to consumers. If the messages or the queues were not durable they will disappear after restart.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose I have a producer on NodeP, a broker on NodeB, and a consumer on NodeC. Suppose further that explicit acks are required (i.e., if I've understood the docs, that &quot;noack&quot; is not in effect) and that after consuming a message from the queue, NodeC.consumer dispatches some other work in order to process that message. IOW: NodeC.consumer doesn't respond immediately with an ack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, from NodeB.broker's point of view, the message has been moved from the exchange to the queue, consumed, but not yet ack-ed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What will happen under these two scenarios:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. NodeB.broker bounces - when broker restarts what will he do with un-acked messages that have been delivered to queue and haven't been ack-ed; e.g., will these be again delivered to the queue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. NodeC.consumer bounces - when consumer restarts is there any way he can again consume the un-acked message, and begin again the work that this message represents? (I suppose that NodeB.broker might be implicated here because it might detect the loss of connection to the NodeC.consumer....).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I say &quot;bounces,&quot; I mean at a minimum that the application (broker, consumer) crashed and restarted. But I am also interested in the case where the node's OS is for whatever reason rebooted. Perhaps it looks no different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your help.
