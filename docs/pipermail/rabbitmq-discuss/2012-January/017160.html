<PRE>Hi, Jim:

It depends on your scenario.

You might want to federate across a WAN; you wouldn't cluster across one, since
the Erlang distribution mechanisms that clustering builds on don't tolerate
partitions and high latency well.

You'd cluster if your goal is to increase the total capacity of your broker,
bearing in mind that the maximum throughput possible through a single queue
won't get larger when you do so.

Federating or Shoveling between different clusters, as you describe, is an 
entirely reasonable thing to do in some circumstances.  Suppose, for example
that you want increased capacity over a single host broker, or mirrored queues,
or the like within each of two WAN-connected datacenters, but still wanted to
be able to pass some subset of your message traffic between the datacenters.

Best regards,
Jerry

Hi all,


Given a scenario where the entire environment is identical for
rabbitMQ (same servers, OS's , RMQ versions &#8230; etc) , would there ever
be a need to have the environment configured for using both
as a cluster, and as a federation ?
