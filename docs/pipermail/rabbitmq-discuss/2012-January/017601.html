Yes, I mentioned federation but in this context shovel is pretty much the
same thing, although perhaps a little lighter than federation. Going down
the route of several brokers, indeed, I see it becoming a pain quite soon.

Perhaps some guys of the dev team can shed some light given their greater
experience.

I never used it personally, but if you're going to require a central store
anyway you may consider some messaging solutions that come with the storage
itself, after all according to what you describe you would be leveraging
just a very small part of what RabbitMQ provides. For instance MS SQL
Server ships with a built-in message broker, I don't know how it works but
it may be worth investigating, and I'm sure other storages provide that as
well. Some googling of &quot;distributed work queues&quot; may turn up something
interesting too.

</I>&gt;<i> I keep coming back around to keeping as much intelligence as possible at
</I>&gt;<i> Central, and keeping the consumer side as lean as I can.
