Yes, support for per-queue message TTL was introduced in rabbit 2.2.0.

&gt;<i> If we're going to enable TTLs, is there a pressing need to upgrade or
</I>&gt;<i> can we stay on 2.5.1?
</I>
We would always recommend running the latest version. In this case you
do not need to upgrade specifically to get this feature.

&gt;<i> Is there anything special to note about them in a 2.5.1 cluster?
</I>
No. per-queue TTL is a queue-specific feature and queues exist only on a
single node in a 2.5.1 cluster.

&gt;<i> Do we need to turn on client qos, or will rabbit change its consumer
</I>&gt;<i> delivery rules on TTL'd messages?
</I>
You do not need to set QoS for messages to expire.

&gt;<i> Are there any recommended lower bounds on this value?
</I>
This depends on your usage and hardware performance characteristics. You
should test and validate in a comparable environment before deploying to
production.

A value larger than the average latency makes sense.

&gt;<i> What kind of effect should we expect message TTL to have on resource
</I>&gt;<i> requirements?
</I>
I would expect perhaps a small improvement since it is easier for the
broker to expire a message than to deliver.

&gt;<i> Will this significantly impact the memory footprint specifically?
</I>
The effect would be similar to a consumer that works at the combined
rate of the publishers.

&gt;<i> Anything special about TTL in the case where rabbit is already under
</I>&gt;<i> very high load?
</I>
