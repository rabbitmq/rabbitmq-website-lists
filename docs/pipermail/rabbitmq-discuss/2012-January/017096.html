<PRE>Hi and Happy New Year,

amqp gem 0.9.0.pre (&quot;beta&quot;) is released to rubygems.org [1]. This release is fully backwards compatible with 0.8.4 and
has two fixes:

 * :default_routing_key value is now respected by AMQP::Exchange#initialize and AMQP::Exchange#publish. This is a rarely used feature but we saw one project relying on it, so it is now supported again.
 * Automatic recovery mode [2] now works for publishers.

I believe the 2nd improvement alone is worth upgrading.
0.9.0 will be released after a few more backwards compatible beta releases but we encourage you to give it a try today.

Thank you and happy 2012.

2. <A HREF="http://rubyamqp.info/articles/error_handling/#automatic_recovery">http://rubyamqp.info/articles/error_handling/#automatic_recovery</A>

P.S.

I want to explain why there are 3 pre releases on rubygems.org. On January 1st rubygems.org had some issues that led me to believe pre1 wasn't published correctly, so I tried a couple more times throughout the day. Because re-publishing with the same version number is prohibited (and rightfully so), I had to bump versions.
It turns out all releases were successful, but indexing of gems (what makes `gem install` find the version you want) was several hours behind its regular schedule. By now it has caught up, which can be verified with

gem list -r --prerelease --versions amqp

So all 3 .pre releases are effectively the same but go ahead and run with 0.9.0.pre3.
