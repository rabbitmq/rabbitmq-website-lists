<PRE>Hi All,

We've been running a few brokers for quite some time now. About a month ago one of them pretty much maxed out the CPU of the machine it was running on and has maintained this high level ever since.

It's only ever using 20% (max) of the memory, not swapping, the load average of the machine is less than one and the service seems unaffected.

Is this something I shouldn't be concerned with, it's not really having to cope with too much at the moment, a couple of active VHOSTS, small handful of exchanges, and in general less than 200/sec messages to even the busiest of those.

I'm getting nagged by the ops guys due to it setting off notifications for the high CPU load, if it's expected or not something to worry about this I can just tell them to disable that notification (or at least ignore it).

Are there any ways (beyond rabbitmqctl and the web interface) to see what's going on and if there's trouble ahead?

Many thanks,

Chris
