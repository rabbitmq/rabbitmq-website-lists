</I>&gt;<i> Hi dns, I'll try to bring my own experience on the subject. When you
</I>&gt;<i> federate exchanges between brokers you are in the loose sense having the
</I>&gt;<i> downstream exchange acting as a consumer for the upstream exchange. I may
</I>&gt;<i> have misunderstood you but I think that having 8000 brokers rather 8000
</I>&gt;<i> remote consumers on the central broker doesn't solve the consistency
</I>&gt;<i> problem you are describing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's make an example with federated brokers on the happy path:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    1. One message is published on the upstream exchange and reaches the
</I>&gt;<i>    downstream exchange, and in turn the queue and then the consumer on the
</I>&gt;<i>    downstream broker
</I>&gt;<i>    2. The downstream broker confirms the message to the upstream broker so
</I>&gt;<i>    the upstream broker can forget about it
</I>&gt;<i>    3. The connection between the brokers goes down
</I>&gt;<i>    4. The consumer on the downstream broker processes the message,
</I>&gt;<i>    acknowledges it and everyone's happy
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the sad path with federated brokers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    1. same as above
</I>&gt;<i>    2. The connection between the brokers is lost before the downstream can
</I>&gt;<i>    confirm the message to the upstream (unlikely, but can definitely
</I>&gt;<i> happen)
</I>&gt;<i>    3. The consumer on the downstream broker processes the message and
</I>&gt;<i>    acknowledges it to its local broker
</I>&gt;<i>    4. The connection between the two brokers is restored, and thus the
</I>&gt;<i>    upstream will resend the unconfirmed messages once again
</I>&gt;<i>    5. The consumer on the downstream will receive the same message it has
</I>&gt;<i>    already consumed, therefore it will need a way to deduplicate it
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now the safe path with just the central broker:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    1. One message is published on the central broker and reaches a remote
</I>&gt;<i>    consumers
</I>&gt;<i>    2. The consumer processes the message but the connection to the central
</I>&gt;<i>    broker will go down before it can ack the message
</I>&gt;<i>    3. Once the connection is restored the consumer will receive the
</I>&gt;<i> unacked
</I>&gt;<i>    message again, so also in this case it will need to deduplicate it
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some observations:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    - in any case your consumer will need to be somewhat aware of the fact
</I>&gt;<i>    that it is quite distant from the original broker and cope with what
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i>    implies in some way (message duplication, for one)
</I>&gt;<i>    - with the central broker the remote consumers will have to handle
</I>&gt;<i>    connection failures themselves, something which is less likely to
</I>&gt;<i> happen
</I>&gt;<i>    with a local broker, although not impossible of course. This is handled
</I>&gt;<i> by
</I>&gt;<i>    the federation plugin in case of federated brokers instead
</I>&gt;<i>    - Having 8000 brokers rather than 8000 consumers is going to require
</I>&gt;<i>    quite some maintenance, and I'm not sure how well the federation plugin
</I>&gt;<i>    RabbitMQ can handle that, I am under the impression that it was not
</I>&gt;<i>    designed for this many federated exchanges, but I may be wrong
</I>&gt;<i>    - You mention synchronicity between the central location and the remote
</I>&gt;<i>    consumers. Consider that even if you federate brokers and you see all
</I>&gt;<i>    messages delivered and acked on the federation queues, it doesn't tell
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i>    anything about whether the remote consumers have processed the messages
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i>    not
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thank you for all this. If I were inclined to use central and remote
exchanges/brokers, then SHOVEL is the missing piece I have been looking for.
However ... oh, the overhead with maintaining it all !

I suppose I am inclined to go with a Central Broker and have remote
consumers, and was wondering if someone might convince me otherwise.
However, this has not yet happened. 

Seeing as how my application is more of a &quot;task distribution and management
system&quot; where all sites are processing the same tasks (with RabbitMQ making
sure that the tasks are received), it has occurred to me that I might want a
database component at the central data center as well. I am working on a
conceptual workflow to flush this idea out.

I keep coming back around to keeping as much intelligence as possible at
Central, and keeping the consumer side as lean as I can. 

Thoughts ?
