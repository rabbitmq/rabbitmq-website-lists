I assume that the memory alarm had gone off, since the management UI
was reporting 3.9 GB over a 1.5 GB watermark. The UI also correctly
colored the background box as bright red :-)

&gt;<i> Also, the management plugin should in general be more responsive than
</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmqctl in heavily-loaded situations. This is because rabbitmqctl will
</I>&gt;<i> go and interrogate each {queue / connection / channel} in turn, while
</I>&gt;<i> management caches updates that are broadcast by these objects.
</I>
So it turns out the UI was effectively unresponsive - each _refresh_
would take a couple of minutes and the JS app would periodically crash
in Chrome (don't know about Mozilla).

The way I ended solving the issue was the with realization that 3
client instances had each leaked ca. 50K channels. After killing these
connections with rabbitmqctl (which took about 1 minute per
connection), the broker returned to a normal operating state. So in
the end, no other client connections needed to get terminated.

So all that was required was a bit of patience - thanks for taking the
time to look into this though.

Cheers,

Ben
