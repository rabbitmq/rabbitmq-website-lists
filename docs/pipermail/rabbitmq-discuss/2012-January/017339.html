<PRE>Michael and Alvaro,

Thank you both. That's good news.

Please let me follow-up with some finer grained aspects:

Am I right to think that the &quot;one producer, one queue, many consumers on different computers&quot; model would allow &quot;even&quot; distribution of messages? I don't want each message duplicated for each consumer. Rather, the fan-out should partition the entire message set with each consumer getting a subset thereof.

When a consumer pulls a message from the queue, is there a way to leave that message in queue? If so, can queue elements be updated in-place, e.g., with &quot;status&quot; info about the state of the work that the message (task) represents?

Thanks again.

-Paul

Yes, many clients is what RabbitMQ is designed for. The queue is hosted
at the server and the clients interact with it over the network.
