<PRE>Hi Paul,

If the messages were published with the durable flag and the queues are durable, the messages will survive the broker restart and be re-presented to consumers. If the messages or the queues were not durable they will disappear after restart.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose I have a producer on NodeP, a broker on NodeB, and a consumer on NodeC. Suppose further that explicit acks are required (i.e., if I've understood the docs, that &quot;noack&quot; is not in effect) and that after consuming a message from the queue, NodeC.consumer dispatches some other work in order to process that message. IOW: NodeC.consumer doesn't respond immediately with an ack.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, from NodeB.broker's point of view, the message has been moved from the exchange to the queue, consumed, but not yet ack-ed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What will happen under these two scenarios:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. NodeB.broker bounces - when broker restarts what will he do with un-acked messages that have been delivered to queue and haven't been ack-ed; e.g., will these be again delivered to the queue?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. NodeC.consumer bounces - when consumer restarts is there any way he can again consume the un-acked message, and begin again the work that this message represents? (I suppose that NodeB.broker might be implicated here because it might detect the loss of connection to the NodeC.consumer....).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I say &quot;bounces,&quot; I mean at a minimum that the application (broker, consumer) crashed and restarted. But I am also interested in the case where the node's OS is for whatever reason rebooted. Perhaps it looks no different.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your help.
