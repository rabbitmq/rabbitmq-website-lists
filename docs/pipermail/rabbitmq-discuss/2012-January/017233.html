<PRE>Hi Ciprian,


    I've also pondered about the same topic a while ago... (Though I
&gt;<i> haven't tried it in practice.) As such my options were the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    a) (the easiest one) Go with the choreography approach, but
</I>&gt;<i> instead of naming the queue of the next service (and send to a direct
</I>&gt;<i> exchange), just send it to an exchange named by the next step's
</I>&gt;<i> purpose (like &quot;enrich&quot;, &quot;validate&quot;, etc.). Maybe make this a topic
</I>&gt;<i> exchange and put enough information in the routing key to allow
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;debugging&quot; by being able to register another queue and &quot;capture&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> traffic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, I agree with you, send to a exchange is more apropriate


&gt;<i>    b) (the &quot;declarative&quot; approach) Why not have the orchestration
</I>&gt;<i> approach (in a declarative flavor) combined with choreography:
</I>&gt;<i>    * let's assume that you have a task which goes through a set of
</I>&gt;<i> processes (transformations or just validations, etc.) which can be
</I>&gt;<i> described as decision tree (a binary tree of actions, where each node
</I>&gt;<i> is a process and the two children (one for success and one for
</I>&gt;<i> failure) are the next process to be executed);
</I>&gt;<i>    * now you just put this decision tree inside the &quot;envelope&quot; of
</I>&gt;<i> each message, send it to the root process;
</I>&gt;<i>    * this process executes its logic and based on the outcome
</I>&gt;<i> (success or failure), extracts one of it's subtrees, puts that in the
</I>&gt;<i> new envelope and together with the new message sends it to the root of
</I>&gt;<i> the new tree; (evidently at some point the new tree would be empty,
</I>&gt;<i> which means it should stop sending it further;)
</I>&gt;<i>    * (you could again use &quot;purpose&quot; names for exchanges instead of
</I>&gt;<i> direct queues;)
</I>&gt;<i>    * you could extend this to a graph (maybe containing cycles, thus
</I>&gt;<i> obtaining loops), by saying that each node has two links to other
</I>&gt;<i> nodes;
</I>&gt;<i>    * of course yet another extension would be to allow &quot;labeled&quot; node
</I>&gt;<i> links, i.e. each process outputs two things: a next-step string label,
</I>&gt;<i> and the new message, and now you select from the labeled links the one
</I>&gt;<i> matching the label; (maybe have something as a default link);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Thus with option b) you obtain both the advantages of choreography
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. no middle man to become a single point of failure or
</I>&gt;<i> bottleneck), but also the advantages of orchestration (i.e. each
</I>&gt;<i> message having it's own &quot;route&quot; through the processes). At the same
</I>&gt;<i> time you keep the processors &quot;dumb&quot;, none knowing of another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Very interesting this approach, and better the possibility to eliminate a
possible SPOF.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Hope this helps.
</I>&gt;<i>    Ciprian.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    P.S.: If you like this approach (b), you could go even further and
</I>&gt;<i> instead of using a static decision tree (or graph) you could
</I>&gt;<i> substitute that with an embedded language or machine which allows
</I>&gt;<i> generic operations on both the old and new message to decide the next
</I>&gt;<i> actions. (I could expand on this if someone is interested.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that (b) approach can be more flexible for large and complex
</I>process and it sounds good.

Maybe this topic can generate good discussions and patterns for complex
process management.

Best regards




&gt;<i>    A practical (not very elegant) Java approach:
</I>&gt;<i>    * define a Java interface with a method like `public AmqpTarget
</I>&gt;<i> decide (MyMessage old, MyMessage new)` (or something similar), where
</I>&gt;<i> `AmqpTarget` has two fields for exchange and routing key;
</I>&gt;<i>    a) if all the processes share the same code and are upgraded at
</I>&gt;<i> the same time, just instantiate a serializable object implementing
</I>&gt;<i> that interface and put that in the envelope instead of the decision
</I>&gt;<i> tree;
</I>&gt;<i>    b) if you don't have shared code or you want to keep your options
</I>&gt;<i> opened:
</I>&gt;<i>    * for each different &quot;workflow&quot; define a new public &quot;top&quot; class
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. not nested or anonymous) implementing that interface with as few
</I>&gt;<i> dependencies as possible;
</I>&gt;<i>    * in the envelope instead of the decision tree put the byte-code
</I>&gt;<i> of this class (you can use the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> `MyWorkflowClass.class.getResourceStream(MyWorkflowClass.class.getCanonicalName())`
</I>&gt;<i> and the canonical name; (be careful to use caching or you'll get
</I>&gt;<i> `PermGenError` or similar;)
</I>&gt;<i>    * to instantiate the class on the receiver just create a custom
</I>&gt;<i> classloader which when asked for the bytecode of that known class just
</I>&gt;<i> returns the bytes previously stored;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
