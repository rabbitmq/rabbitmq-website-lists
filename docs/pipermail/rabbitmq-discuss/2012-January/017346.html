It appears that you stunned everyone into silence ;-)

How are you getting on with this?

&gt;<i> I've been working on a c++ wrapper around rabbitmq-c that presents a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;humane&quot; API to the programmer heavily inspired by the Puka project.
</I>&gt;<i> (see:&#160;<A HREF="https://github.com/alanxz/SimpleAmqpClient">https://github.com/alanxz/SimpleAmqpClient</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In developing this library I've run across several limitations of the
</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmq-c when working with multiple channels, the biggest issue being:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - There is no way to wait for a list of methods on a channel.
</I>&gt;<i> There is amqp_simple_wait_method() - however this suffers from some serious
</I>&gt;<i> drawbacks:
</I>&gt;<i> + you can only specify one method to listen for
</I>&gt;<i> + it calls abort() if a different method, or a method on a different channel
</I>&gt;<i> is received
</I>&gt;<i> A use case for this might be: doing a basic.publish, and you want to want to
</I>&gt;<i> wait for a basic.ack or a basic.return on a channel with confirms enabled
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way I got around this in SimpleAmqpClient was to only use
</I>&gt;<i> amqp_simple_wait_frame() and maintain queues of amqp_frame_t for each
</I>&gt;<i> channel that I have open.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, this comes with one serious drawback: memory management. Each
</I>&gt;<i> decoded frame is allocated in a connection-wide amqp_pool_t. &#160;Because of
</I>&gt;<i> this - it is impossible to recycle the pool and release memory unless you
</I>&gt;<i> have dealt with all of your pending amqp_frame_t's. &#160;This becomes a problem
</I>&gt;<i> in&#160;pathological&#160;cases where you have two consumers sending simultaneously,
</I>&gt;<i> you can get in the situation that even though the client program eventually
</I>&gt;<i> deals with every consumed message, memory never gets released, because there
</I>&gt;<i> is always at least one frame queued up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above demonstrates the second biggest issue with the rabbitmq-c API:
</I>&gt;<i> memory management when dealing with multiple channels. &#160;There is no way to
</I>&gt;<i> separate out memory allocation on, for example, a per-channel basis (with
</I>&gt;<i> the library client keeping track of the memory pools used for example).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before I go on I'd like to mention one feature that I find useful with the
</I>&gt;<i> current API: it is possible to use something like select() before calling
</I>&gt;<i> amqp_simple_wait_frame() to setup a timeout while waiting for a consumer,
</I>&gt;<i> which is useful when developing single-threaded RPC apps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So now the interesting part: how could the API be improved?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some thoughts I've had dealing with the memory management:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Create a amqp_simple_wait_frame() variant that as one of the parameters
</I>&gt;<i> provides a callback to allocate memory, either something like a malloc()
</I>&gt;<i> call, which the client would then be responsible for freeing, or perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> something like get_amqp_pool(amqp_frame_t) which allows the client to return
</I>&gt;<i> a memory pool which rabbitmq-c would use to allocate memory for that frame.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;The amqp_frame_t would have to have some minimal amount of information
</I>&gt;<i> filled in - such as frame type and channel to be useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. amqp_channel_t becomes a struct containing both the the channel_id and a
</I>&gt;<i> amqp_pool_t. &#160;The amqp_pool would be used by the library to allocate frames
</I>&gt;<i> received on that channel. &#160;The client would then be responsible for calling
</I>&gt;<i> amqp_pool_recycle at an appropriate point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some thoughts on improving the API to deal with multiple channels:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Add the following to the API:
</I>&gt;<i> amqp_simple_wait_frame_on_channel - wait for a frame on a specified channel
</I>&gt;<i> amqp_simple_wait_methods - wait for multiple methods on a specified channel.
</I>&gt;<i> Don't abort() if the wrong method, or channel is received, instead queue up
</I>&gt;<i> the frame as is done in amqp_simple_rpc
</I>&gt;<i> amqp_frames_enqueued_for_channel to add feature parity with
</I>&gt;<i> amqp_frames_enqueued
</I>&gt;<i> I started to code this up at one point but abandoned it as it didn't support
</I>&gt;<i> the interesting property of being able to use select() to specify a timeout
</I>&gt;<i> when calling amqp_simple_wait_frame_on_channel. &#160;At least not without adding
</I>&gt;<i> timeout to the rabbitmq-c api, which didn't fit with how the current
</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmq-c api. Here's the implementation I came up with before I abandoned
</I>&gt;<i> it. I can't guarantee is completely free of
</I>&gt;<i> bugs.&#160;<A HREF="https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c/commits/simple_wait_frame/">https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c/commits/simple_wait_frame/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Continue to duck the issue and allow clients to write their own code to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with multiple channels (fixing the memory management issue using one of
</I>&gt;<i> the above techniques)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Something I haven't thought of yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So anyone have any thoughts on all of this?
</I>&gt;<i>
