Hi Josh,

Keep in mind that when binding a queue to a consistent hash exchange you
don't bind with a topic. You bind with a number that indicates what
share of messages the queue will receive. Those messages can have any
routing key. If you want workers to handle only particular topics then
you should use a topic exchange.

&gt;<i> Particularly, if a new worker enters and creates some topics on the

</I>&gt;<i> message to operate on that data is sent to a new topic, we could have

</I>
For the consistent hash exchange some keys will be unavoidably be
remapped when the bindings change. The advantage is that not all keys
need to be remapped. If your workers can only deal with one or a limited
number of topics then you should not be using a consistent hash exchange.
