<PRE>Thank you, Alvaro.

I had assumed (but Michael corrected me) that once a consumer retrieved a message, that message would disappear from the queue. Can you point me to examples/docs that show how to 1) cause a message to persist despite its retrieval by a consumer; 2) how explicitly to delete such a persisted message from a queue?

-Paul

PS: looking forward to your book. Any chance Amazon will have it before March?

Hi,

RE - Keeping messages:

RabbitMQ takes care of queueing messages, that is, of keeping them in queues. The only thing you have to do as a user is publishing them.

RE - Deleting messages:

When the message is delivered to a consumer and then that messages is asked back to the server, then the message is automatically deleted by RabbitMQ (this is an oversimplification BTW, there are many options that might modify message durability).

Regards,

Alvaro

Michael,

Thanks for the reply.

I have finished working through a few of the tutorials you referenced. Either I missed something or haven't yet gotten to the right tutorial.

You've told me that it's possible to leave a message in a queue, i.e., that a message can persist in its queue even after it has been received by a consumer. Can you tell me how this is done?

Also, such an approach suggests the need to explicitly delete the message from the queue. Is there a way to do this?

Cordially,

Paul

&gt;<i>No. You can leave it in the queue, but you can't change it. You'd have to post another message.
