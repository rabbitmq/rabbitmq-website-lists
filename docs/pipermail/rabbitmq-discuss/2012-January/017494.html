<PRE>Michael,

Thanks for the reply.

I have finished working through a few of the tutorials you referenced. Either I missed something or haven't yet gotten to the right tutorial.

You've told me that it's possible to leave a message in a queue, i.e., that a message can persist in its queue even after it has been received by a consumer. Can you tell me how this is done?

Also, such an approach suggests the need to explicitly delete the message from the queue. Is there a way to do this?

Cordially,

Paul

&gt;<i>Paul,

&gt;<i>Looking through the tutorials will obviate many further questions.
</I>
&gt;<i>On this specifically,
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> When a consumer pulls a message from the queue, is there a way to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leave that message in queue? If so, can queue elements be updated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in-place, e.g., with &quot;status&quot; info about the state of the work that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the message (task) represents?
</I>
&gt;<i>No. You can leave it in the queue, but you can't change it. You'd have to post another message.
