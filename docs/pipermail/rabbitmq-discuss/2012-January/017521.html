Take a look at our recent project - SockJS:
   <A HREF="https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client">https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client</A>

You would still need to write a bridge between RabbitMQ and SockJS,
but I personally think it's desired, and gives you more flexibility in the
future.

&gt;<i> This also leads me to my next question. What is the upper bound of unique
</I>&gt;<i> queues one RabittMQ machine can reasonably manage. I know its hardware
</I>&gt;<i> dependent but can someone throw out a ballpark figure... hundreds,

</I>
RabbitMQ is surprisingly good at handling large number of relatively unused
queues. But if you want to keep them busy and push messages often -
well, that's another story. I think you should expect that a single rabbitmq
box should be able to output around 30k msg/sec. Probably less with
a large number of active queues. But this really depends very much
on your access patterns.

Hope that helps!
