<PRE>Hi,

In the RabbitMQ documentation there is a mention about how the management plugin works in a cluster, and from what I understand these are the main points:

1.       The management plugin can be installed on one or more nodes in the cluster

2.       Cluster nodes which do not have full management plugin will need to have an management-agent plugin installed on them

3.       The management plugin installs a database into RabbitMQ. In a RabbitMQ cluster there will be only one copy of the statistics database located in the first node to come up that has full management plugin installed. If that node goes down then statistics information will be missing.

My question is: Isn't there any other way by which we can make the statistics database highly available? Because our requirement is that, we would like to review the statistics on a monthly basis, but in case the lone node goes down within that period, we lose all the information.

Thanks and regards,
Mridu
