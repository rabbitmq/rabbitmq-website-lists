<PRE>Does 10 minutes sounds like a valid delay period?  Seems like an
awfully long time to me.

I understand that the message is always delivered from RAM.  But if
the message was on disk, it has to be pulled from there and put into
RAM to be delivered.  My question was really more around whether or
not the counts displayed reflected messages that were on disk as well
as those that might be in RAM?

Thanks
Andy
