Unless you need wildcards you may not even need a topic exchange. *If* 
routing turns out to be an expensive thing for you then a direct 
exchange can give a notable performance boost.

&gt;<i> My question is how expensive is routing?
</I>
Depends :) If you're sending lots of small non-persistent messages fast 
then it can become a somewhat significant factor, just because RabbitMQ 
isn't doing mush *else* per message.

Usually making routing simpler will make it faster.

&gt;<i> Also, regarding the routing,

</I>&gt;<i> users or to distribute users across multiple topic exchanges or does
</I>&gt;<i> it not matter?
</I>
It doesn't matter.

&gt;<i> I assume rabbitmq first looks up the exchange and then goes through

</I>&gt;<i> case, I imagine it would be more performant to create a thousand such

</I>&gt;<i> topic exchange for all users.
</I>
No, it's not quite like that - topic routing is O(log(n)). But I think 
the n there is the total number of topic bindings, not per exchange.

&gt;<i> In the end, I plan to run several rabbitmq nodes with a bucket of
</I>&gt;<i> users assigned to each rabbit node. Assigning each user to a node
</I>&gt;<i> based on a hash. Is this best practice for scaling rabbitmq for this
</I>&gt;<i> type of scenerio? Currently rabbitmq is the bottle neck in my
</I>&gt;<i> application benchmarks so this was my plan to scale it. Please correct
</I>&gt;<i> me if there is a better practice.
</I>
This sort of sharding is probably the most scalable solution if it's 
practical. If it's not practical then clustering or federation would be 
alternative routes...

Cheers, Simon
