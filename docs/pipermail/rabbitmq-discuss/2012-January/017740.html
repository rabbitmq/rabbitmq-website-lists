<PRE>Hi Paul,

&gt;<i> Is there any in-built support for encrypting/decrypting the at-rest messages in the queue? I suppose that producer could encrypt and consumer decrypt. But I was hoping to avoid a &quot;roll your own&quot; approach.
</I>
No, there isn't any in-built RabbitMQ feature to encrypt at-rest
messages.  You'll have to roll your own.  As a rule, RabbitMQ does *not*
modify (or inspect) the contents of received messages.

If you use SSL on both the producer and consumer sides, the only way for
an attacker to get the messages would be to gain access to machine
hosting RabbitMQ or to the network the RabbitMQ cluster is running on
(if there is a cluster).

So, are you planning against an attacker who has gotten his hands on an
offline machine with RabbitMQ on it?  I haven't tried, but I suppose you
could use an encrypted file system.  RabbitMQ stores messages and state
only in its mnesia database directory, so if you encrypt that, you
should be secure.

&gt;<i> I am trying to think about a rogue producer injecting meaningful messages into the queue, i.e., a message whose processing might return a valuable data resource. Then there's also the need to prevent someone from inspecting the queue with an eye to reverse-engineering message syntax.
</I>
I'm not quite sure I follow.  Could you elaborate?

Cheers,
Alex
