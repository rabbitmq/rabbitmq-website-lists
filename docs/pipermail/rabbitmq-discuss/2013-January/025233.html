<PRE>To RabbitMQ gurus - Could you please post the replies here instead of just 
replying to the original person (Roman in this case). This is something of 
interest to me as well and I would like to follow this thread. Thx!

</I>&gt;<i> Balancer in front of them, increased all of the system limits on sockets 
</I>&gt;<i> and file descriptors, but can't seem to scale to more then 30k connections 
</I>&gt;<i> on the entire cluster. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each connections has it's own exchange and a temporary direct queue, RAM 
</I>&gt;<i> usage is about 2-3GB on each node and CPU usage peaks at about 200% (which 
</I>&gt;<i> on 4 cores isn't all that bad). At first all is quite well and the cluster 
</I>&gt;<i> manages upwards of 1k msgs/second (I haven't tried more, pretty sure it 
</I>&gt;<i> would handle it). However, after scaling to that many connections, the 
</I>&gt;<i> cluster seems to grind to a halt and eventually nodes become unresponsive. 
</I>&gt;<i> The management API takes upwards of 5 (FIVE!) minutes to retrieve a server 
</I>&gt;<i> summary report. Am I missing something here? Or is this just a bad idea 
</I>&gt;<i> altogether? I was expecting that if each node was able to handle 30k+ 
</I>&gt;<i> connections, I could have a cluster of 50 or so (with multiple balancers, 
</I>&gt;<i> of course!) and live a happy life  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
