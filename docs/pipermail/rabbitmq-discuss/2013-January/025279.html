For the record, your picture was very small and I couldn't read the 
text. But I know what that screen is supposed to look like.

However, to add to what people have already said:

* &quot;deliver&quot; refers to messages delivered as a result of basic.consume. * 
&quot;get&quot; refers to messages that arrived in response to basic.get.
* &quot;deliver / get&quot; is the sum of both.
* &quot;ack&quot; just shows the ack rate, if messages are delivered with autoack 
then this rate can be lower or zero.

However, the thing that everyone else missed :-) is that under 
&quot;deliver/get&quot; there is the text &quot;(of which redelivered)&quot;. That's what 
the second figure in the cell is - it's showing the number of messages 
sent via deliver / get which have the redelivered flag set.

Messages with &quot;redelivered&quot; set may have already been delivered to a 
consumer once. Messages will be redelivered if the consumer dies or 
invokes basic.recover before acknowledging them, or if the consumer 
rejects / nacks them. (Or after HA failover, but I doubt that is what is 
happening.)

High rates of redelivery usually indicate unhealthy consumers - you 
should definitely investigate why so many messages are being redelivered!

&gt;<i> can see that the rate of deliver is 626 but the ack  is only 1.4/s
</I>&gt;<i> so Could you tell me the reason and the difference between deliver and get?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://rabbitmq.1065348.n5.nabble.com/file/n24797/11.jpg">http://rabbitmq.1065348.n5.nabble.com/file/n24797/11.jpg</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the picture ,there is only one value and the rate of deliver equals the
</I>&gt;<i> ack.why?
</I>
Nothing is being redelivered in that case. If no messages are being 
redelivered the management web UI just hides everything to do with 
redelivery.

Cheers, Simon
