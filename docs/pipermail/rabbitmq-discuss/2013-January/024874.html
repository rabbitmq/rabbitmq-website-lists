If the manager knows how many responses to expect then a possible
solution would be for the manager to populate the &quot;reply-to&quot; property in
the request message and have replies sent to this queue. The manager can
take action as soon as all replies are received.

If the manager does not know how many replies to expect then the problem
becomes alot harder. It becomes tricky to distinguish between a consumer
crashing and a message taking very long to process. You may need to
tolerate the presence of timeouts.

Two-way communication is the easiest way to solve this problem. Can you
explain your reluctance to avoid RPC?
