<PRE>Simon,

Thanks for your reply. Here is an example of our use case based on your topology:

X is bound to CHX1 with &quot;MessageTypeA.Something.#&quot; and &quot;MessageTypeB.SomethingElse.#&quot;

P publishes message M1 with routing key: &quot;MessageTypeA.Something.&lt;HashMe&gt;&quot;  - This is delivered to Exchange CHX1
P then publishes another message M2 with a different routing key:  &quot;MessageTypeB.SomethingElse.&lt;HashMe&gt;&quot;  - This is delivered to Exchange CHX1

&lt;HashMe&gt; from message M1 is the same as &lt;HashMe&gt; from message M2 and should be delivered to the same queue say Q1 as they must be consumed by the same consumer.

The way the Consistent Hash Exchange seems to work is that it takes the entire routing key and hashes that. Is there a way to make it use a segment of the routing key?

Cheers

Matt

So some of this comes down to &quot;it depends what you want to do&quot;. If you are doing some routing based on the routing key (before?) the messages hit the CHX then you presumably are using e2e bindings like so:

                 /&gt; Q1
          &gt; CHX1 -&gt; Q2
         /       \&gt; Q3
        /        /&gt; Q4
P -&gt; X --&gt; CHX2 -&gt; Q5
        \        \&gt; Q6
         \       /&gt; Q7
          &gt; CHX3 -&gt; Q8
                 \&gt; Q9

with routing for message type at X and then load balancing at CHX{1,2,3}.

So if the X in question is a topic exchange then option i) should work fine in the scenario above. Putting the hash at either end is fine, the key becomes a tree structure for routing anyway.

I don't know what exchange type you are currently using although I guess topic; if you are using a direct exchange you would either have to switch to topic or change your publishers to publish to one of several CHXs rather than to one DX with one of several routing keys.

Options ii) and iii) struggle with the fact that the CHX doesn't currently support hashing on anything other than the routing key.

Cheers, Simon
