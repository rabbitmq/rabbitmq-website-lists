<PRE>Pika 0.9.9 is purely a bugfix release addressing issues raised in 0.9.8 and has been uploaded to pypi.

The documentation has been updated with a few more examples and edits for clarification and can found at <A HREF="http://pika.readthedocs.org/">http://pika.readthedocs.org/</A>

Roadmap

0.9.10 is slated to re-introduce the Twisted adapter and will abstract out frame marshaling and demarshalling to the pamqp library. The goal is to use this library to provide an abstraction around the pure-python AMQP implementation while allowing for transparent use of librabbitmq for performance enhancements. Any future versions after 0.9.10 will be purely bug fix versions until 1.0 which will be used to signify a stable API with no intended backwards-incompatible changes.

I have begun the initial investigation of Python 3 support and believe that by implementing the use of the pamqp library in 0.9.10 it will make it much easier to port Pika to Python 3 without breakage.

As always, if you happen across any bugs, please report them at <A HREF="https://github.com/pika/pika/issues">https://github.com/pika/pika/issues</A>

Regards,

Gavin
