If you didn't receive a confirm for a message then there is no guarantee 
that the message has made to and been processed by the broker. That's 
the whole point of having confirms.

A correct AMQP connection closure handshake, which apps/clients should 
always perform, ensures that the messages have made it to the broker, 
but not that they have been processed. Under normal circumstances little 
can go wrong once the messages have been received by the broker, so a 
proper connection closure provides a pretty good guarantee. But the 
guarantee offered by confirms is stronger.

Regards,

Matthias.
