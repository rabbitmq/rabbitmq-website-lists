I think Matthias meant to disable management altogether. Elsewhere you 
mentioned that the management overview page was very slow; this is a 
known issue with large numbers of queues / connections (which we are 
working on) so don't take that as evidence of the cluster grinding to a 
halt. And management does have some per-object overheads of its own; it 
would be good to eliminate them.

So what goes wrong when you start this many connections? (and queues - I 
assume you still have one queue per connection?) Do you run out of 
memory, does CPU reach 100%? &quot;rabbitmqctl status&quot; can tell you more 
about where memory is going.

Cheers, Simon
