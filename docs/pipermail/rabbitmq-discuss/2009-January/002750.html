<PRE>&gt;<i> That's the standard last-value-cache scenario. Almost
</I>&gt;<i> everyone would benefit from that kind of functionality IMO.
</I>Yup, that's what I thought.

&gt;<i> However, it's pretty dangerous to use without the proper
</I>&gt;<i> caution.
</I>Absolutely.

&gt;<i> The number of topics is basically unbound (actually
</I>&gt;<i> 256^256) meaning that you can exhaust memory and cause DoS by
</I>&gt;<i> swapping to disk when application doesn't restrict itself to
</I>&gt;<i> a finite set of distinct topics.
</I>Yes, you do have to put controls in place to stop the server from becoming exhausted.

&gt;<i> Also, getting the last value
</I>&gt;<i> can be pretty CPU greedy if there's a lot of topics - that
</I>&gt;<i> can also lead to DoS situations.
</I>Indeed.
