<PRE>Hi Barry,

Just for the record, I think I agree that the defaults should be  
towards minimizing leftovers on the server unless specifically  
desired.  So I think that setting auto_delete = true and durable =  
false by default makes sense.  The sometimes unfortunate bit is that  
to get what I was expect for &quot;durable&quot; queues, I need to set both flag  
in the opposite.

My only question here I guess is a curiosity one - is there a use case  
for having an auto-deleting, but durable queue?  I did look through  
the spec again but didn't find something along these lines.

Sorry Ben, I agree I should have sent this directly to the list.  ;)

Thanks all,
Brian
