It's certainly a bug. The question is how to deal with it. I would 
expect to see some errors recorded in the logs (which RabbitMQ does), 
some admin to be informed, etc, etc, which indeed are all things outside 
the protocol spec. When it comes to raising protocol errors though, if 
the spec doesn't specify the precise conditions under which such errors 
are signalled then it's up to implementation choice.

</I>
Perhaps, but who should this condition be signalled to? I'd argue the 
*consumers* should be told about it. After all, the queue may vanish 
long after anyone has published a message to it. Conversely, if nobody 
ever tries to consume messages from the queue then the fact that it once 
existed and then vanished is of little interest to anybody.

I suppose one way to handle this inside the current spec would be to 
signal a channel error on all channels with subscribers to a queue that 
is dying an unexpected death. What do you reckon?


Matthias.
