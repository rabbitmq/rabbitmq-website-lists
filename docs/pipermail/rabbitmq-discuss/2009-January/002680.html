Brian:

IIRC as far as the py-amqplib defaults go...my thought was that if 
you're going to do something that makes a persistent change the server, 
such has having a queue that's durable, then I thought you should 
explicitly say so.  That way if you're just dabbling around or don't 
exactly know what you're doing, there's no permanent harm done.

Even if a case could be made that the defaults are not ideal, it's 
probably too late to change it now.  I supposed it could be addressed in 
documentation.

I agree that having the separate durable and auto_delete flags can be 
confusing, but that comes from the spec, and is just passed through by 
the client library - the broker is where the flags have an impact.
