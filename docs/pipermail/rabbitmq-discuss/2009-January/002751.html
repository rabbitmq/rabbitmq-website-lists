<PRE>Just my quick thoughts about functionality that may be needed:
1)      When declaring exchange, ability to specify the count of messages to hold (not only just last one)
2)      ability to specify expiration date or time span and hold messages to that date

What do you think?

Those both sound like useful extensions to the idea. I can see the first scenario quickly consuming resources, but if used correctly it has a lot of uses.
