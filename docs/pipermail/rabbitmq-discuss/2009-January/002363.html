Thanks for the info Ben. In that case I will try to use 1.5.

I think my misunderstanding is based on my expectation that a bug-fix  
release on top of 1.4 would be called something like 1.4.1, whereas  
1.5.beta would likely contain new features that may still be  
experimental. It may be worth making the above information a bit more  
explicit on the downloads page.

Also as Alexis mentioned, start thinking about dropping the beta tag.  
The &quot;perpetual beta&quot; is so 2008, even Google has mostly dropped the  
practice by now.

</I>
Hmm that's fair enough but it requires some knowledge of using Hg to  
get the long revision number. A page with some links would be a little  
more helpful.

Thanks,
Neil
