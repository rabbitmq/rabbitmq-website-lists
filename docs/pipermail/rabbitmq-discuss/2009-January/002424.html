<PRE>Can you tell us a bit more about the EC2 set up please - is there
anything unusual about how you built and connect to your AMIs?

</I>&gt;<i> We had an incident yesterday while restarting some servers where RabbitMQ
</I>&gt;<i> began basically being dysfunctional -- we were getting connection timeouts
</I>&gt;<i> in our log everywhere, and were not even able to perform a rabbitmqctl
</I>&gt;<i> list_queues without it timing out 70-80% of the time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's our setup. We have two RabbitMQ nodes running on EC2 running Ubuntu
</I>&gt;<i> hardy. They have four queues, all of them durable, each with &lt;1kb message
</I>&gt;<i> sizes. Yesterday we were doing a deployment so naturally these queues filled
</I>&gt;<i> up with backlog as the servers responsible for processing them were
</I>&gt;<i> temporarily turned off. We ran into a snag in the deployment, so this
</I>&gt;<i> downtime was extended, which resulted in the queues backlogging more than
</I>&gt;<i> we've had to do in the past.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the time of the incident, both nodes were displaying the same behavior,
</I>&gt;<i> though anecdotally it appeared that one node was slightly more responsive
</I>&gt;<i> than the other. list_queues was timing out and our consumers (once brought
</I>&gt;<i> back up) were throwing connection timeout errors left and right. We also
</I>&gt;<i> noticed that the consumer threads that did not timeout would in fact have to
</I>&gt;<i> wait 2-3 seconds on a synchronous call to get before receiving the next
</I>&gt;<i> message from the queue. We were pushing approximately 30-60 items per second
</I>&gt;<i> onto the 4 queues in total. At the time of the failures, the persister log
</I>&gt;<i> was around 25mb, and I was able to see using list_queues that the queue
</I>&gt;<i> sizes in total was approximately 50MB. RAM wise, rabbit was using
</I>&gt;<i> approximately 30-40MB on each machine and there were intermittent CPU spikes
</I>&gt;<i> but generally the CPU was largely idle. (Note that we initialize these
</I>&gt;<i> queues in a manner that we are sure they are distributed over the nodes
</I>&gt;<i> evenly, half the queues are 'owned' by node 1 and the other by node 2, so
</I>&gt;<i> the RAM usage makes sense.) Using iostat, the disk did not seem to be under
</I>&gt;<i> much load, and now that things are nominal it looks like the disk load is
</I>&gt;<i> the same as when things were broken (about 30 blk/s writes.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing to notice obviously is this isn't a very high workload, so we are
</I>&gt;<i> pretty perplexed why things basically died after our queue backed up for an
</I>&gt;<i> hour. We managed to fix the problem by basically purging the two larger
</I>&gt;<i> queues (after several attempts), and things basically snapped out of it.
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately for us the data on these queues didn't really need to be
</I>&gt;<i> retained, and we were able to salvage the data on the other two queues in
</I>&gt;<i> this case which is the real data we need durable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The rabbit.log didn't reveal anything useful, it just simply showed the
</I>&gt;<i> regular persister log rotating messages missed in with timeout errors such
</I>&gt;<i> as the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =WARNING REPORT==== 6-Jan-2009::02:20:42 ===
</I>&gt;<i> Non-AMQP exit reason '{timeout,
</I>&gt;<i>                          {gen_server,
</I>&gt;<i>                              call,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [&lt;8656.465.0&gt;,{basic_get,&lt;0.14214.1&gt;,false}]}}'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're obviously deeply concerned by this incident, particularly since
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ was nowhere near exhausting memory or I/O capacity and simply
</I>&gt;<i> seemed to be having internal contention issues or garbage collection issues
</I>&gt;<i> or something going on preventing it from being able to handle our light
</I>&gt;<i> workload once our consumers came back online. Any help you can give is
</I>&gt;<i> greatly appreciated!
