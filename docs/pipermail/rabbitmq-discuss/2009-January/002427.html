The bit that is confusing me is the intention of the transaction
(which I guess is the crux of this whole thread :-)

So going back to you paper based analogy, what is the logical unit of work?

Is it

a) send out n requests and if any error occurs, 0 requests get sent
because they are grouped in a transaction;
b) send out n requests and wait for every result to come back and then
if there is an error with any response, roll the whole thing back

?

The reason why I ask is because I can't see how (b) can work unless
you propagate the transactional context to all of the consumers of the
requests. But as I said before, I'm probably missing the point.

Ben
