<PRE>Is there a more appropriate venue for AMQP users to gather and puzzle  
out what's what?  I feel a lack of community around my attempts to  
puzzle out what design patterns are good, and what AMQP expects of me.

One thing I'm having trouble with is getting a clear model of how  
responsibility for a message moves around. Basic publish tosses  
responsibility, and it's - ah - later that you _might_ infer or be  
told that it didn't work out.

That is the point of &quot;2.2.3  No Confirmations&quot; in &quot;Advanced Message  
Queuing Protocol Specification [0.8 June 2006]&quot;.

indeed ... great list!

&gt;<i> There are two types of errors that can

</I>&gt;<i> such as malformed requests, missing exchange, etc, close the channel

Assuring that all these are raised and caught provides no end of  
amusement.

There doesn't appear to be a way for the server to signal these errors  
short of tearing down the connection.  So catching this is a matter  
for your heartbeats or your doing it at the transport layer.  Correct?

&gt;<i> Routing failures of messages with the
</I>&gt;<i> 'mandatory' or 'immediate' flag are signalled to the client with an
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronous basic.return command.
</I>
&gt;<i> Are you saying that in py-amqplib there is no way to get hold of the
</I>&gt;<i> latter until channel closure?
</I>
If I'm reading the code correctly the client (next time it reads from  
the channel) will dispatch to the basic_return method of the Channel  
object.  The Channel class does not have that method defined.  I could  
be wrong.

&gt;<i> If so that would seem to be an omission in
</I>&gt;<i> the library and I suggest you take that up with the authors.
</I>
True that.  Crosstalk is good.  Py-amqplib is an important complement  
to rabbitmq.  There isn't a py-ampqlib mailing list, correct?

interesting:  &quot;issue *any* synchronous command.  The response  
constitutes a guarantee that all messages published prior  to the  
request will have been processed by the channel process on the server.&quot;

That seems useful.  If you had the heart beat enabled would that tell  
you something similar?  Again not interoperable.

Do you have a synch. cmd you'd recommend.
