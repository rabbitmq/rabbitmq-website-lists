<PRE>Hi Ben,

Just my $0.02, but, I got the impression a (durable=True,
auto_delete=True) use case means: &quot;Delete the queue ONLY after all
messages have been removed from the queue -- once the queue is empty.&quot;

A condition where this would apply is: Consider a producer/consumer
scenario.  The consumer creates a static exchange/queue (durable=True,
auto_delete=False) such that in the event of a network error, the
consumer can reconnect and resync with the queue.  Upon receipt of a
new message, the consumer sends an ACK message (part of the
application -- not the AMQP spec) back to the producer (using the
reply-to: header).

The producer creates a temporary exchange/queue (durable=True,
auto_delete=True) for receiving these ACK messages such that in the
event of a network error, the producer can reconnect and resync with
the queue.  From the producer's point of view, it wants a queue that
*remains alive until all messages have been flushed* from the queue.
In this case, lost messages are not acceptable.

A downside to this approach (obviously) are cases where logic errors
in the producer cause the producing app to die, which becomes a more
common problem than network errors.  In this case, RabbitMQ ends up
with a bunch of temporary producer queues with (maybe) one or 1 ACK
messages in each queue, that stick around forever.  In this case,
you'd have to write some sort of utility script to purge the
no-longer-used queues.

Therefore, (durable=True, auto_delete=True) comes in handy in cases
where the producing app:

1) has no logic errors (that cause it to disconnect without emptying its queue)
2) is talking across a network that is prone to channel disconnects

A couple of side notes:
- In this scenario, it maybe possible to 'timeout' a (durable=True,
auto_delete=True) queue, where if it has messages and has no
consumers, wait X minutes before deleting (configurable).

- If (durable=True, auto_delete=True) becomes an invalid configuration
in the next version of the AMQP specification, then the producing app
would have to contain application-level logic to deal with network
disconnects (rather than rely on AMQP to do the right thing).  Or, it
would have to switch to declaring a static queue and not rely on the
auto_delete option.

Regards,

</I>&gt;<i> In the file amqp-0.8.json the auto_delete flag on queue.declare is off.

</I>&gt;<i> The relevance of this is marginal because it is up to what the client

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Upon restart after a server

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The events that trigger a consideration of the auto_delete flag in

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would consider it to be odd, but I'm not a lawyer.

</I>&gt;<i> Though the exact behavior of this scenario is IMHO not clearly defined
