One of the first things I wanted to do was to improve the current test
suite to add quite a few more &quot;pure&quot; unit tests (right now it's almost
all functional and integration tests), and start adding in clover
coverage analysis. That's where the previous email title started up,
because one of the first things that I looked at was moving some or
all of the test framework from JUnit 3.8.1 to JUnit 4 (which of course
I can't do effectively if 1.4 is still a major requirement in the
future).

Then the first crazy/mundane thing that I was going to attempt was a
connection pooling system. Because that'll be quite complex, I want to
tackle the test side first so that I'm confident that I'm not breaking
things in subtle ways.

What ideas did you have?

Kirk
