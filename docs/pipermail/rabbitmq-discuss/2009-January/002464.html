Sure. If performance is not an issue then this approach is fine.

I'm not saying that is necessarily is a network issue, it's just that
I don't have any points to speculate about at this point in time.

The main issue is that you can't reproduce these symptoms.

Short of being able to reproduce this somehow in order to debug this -
is it possible that you could send us your code so that we can maybe
infer something from that? It's a long shot, but none of the other
clues that you've given us so far have led to any plausible hypothesis
