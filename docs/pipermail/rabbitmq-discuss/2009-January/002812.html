<PRE>Hello,
I am new to RabbitMQ, but am curious if it could be used in an embedded 
systems environment to publish messages.  We have a network of 
environmental sensors in various locations that output real-time wind 
information using RS-232 Serial.  We have an embedded device connected 
to the sensor that uses the Lantronix xPort embedded device server to 
convert serial to Ethernet (<A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/3toe4">http://tinyurl.com/3toe4</A>).  Today, these 
distributed devices connect via TCP over the Internet to a centrally 
located home server and just constantly print out their information 
every couple seconds, which we then process and log as appropriate in a 
database, which is subsequently polled by Web-based clients to show near 
real-time updates form the sensors.  Instead of this architecture, we 
think it might be advantageous to use RabbitMQ to publish the messages, 
giving us greater control and flexibility.  Doing so requires an AMQP 
client, either running on the embedded device server, or on some other 
component we run in the environment at the location of the remote 
sensor, where today we do not have any traditional PC (due to cost 
reasons -- we have only a DSL modem, router and our embedded sensor 
device).  We could consider, for example, a Linksys WRT54G running 
OpenWRT Linux - does anyone have experience running RabbitMQ or another 
RabbitMQ-compatible AMQP client in such an environment, perhaps on an 
Linksys WRT54G or similar embedded device?  The advantage of the OpenWRT 
route is that we could avoid custom firmware hacking on the Lantronix, 
which uses a proprietary environment called DSTni.  Thanks in advance 
for any tips or pointers on AMQP clients in such an environment.  Also, 
if this is something someone would be interested in tackling on a 
consulting/contractor basis, let me know, as I would be happy to fund a 
RabbitMQ port to OpenWRT (or better option) if the cost were reasonable 
and it would benefit the community.  Thanks,
-angus
