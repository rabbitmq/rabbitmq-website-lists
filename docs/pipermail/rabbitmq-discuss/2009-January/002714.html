<PRE>Hi Darien,

That's right.

&gt;<i> 2) Is there any reference in the AMQP specification for dealing with

</I>&gt;<i> previously stated), what is the default time delay?
</I>
Currently AMQP doesn't have support for configuring such a timeout, and
RabbitMQ doesn't implement one, either. It seems like a useful idea,
though. If it were implemented, I'd imagine that if you didn't
acknowledge a message within the timeout, the server would issue a
channel.close, which would have as a side-effect the rollback of any
transactions and the release of any &quot;acquired&quot; messages.

However, could it be done some other way, avoiding the need for an
extension to the protocol or a change to the server? Perhaps some kind
of watchdog on the client side that throcks the connection when it
notices that the message-processing part of the client is wedged?

&gt;<i> 3) Is it possible that in order to achieve this type of behavior, you
</I>&gt;<i> have to use transactions (tx) or distributed transactions (dtx) in
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ?
</I>
I don't think so -- in a way, ack-required messages even on ordinary
non-TX channels are like tiny, single-operation transactions that can
rollback (on channel close) or commit (on ack).

Regards,
  Tony
