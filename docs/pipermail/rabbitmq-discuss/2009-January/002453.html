<PRE>Tim,

Because of the implication of this statement from you:

&quot;eg, in the real world, I can make a provisional booking, which times
out if I don't commit to a firm booking within a known (possibly
variable) timeline.&quot;

Unless I see this incorrectly, a provisional booking implies
temporally exclusive access to the resource that you have requested.
Were this not the case, a provisional booking would be of questionable
value, because it would only reflect resource availability at the
point in time that the request was processed. Beyond that, this
*booking* would be meaningless.

&gt;<i> This sounds like a scale issue, in general, which will drive the interaction process

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the resource that my app's looking to 'get a lock on' gets consumed, the

</I>
As indicated above, what would be the value of this lock if doesn't
actually lock anything?

If it's not really a lock, then what implication does this have for
the I in ACID?

What I fail to see here is where the logical unit of work is here if
an external process can affect the outcome of your transaction - e.g.
somebody else actually booking and paying for the plane seats you were
eyeballing whilst your code was waiting for each TX-participant to
reach a consensus.

BTW - did Carl ever post you his answer to your problem?

Ben
