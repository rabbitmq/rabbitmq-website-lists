Are you sure there is nothing of interest in rabbit logs, apart from timeouts, on both 
instances? Maybe something in system logs?

Any info in client logs maybe that could explain why all of them connected to a single 
broker (I assume normally you spread connections somewhat equally between the 2 brokers)?
