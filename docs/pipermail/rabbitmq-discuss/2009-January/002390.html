As an example, imagine a task queue to which jobs are submitted. A 
'worker' takes a message from this queue, performs some processing and 
then publishes a response to a specified reply queue.

If this happens under an atomic transaction, then either the response is 
enqueued *and* the task it corresponds to is dequeued or the task 
remains on the queue to be reprocessed and the response is discarded.

That is my view of what the tx class is for and one example of why it 
can be useful.

All dtx adds to the picture is allowing that transaction to also include 
operations on other resources. E.g. in the example above it might be 
that the job involves some updates to the database and these can be made 
atomic w.r.t the enqueue of the response and the dequeue of the job itself.
