<PRE>Hi, I'm using .NET client 2.8.7 on Windows. Getting intermittent timeouts 
when trying to publish a message. The stack trace is below. 

I do NOT think this problem is probabilistic in nature, meaning it does NOT 
happen to a percentage of the attempts.
Instead, there seems to be a condition emerging which causes this. As the 
library I use on top of RabbitMQ .NET client (MassTransit) knows how to 
retry on failure, most of these do not cause disruptions, but if the 
condition window sometimes stays open long enough to exceed the number of 
retries, then it becomes noticeable to the user.

I think (but not sure) it seems to happen after a period of inactivity, 
after the connection has been open but idle for a while.

This seems to only happen when the connection crosses the DMZ boundary, so 
the NAT factor may be involved. Also, I run on virtualized hardware at 
Rackspace, so this may be an additional factor.

Did anybody experience this and has any suggestions on how I could 
troubleshoot / identify / workaround the issue?

RabbitMQ.Client.Exceptions.AlreadyClosedException: The AMQP operation was 
interrupted: AMQP close-reason, initiated by Library, code=0, text=&quot;Socket 
exception&quot;, classId=0, methodId=0, cause=System.Net.Sockets.SocketException 
(0x80004005): A connection attempt failed because the connected party did 
not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection 
failed because connected host has failed to respond
