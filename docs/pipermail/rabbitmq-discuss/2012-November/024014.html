<PRE>Hi Matthias,

I want to pick up the anti-pattern note as I will put some time into finding
some more queue anti-patterns.   I'll try to share how I am using the
queues.

In my framework I have the ability to issue function/result type messages.  
The framework will also split large messages into smaller packets.

The function request typically always goes into a queue that is static.  For
example a ping service would have a queue based upon the computer's name. 
Any ping request to the computer would be put into the queue.  Results of
the ping would generate a new queue.  Each result will be placed into a
unique result queue that is created for each result published.  The result
queue is based upon a name that the server and client both know.  I went
with this design to eliminate the need to build routing logic to route
results from a queue to waiting callers.  I also didn't want a caller's
result be dependent upon another caller's result within a single queue.

Ping is an example. The Framework allows for the development of services for
other purposes.  AMQP works very well for clients that have to work behind
firewalls.  This is why I am using rabbitMQ instead of using other tools for
RPC style development.

I will think about the result queue not being mirrored as this would greatly
improve performance but does make rabbitMQ server maintenance more
difficult.  If the node with the queue is shutdown and the client connects
to a new node the result queue would be recreated.  The framework helps
manage queues by letting clients declare the queues.


Message Split
I ran into issues with my cluster testing when messages become large enough
to negatively impact the cluster.  My test cluster only has 1 gig of ram per
computer (3 servers).  The message size plus slowly draining queues will
easily destroy this test cluster.  I would run into issues with the erlang
node heartbeat.  I would also run into issues where erlang would run out of
ram even with the default high watermark + flow control.  Erlang would crash
bringing down the rabbitmq node.  To avoid message sizes from destroying the
cluster I have implemented logic to split messages greater than a known size
into smaller packets.

If a large message is detected it will be split into smaller packets.  A
split indicator message will be placed into the original target queue.  The
actual message will be split into smaller packets and published into a newly
created queue just for the split.  Each split message will have an equal
split queue.
The original target queue may have two or more subscribers.  A subscriber
will receive a split indicator message.  It will then begin to subscribe and
drain the message's split queue.  When completed all messages are acked. 
This allows the split message queue to be processed by a single client while
the original queue can have any number of subscribers.  When the split queue
is finished it is disposed of.

I know i am getting a performance hit with the dynamic queues but their use
made the two scenarios much easier to implement.  Although, I am open to
alternative methods in implementing the above.

-Mark
