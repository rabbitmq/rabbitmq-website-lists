<PRE>Thank you Liz,

We've now found the problem, filed a bug and fixed it. Hopefully the fix will be released in 3.0.1 in the very near future. :)

Thanks again for reporting this, and providing us with all the information that has helped us track it down!

&gt;&gt;<i> One more question please. Is the node that you're trying to shut down hanging *indefinitely* or for a very long time, or for a minute or so?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In all cases for which I've sent logs/trace outputs, the shutdown hangs indefinitely.   I've also seen instances where it hangs for a very long time (~5 minutes) but those were not reproducible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When the rabbit is stuck shutting down, is the source host for shovelB and shovelB_realtime (server.local) accessible - i.e., you can ping it, telnet to the amqp port, etc? It seems these two shovels have never got properly started, and they're hung (still trying to establish connections/channels) when you're trying to shut down. We are filing a bug and looking at how to fix this, but it would be helpful for me to understand the topology so I can simulate this bug when producing a fix.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I checked the connections to and from server.local using ping and telneting to the amqp port and both look okay at the time the shutdown is hanging.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Other information that may be of use:
</I>&gt;<i>  * server.local does not have any special configuration (no rabbitmq.config file)
</I>&gt;<i>  * I can reproduce this more reliably with 2.8.7 than 3.0.0
</I>&gt;<i>  * We're initiating the shutdown shortly after bootup
