</I>
There are two extension points within RabbitMQ here.

The EXTERNAL plugin is an example of how to implement a SASL mechanism 
(rabbit_auth_mechanism behaviour), i.e. control the exchange of 
information on the wire within AMQP, leading to authN. By default &quot;the 
exchange of information ion the wire&quot; means &quot;send username and 
password&quot;, but it doesn't have to.

The rabbit_auth_backend behaviour then does two thing:

* Determines how to do authN for a user when we've already decided how 
to do the wire level stuff (e.g. look up in internal DB, make an LDAP 
query).

* Determines how to do authZ once we have a #user{} record.

- in other words it's a &quot;user database&quot;.

Note that all the existing rabbit_auth_mechanism implementations call 
into rabbit_access_control:check_user_pass_login/2 or similar - that's 
the entry point to go and find out which rabbit_auth_backends are 
configured and go and query them for authentication.

I suspect to do Kerberos you will need both behaviours - from a quick 
google I *think* you need to control the wire level protocol with 
rabbit_auth_mechanism, and then create a #user{} based on that.

</I>&gt;<i> * Implement check_vhost_access and check_resource_access but just have

</I>&gt;<i> Later we are planning on implementing an authZ *only* plugin for

</I>&gt;<i> implements check_vhost_access and check_resource_access?
</I>
Well, how do you want it to work? At the moment rabbit_auth_backend ties 
together authN and authZ, because if a backend is the authority that 
says that a user exists, it is likely to the be the only thing which can 
sensibly decide what that user is allowed to do.

You *could* decouple these by having one rabbit_auth_backend which 
implements check_user_login/2 and returns a #user{} with its 
auth_backend field set to a different rabbit_auth_backend that would 
then do authZ. We could add more support for that in RabbitMQ, but I'm 
not sure how your use case works.

&gt;<i> 2, I have started to create my code and the idea is to use open_port to open an

</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/simmel/rabbitmq-auth-backend-kerberos">https://github.com/simmel/rabbitmq-auth-backend-kerberos</A>&gt;. The code compiles,
</I>&gt;<i> heh, and RabbitMQ starts and &quot;accepts&quot; the connection but some how it fails
</I>&gt;<i> anyway.
</I>
I ran your code. Check the SASL log (confusingly that's nothing to do 
with the SASL protocol, it's Erlang's &quot;System Application Support 
Libraries&quot;. In RabbitMQ terms it's the &quot;log of things which crashed&quot;. 
You should see:

=CRASH REPORT==== 13-Nov-2012::11:04:03 ===
   crasher:
     initial call: rabbit_reader:init/4
     pid: &lt;0.334.0&gt;
     registered_name: []
     exception exit: {unexpected_message,{'EXIT',#Port&lt;0.25776&gt;,normal}}
       in function  rabbit_reader:handle_other/3 (src/rabbit_reader.erl, 
line 363)
       in call from rabbit_reader:start_connection/7 
(src/rabbit_reader.erl, line 238)

i.e. you got a message saying the port had closed. Your plugin 
(executing in the reader process) did not handle this message, and the 
reader process is designed to crash when it receives a message it didn't 
expect.

So make sure to receive that message in your plugin...

Cheers, Simon
