<PRE>Hi everyone

I have following scenario:
1) Many Android clients (from 1000 to 10 000 clients) - not connected all 
the time (messaging seems like good fit for this)
2) Each sending max 100 messages\day
3) Also needs to send some messages back from server but not very 
frequently (10\day)

I was looking on rabbit tutorials, AMQP spec etc.
It looks like collecting data from androids is easy task. All will send 
data into single exchange\queue.
But what about sending messages to Androids from server?
1st i was thinking about having single queue and to subcribe from each 
device with some kind of &quot;filter&quot; (based on some header field). I know 
there are message brokers which support this scenario.
But it seems Rabbit doesn't support this. Do i really have to create one 
&quot;sending&quot; queue for each client (using direct exchange with proper &quot;per 
device&quot; routing key) ?
How much overhead queues in rabbit have ?
It can be also management issue and really feels like overkill when number 
of messages send from server to device is really low....

Any advice will be appriciated.
Thanks

Michal
