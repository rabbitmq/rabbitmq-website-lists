<PRE>Hello All,

We are in process of evaluating rabbitmq as our messaging solution for a 
high load application. We are using Heroku Workers as the consumers of the 
task from the mq. 
We are thinking of a solution where rabbitmq does the task distribution 
job, such that as soon as a heroku worker comes up it declares a queue and 
binds itself to an exchange. However as I understand exchange (direct) 
 will publish the messages to all the queues binded with the same routing 
key.Since each heroku worker subscribes to its queue all of them will 
receive the same message.

Using a single worker queue seems to do the job, but the volumes we are 
looking at is approximately 10,000 msg/sec. So my question is if there are 
any limit on the capacity of single worker queue? And are there any other 
solution available out of the box for the load distribution which scales 
automatically with scaling out of workers?

Thanks in advance!
