Just the rates in /api/overview or the ones in /api/queues as well?

&gt;<i> I understand a bit from the sources that in this /api/overview call from

</I>
Yes. We get basic queue information from the Mnesia database, and then 
augment it with statistics information (including rates) from the 
(in-memory) management database.

&gt;<i> Could it be that some of these values are 0 because of certain time-outs
</I>&gt;<i> while getting the data?
</I>
No, the requests for stats don't time out.

&gt;<i> In other words: do I have to start searching for
</I>&gt;<i> the problem at the database disk/IO level?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i> I couldn't see any IO waits on the machine indicating something else is
</I>&gt;<i> happening at the time. Also CPU load is normal.
</I>&gt;<i> Still the weird thing is that this also happens on a test machine at
</I>&gt;<i> roughly the same times.
</I>&gt;<i> Since both machines are VM's, this might indicate that it could be an
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructural problem, but I'd like to be sure before accusing 'others'.
</I>
If /api/overview and /api/queues contradict each other I'd like to know 
about it.

But if the rates drop to 0 in /api/queues as well, Occam's Razor 
suggests that maybe your consumers are pausing for some reason :)

Cheers, Simon
