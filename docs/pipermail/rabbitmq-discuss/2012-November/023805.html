No.

But if the database is busy with something else then it could take a 
while to process the updates it's received. I find it hard to believe 
that it could be busy for 5 minutes though.

There is nothing scheduled once an hour in RabbitMQ though - so whatever 
is happening once an hour must be outside the broker. Figuring out what 
that is would help a lot.

</I>
Just to be clear: is this just the rates in /api/overview or the ones in 
/api/queues as well?

I'd also be interested to see the output of:

rabbitmqctl eval 'process_info(global:whereis_name(rabbit_mgmt_db), 
[message_queue_len,status, current_stacktrace]).'

when the statistics drop to 0.

Cheers, Simon
