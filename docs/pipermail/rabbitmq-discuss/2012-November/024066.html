Hi Jonas,

This question was followed up by a conversation on IRC where you 
mentioned that consumers would connect using MQTT. It is currently only 
possible to use one topic exchange via the RabbitMQ MQTT adapter, so any 
authentication mechanism relying on different exchange permissions won't 
work.

Other MQTT brokers solve this problem by granting permissions to 
different parts of the topic hierarchy in a static ACL configuration 
file (e.g. RSMB does this). Unfortunately RabbitMQ does not currently 
offer the granularity of access control that allows you to grant access 
based on routing key patterns.

You could use public key encryption to prevent eavesdropping. Private 
messages could be encrypted so that only the intended recipient can 
decrypt it. Though this does run counter to the  light-eight nature of MQTT.
