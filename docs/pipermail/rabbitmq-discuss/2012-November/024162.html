<PRE>I apologize for the long-winded-ness, I hope that I've painted a good picture of what I'm trying to do...

Currently, I have a Federated Exchange setup between 2-nodes, let's call them rabbit1 and rabbit2.  When I publish messages to the exchange on rabbit2, they can be received in a queue on rabbit1.  Fantastic!

Now I'd like to add clustering into the mix.  I created a new node, let's call it rabbit3, and created a cluster between rabbit2 and rabbit3.  I've updated the local-nodename federation parameter on both rabbit2 and rabbit3.  I've added rabbit3 as an upstream for the federated exchange on rabbit1.

With all 3 nodes running, if I publish to the upstream exchange on either rabbit2 or rabbit3, the message properly appears on rabbit1.  If I shutdown rabbit2 (which was the original upstream node), and I try to publish to the upstream exchange on rabbit3, I received &quot;Message published, but not routed.&quot; (I'm testing via the Management UI).

If I look at the Federation Status on rabbit1, it appears that the State of the connection to rabbit2 toggles between &quot;error&quot; and &quot;shutdown&quot;, while the State of the connection to rabbit3 toggles between &quot;starting&quot; and &quot;shutdown&quot;.

Further investigation shows that the internal upstream queue does not exist on rabbit3, but does exist on rabbit2.

I'm not quite sure where I may have gone wrong.  By adding the new clustered node as an upstream on rabbit1, I guess that I expected the same configuration would be pushed-to/created-on rabbit3 that was previously created on rabbit2.

My intentions are to publish messages to a clustered exchange which are then pushed up to the federated exchange.

Any ideas?
