<PRE>Hello all, I am reading through the rabbitMQ tutorial, and I've reached the 
&quot;Round Robin Dispatching&quot; section in the 2nd tutorial. I was able to create 
multiple &quot;workers&quot; and any messages added to the queue they were both 
looking at would be spread out between them. I was wondering if there was a 
way to force a message to be sent to all workers reading from a particular 
queue? It appears that  the message is &quot;removed&quot; from the queue once a 
worker gets it, but I'd like all workers looking at a queue to read the 
message. I was also considering, as perhaps a better way of achieving the 
above,  having each worker listen to a unique queue so I could tell each 
worker what to do specifically - is this a common rabbitMQ idiom? 

Thank you.
