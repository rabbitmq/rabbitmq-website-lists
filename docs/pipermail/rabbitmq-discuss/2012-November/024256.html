<PRE>It's not that I want shovel to be more opinionated, just more informative.  For example, I'm playing with a topology that includes both federation and shovel.  I'd like to offer the consumers the ability to have a true understanding of the path of the message.  Currently, the x-received-from header only includes the upstream exchanges where the message was published.  If the message was originally &quot;shoveled&quot; from a remote queue to the upstream exchange, I'd like the x-received-from header to indicate both the source (shoveled queue), and the upstream exchange.

Is it possible to &quot;fake&quot; the x-received-from header using the 'publish_properties' config item?

I wrote a test using the .NET client where my client app manually creates the x-received-from header for the original &quot;shoveled&quot; queue.  It appears that the Federation plugin simply appends to it, which is nice.  It would be nice if it were done automagically!

Yes, that makes sense. Although there is a philosophical difference here
- federation is designed to be opinionated, and shovel was designed not to be. Although I wouldn't mind making shovel a bit more opinionated.

Note that you *can* add your own headers during shovelling with the 'publish_properties' config item.
