Auto-deletion is only useful when there can be multiple consumers. Those 
multiple consumers would all need to know the queue name. Which usually 
implies it is known in advance, rather than server-generated and then 
shared.

By contrast, if the queue is exclusive then it will get deleted when the 
connection closes. Server-named queues work well here. When 
reconnecting, simply declare a queue the same way as you did initially, 
i.e.let the server pick a (new) name. For that to work, obviously none 
of your code must hold on to the original name.

Regards,

Matthias.
