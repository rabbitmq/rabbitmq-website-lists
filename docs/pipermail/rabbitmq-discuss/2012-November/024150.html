<PRE>We've made good progress vetting the Federation Plugin and are pleased with what we've seen thus far.

Currently, we've deployed 3 RabbitMQ nodes and configured the Federation Plugin such that:

Exchange A &lt;--&gt; Exchange B &lt;--&gt; Exchange C

For our purposes, messages published to Exchange A can be received by a Queue bound to Exchange C and messages published to Exchange C can be received by a Queue bound to Exchange A.

My question is this.  Let's assume that the server hosting Exchange B suffers a catastrophic failure.  As I understand it, and as we've seen in our configuration (by stopping Rabbit on node B), messages will queue up in the Internal queues for both Federated Exchanges A &amp; C.  If such an event would occur, how does one recover in such a way that the Internal Queues can drain naturally as configured?

I tried to provide enough details, but may not have been that clear.  Please let me know if there are any questions.
</PRE>
