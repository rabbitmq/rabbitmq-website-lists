Hi,

It is possible that a partition could cause less logging on some nodes
and that could end up looking like a gap. Access to the logs may help,
even if there is a gap.

&gt;<i> 1.) If my queues/exchange are set to HA, why do they continually get lost during network partitions?
</I>
That shouldn't happen. From the sasl logfiles provided it is clear that
you are dealing with the effects of a bug. We are trying to replicate
the bug, and access to the logfiles will probably help. Please feel free
to contact me directly to arrange transfer, if that will help.

&gt;<i> 2.) Would using autoheal handle this scenario better?
</I>
If the root cause relates to partition healing then a different
partition strategy may fail to trigger the bug. Please let us know if
that is the case.


We will be grateful for any information that you can provide about how
to replicate it. How reliably can you replicate the bug? You mentioned
network partitions - do queues get lost each time a network partition
occurs? Does changing the partition handling strategy make any difference?





-Emile
