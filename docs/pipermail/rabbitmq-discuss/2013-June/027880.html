<PRE>Hi guys.
What is the best practices on who should create all the queues and 
exchanges?
I see the three options:
1. consumer-app creates everything and it MUST be started before the 
producer-app
2. both consumer-app and producer-app create these objects on startup so 
it does not matter which one starts first.
3. queues and exchanges are put into the broker configuration so they 
are created automatically when broker starts.

It looks to me that #3 would be the best way. The apps do not need to 
have any code which initialises stuff, user accounts
applications use can be restricted etc.
But I cannot find the &quot;official&quot; way of doing it.
We tried using shovel plugin because it allows you to declare all these 
queues and exchanges to be created.
It kind of works but it feels a bit dodgy.

So what is the right way?

Thanks!
