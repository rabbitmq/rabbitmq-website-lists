<PRE>We are using a Windows 2008 Server R2 for our RabbitMQ server.  With RabbitMQ 3.0.4 running as a service, under the local system account. This service, to be in a cluster needed the .erlang.cookie to be in the C:\Windows directory.

With that said, where would the MNESIA database files be located?

Currently I can only see them under my account on the server, however, those do not seem to be the correct files? I ask as we are trying to integrate with Hyperic HQ, and we can't seem to find the proper MNESIA DB files that would yield the proper monitoring/statistics.

I can't seem to find any way to show the file locations via Rabbitmqctl.bat or the Rabbit Management Plugin.

Thank you for your time,
-Christopher Lefevre
