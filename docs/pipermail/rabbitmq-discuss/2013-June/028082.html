Hi,

And what about the network speed? I would still try an independent
bandwidth test from network to disk to give you a comparison reference.

The numbers you quoted are about 2 orders of magnitude lower than I
would expect for that hardware. Bear in mind that the queue process is
typically the most CPU-intensive process. A queue on a single server can
occupy at most one CPU, so will benefit more from a faster CPU than from
many CPUs.

Not yet, but hopefully someone who knows more about the Pika client than
me will be able to comment.

Yes, and the asynchronous choice is typically faster.


If you are still stuck with very low throughput then I would recommend
you try the MulticastMain utility, included in the RabbitMQ Java client.
It includes support for many of the options that you want to compare,
