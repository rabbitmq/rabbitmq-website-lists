<PRE>Hi, 

I just wanted to mention that we are seeing the same behavior, but we don't 
have any mirrored queues. We have had to disable the management interface 
and the memory usage gradually dropped.

We are using 3.1.1 on R13B04 on some machines, and a few others with Erlang 
R16B.

I looked into the code, and it creates some ets tables in the 
rabbit_mgmt_db module. The first snippet is memory usage with the 
management plugin:

 {memory,
     [{total,1417822136},
      {connection_procs,37788152},
      {queue_procs,6659896},
      {plugins,686592},
      {other_proc,11236576},
      {mnesia,855184},
      {mgmt_db,935311000},
      {msg_index,7976224},
      {other_ets,70559680},
      {binary,13529704},
      {code,19001963},
      {atom,1601817},
      {other_system,312615348}]},


This second snippet is after disabling the management plugin and restarting 
one of the nodes:
 

[{total,190412936},

{memory,
{connection_procs,34512200},
{queue_procs,8970352},
{plugins,0},
{other_proc,9246776},
{mnesia,794776},
{mgmt_db,0},
{msg_index,1650736},
{other_ets,6406656},
{binary,63363448},
{code,16232973},
{atom,594537},
{other_system,48640482}]}


You'll notice that the memory used by mgmt_db is not 0 and other_system is 
around 48MB, while before mgmt_db was over 935MB, and other_system over 
300MB. Unfortunately, I don't have any growth trends for the DB size as we 
have had to disable management on all nodes and we weren't tracking this 
memory usage.

I'm not very familiar with RabbitMQ, but if I have some time I will try and 
dig more deeply into it and run some tests.

</I>&gt;<i> We have two clustered brokers, both running RabbitMQ 3.1.1 on Erlang

</I>&gt;<i> queued and most queues typically sit idle.

</I>&gt;<i> I'll be happy to provide any further diagnostic information.
