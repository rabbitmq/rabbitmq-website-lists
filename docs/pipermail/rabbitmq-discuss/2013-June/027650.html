<PRE>Just to be clear - at what point in this test are you unblocking the 
connection so the partition can heal?

Cheers, Simon

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi. The behaviour you describe doesn't really match what I would
</I>&gt;<i> expect to see. In the beginning of a partition I would expect:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Partition starts
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Things behave slowly for approximately net_ticktime (see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#net_ticktime">http://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html#net_ticktime</A>) as nodes
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to contact each other and time out
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) On each node, Erlang decides the other nodes are down. Things
</I>&gt;<i> speed up again, HA queues fail over. Split-brain has begun.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds like you were stuck in 2) for an extended period of time.
</I>&gt;<i> Have you changed net_ticktime?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, when testing partitions I have see really odd
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour by blocking network traffic in one direction only with
</I>&gt;<i> iptables. You might want to check if you've done that by mistake.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Follow-up question ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I tried some experiments to gain some understanding of how the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cluster behaved with clients attached during a network partition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event. Essentially, I repeated the previous tests described below
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for autohealing and automatic queue synchronization, but left the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cluster communications port blocked while the client test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completed. One oddity I noticed was that while the consumer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connected to the slave appeared to receive an indication that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something was amiss (client log showed a consumer cancel exception
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being handled by the Spring AMQP framework, and other monitoring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> logs appeared to show the client restarting a connection, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems to be consistent with documentation), the consumer connected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the master seemed to remain oblivious to any possible issues.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That consumer continued to receive messages, but at an extremely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slow rate (test published at 16/sec fixed rate, but the remaining
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consumer began to receive messages at the rate of about 1 every 14
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seconds).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since the test client waits around for expected message deliveries
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a resettable 30 second timeout, it continued to run for an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extended period of time (longer than I waited around for).  In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addition, the admin console showed a relatively small number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unacked messages on that server, with the unacked count increasing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with each actual delivery (client should always be acknowledging
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the test setup, and reported no errors).  Eventually unblocking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the cluster port released a bunch of messages in a short interval
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (albeit with some lost, as described previously).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also saw  producer connections go into flow control during the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outage and remain there during the slow consumer delivery (though
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the test had long since completed delivering all its messages).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does this sound like expected behavior during a partition?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> To simulate a network partition failure, I've been using iptables
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to temporarily block inbound and outbound access on one of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> nodes to the single port configured for cluster communications
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> through inet_dist_listen_min and inet_dist_listen_max settings
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (min = max). Client access is not blocked during a simulated
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> partition fault.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sounds reasonable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I've observed two anomalies during testing that I wasn't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> expecting based on the documentation I've read:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> -At a sufficiently high message rate, some number of messages
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will be lost during the fault sequence, with the number lost
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tending to increase with message rate.  No indication of a send
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> error has been observed by the client program. Based on results
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> obtained from test logs and an independent monitor listening on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> trace messages from each node, it appears that as soon as the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> port is blocked, both nodes continue to accept published
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> messages, but (temporarily) stop delivering messages until the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cluster heartbeat failure is detected, at which point the cluster
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is partitioned and the slave promotes itself to become master. In
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the sequences I've looked at, the messages that are lost all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> appear to be published to the original master (and final master
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> after a winner is selected during autoheal). Neither the start
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> nor the end of the lost message window appear to line up with any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> events in the logs, other than the start occurring sometime after
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the port connection is blocked but before the cluster heartbeat
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> failure is detected, and the end occurring sometime after the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> detection of the cluster heartbeat failure and before the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> detection of the partitioned cluster after the connection is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unblocked.  Is message loss to be expected in this scenario?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would expect to see message loss in a cluster heal scenario.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's important to remember that a cluster partition is still a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> substantial problem, and the healing process involves throwing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state away. Autoheal mode just means you get through this process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> faster, and hopefully spend much less time accepting messages that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will end up being lost.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would expect intuitively that only messages from the losing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partitions would be lost. But I am not entirely surprised if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages from the winner are lost too; there is a period after the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partitions have come back together but before autoheal kicks in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> during which we will have multiple masters for a queue, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behaviour can be unpredictable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> -Occasionally the autoheal loser node fails to rejoin the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cluster after restart.  I don't have a lot of data points on this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one since it's only happened a handful of times during overnight
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> test iterations.  During one failure, the autoheal winner showed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the log message below during recovery:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ah, that looks like a bug in autoheal. I think the stack trace you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> posted should contain enough information to fix it. Thanks.
