<PRE>I've attached the sasl log from mq-002. Sorry I didn't include that originally.

Thanks for taking a look.

Hi. Looking at the logs it seems like the message store on mq-002 crashed / shut down unexpectedly, but there's no information about this in the log. Do you have the corresponding sasl log?

Cheers, Simon

While testing a fail-over scenario with RabbitMQ 3.1.1 I have repeatedly encountered errors, sometimes resulting in durable queues vanishing.

The cluster consists of two brokers using LVS / keepalived in order to connect clients to a functional broker. There are 10 mirrored queues, each of which has ha-sync-mode = automatic. A script is used to shut down one broker or the other in turn using 'service rabbitmq-server {start|stop}', such that there is always one broker running and leaving at least 30 seconds between each start / stop. I am expecting that this test should be able to run indefinitely without destabilising the cluster, however I have not been able to achieve more than a few dozen fail-overs without some error occurring. I'm hoping someone may have some insight or suggestions as to how to stabilise this environment.

I have included basic environment details below and attached logs from both brokers showing one example. In this case zg-dev-mq-003 was stopped at 11:32:21 and went through what appears to be a clean shutdown:

=INFO REPORT==== 9-Jun-2013::11:33:22 === Halting Erlang VM

zg-dev-mq-002 detected the other broker down and promoted itself to master. Then after accepting connections from clients it logged an error as shown below:
