Erm, persister.LOG suggests a RabbitMQ pre 2.0.0. Is that true? We would
very strongly recommend you upgrade asap.

Yeah, that's not going to make any difference to pre 2.0 Rabbits. Pre
2.0, all msgs are always held in RAM.

&gt;<i> I've got another server with 24GB of RAM, so I set it's HOSTNAME to

</I>
That's odd - if the hostname and the nodename of Rabbit is the same, it
should start up I think. Is there anything in the logs?
