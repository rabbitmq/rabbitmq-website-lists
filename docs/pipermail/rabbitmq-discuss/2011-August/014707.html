<PRE>Hi Andrea,

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For some reason, that we can't understand, we have got a queue
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with two
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consumers and one of this consumer is using a channel of a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> connection that is not present in the list of connections.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That should not be possible. If you check the connection pid of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each channel with &quot;rabbitmqctl list_channels connection&quot; each of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them should appear in the output of &quot;rabbitmqctl list_connections
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pid&quot;. Is that not the case?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for my late reply. I verified and you are right it's not
</I>&gt;<i> correct what I wrote. The situation is that I have a queue with two
</I>&gt;<i> consumer on two different connections. It seems that one of this
</I>&gt;<i> consumer is a &quot;zombie&quot;, to fix the situation I closed all connection
</I>
I assume you mean the client thinks it is connected, but the server
thinks the client is not connected.

&gt;<i> and restarted my application After that there is just one consumer
</I>&gt;<i> listening on the queue. Is it possible that rabbitmq DB become
</I>&gt;<i> inconsistency/corrupted (for some reason) and that creates this
</I>
Your description does not suggest DB corruption.

&gt;<i> situation? In this case to clean up the db I can delete the mnesia
</I>&gt;<i> folder and restart the server? Is it possible to have more details in
</I>&gt;<i> the rabbitmq log files?
</I>
Restarting the broker will terminate connections, so that will probably
work. If the client and server disagree about the connection status then
a broker logfile won't be much help.

Your description is more consistent with an unreliable network, or a
faulty firewall setup. I would look there first.

Does AMQP heartbeats solve the problem?
Does a comparison of netstat output on the clients and the broker yield
any inconsistencies?
Did any of the other means of obtaining diagnostic information
previously mentioned produce useful information?
