<PRE>I have seen those log files of which you speak. They are ..... large, to say
the least.

I just checked in to app and SASL and there's nothing from that time frame.
On the host which had the queue in question, the best I have is 78k SASL
messages over the course of the day that look like the one I pasted below.

=SUPERVISOR REPORT==== 9-Aug-2011::12:19:16 ===
     Supervisor: {&lt;0.7200.4&gt;,rabbit_channel_sup_sup}
     Context:    shutdown_error
     Reason:     shutdown
     Offender:   [{pid,&lt;0.15122.24&gt;},
                  {name,channel_sup},
                  {mfa,{rabbit_channel_sup,start_link,[]}},
                  {restart_type,temporary},
                  {shutdown,infinity},
                  {child_type,supervisor}]


I can email you logs, but they're really not exciting. It's all just noise
as messages were published and consumers had yet to initialize and declare
exchanges, queues and bindings.

I assume you have tests for spooling to disk when rabbit is low on memory.
Has this been tested in a cluster situation such as I described?

I checked our configurations, and I wonder if this is what caused the
problem:
[{rabbit, [{vm_memory_high_watermark, 0}, {cluster_nodes,
['artemis','hermes']}]}].

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; higher than the 8GB of RAM available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me, this sounds like Rabbit was about to crash. Sadly, Erlang is very
</I>&gt;<i> very poor at string handling. When processes in Erlang crash, they have
</I>&gt;<i> their last known state, stacktrace, and &quot;last message in&quot; dumped to the
</I>&gt;<i> log. This is fantastic from a debugging pov, but Erlang is so awful at
</I>&gt;<i> converting all this data to a string to put into the log, that I
</I>&gt;<i> regularly see Erlang eat GBs of RAM, eventually running out and then
</I>&gt;<i> swapping to death when converting a few MB of state to a string. This
</I>&gt;<i> seems to match what happened to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, Rabbit certainly shouldn't have crashed, and we've had very few
</I>&gt;<i> crash reports with 2.5.1. It's possible that the logs contain at least
</I>&gt;<i> part of the reason for the crash, and if so, they'd help a lot. But
</I>&gt;<i> other than that there's very little for us to go on to try and help out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have the logs available and if they contain errors then they'd be
</I>&gt;<i> of great help. Has Rabbit been behaving itself since or did you
</I>&gt;<i> downgrade back to your previously known-good version?
