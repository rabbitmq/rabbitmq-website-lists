Hi Matthew,

Thanks for your response.

Yes, you are right. This happens when the nodes become unavailable.
I have reproduced the issue by breaking up the link between two nodes. 
The queue on node2 gets deleted when the node1 becomes unavailable. I 
was wrong saying the cluster_status commands shows that cluster is up 
and running. In fact, two nodes stay detached until stop_app/start_app 
executed.

I know that rabbitmq cluster is not designed to work on unreliable links 
but is it a correct behavior when a queue gets deleted from the node? At 
least the node should allow producer to re-create the queue and keep all 
the messages until connection between nodes is back up.
Is there any way to re-establish connection between two nodes when the 
link goes up?


Regards,
