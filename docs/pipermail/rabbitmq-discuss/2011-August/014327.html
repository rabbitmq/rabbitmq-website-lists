Where in the cycle do you wait for / process the publisher confirm?

Also, if you have a publishing rate of 6000Hz, but a consuming rate of 
1/0.8 = 1.25Hz, then you'll need thousands of consumers to keep up. 
Otherwise the number of messages in / disk usage of rabbit will just 
keep growing.

&gt;<i> I'm experiencing things like &quot;rabbitmq not giving a message to a

</I>
I suggest you use the management plug-in to get a better insight into
what rabbit is doing. Also look at the rabbit logs for anything unusual.

&gt;<i> RabbitMQ is also rather frequently dropping connections but I'm

</I>
RabbitMQ will only drop connections for the following reasons:

- an error occurred, in which case an error message sent to the client
(which you should see there and in the rabbit logs) and a connection
shutdown handshake sequence is initiated

- heartbeats are enabled and a client didn't send anything (including
heartbeat frames) for a while; there should be a message in the logs for
when that happens

Any other connection drops will be due to the client, network,
firewalls, etc.

&gt;<i> I also graphed the publish confirmations from RabbitMQ (actually the
</I>&gt;<i> number of unack'd messages remaining)
</I>
Those two are completely different things. Confirms relate to messages
published by the client to the broker, acks relate to messages delivered
by the broker to clients.


Regards,

Matthias.
