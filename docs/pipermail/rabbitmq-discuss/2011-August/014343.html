<PRE>&gt;<i> Is there a possibility to set the ReplyTimeout for the
</I>&gt;<i>  template.receive function? The template.setReplyTimeout is only for
</I>&gt;<i>  the template.sendAndReceive function.
</I>
There is a JIRA ticket for that
(<A HREF="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/AMQP-71,">https://jira.springsource.org/browse/AMQP-71,</A> resolved as Won't Fix).
We can't implement it without unintended consequences because there is
no concept of a blocking receive with timeout in the AMQP protocol

&gt;<i> But I need different Queues for sending an receiving.
</I>
sendAndReceive uses different queues for sending and receiving.

&gt;<i> By the way template.sendAndReceive isn't working anyway for me.
</I>
Can you be more specific?

&gt;<i> In addition my Queue is auto-delete and not durable, but it isn't
</I>&gt;<i> deleted after the last message is read.
</I>
Auto-delete queues are only removed when the Channel is closed (which
might be never if you use a CachingConnectionFactory.  You need an
exclusive queue to have it delete when not in use, and then you need
to use basicConsume, not basicGet to receive the message.  The whole
point of sendAdnReceive is to remove the burden of managing that.

&gt;<i> I get no compilation error, but these errors are very annoying.
</I>
There should be no XSD problems at runtime because Spring finds the
schema on the classpath.  From what you say this is the case.  So your
problem is in your XML editor, and all you need to do is find a way to
configure your editor to find the schema somewhere. how you do that
must depend on the editor.  If you use SpringSource ToolSuite it
should work (but you might need to use an explicit version number in
your schema declaration - i.e. */spring-rabbit-1.0.xsd).
