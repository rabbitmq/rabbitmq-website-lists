</I>&gt;<i> is known to have a fairly large negative impact on performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, I meant channel indeed.
I'm surprised to hear about the negative effect; in my experiments the
positive effect was very large - basically it raised a local stress
test throughput from several thousand to several hundred thousand
messages per second; can you please clarify?

&gt;&gt;<i> * Turn on autoAck
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> autoAck and basic.qos are mutually exclusive.
</I>That's good to know, too; thanks.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * In a cluster, always communicate with a queue only through the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> broker that first declared it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why do you say that?
</I>Because a queue physically exists on a single node, and accessing it
through a connection to another node causes indirect access and
traffic between the nodes; this is much slower.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Avoid frequently doing these things, esp. on a cluster: establishing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a connection, BasicConsume, QueueDeclare etc. If you do them often
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (dozens/hundreds of times per second), you're completely screwed. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conversely, if you're completely screwed, the first place to look is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether you're doing these things too frequently, and if you're not,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> look again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Connection establishment certainly can be a little expensive but you
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to do a few hundred a second fairly easily. Things that
</I>&gt;<i> hit queues when those queues are already busy can take some time
</I>&gt;<i> depending on the loading present on the queue. This is something we're
</I>&gt;<i> aware of and are trying to figure out how to solve.
</I>Yeah, I may be mistaken about connection establishment, so then the
blame is on QueueDeclare - an application of mine accidentally too
many reconnects and declares after each reconnect, and this led to all
sorts of horrible and unexplainable things.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Increase erlang process limit
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We do that by default, but certainly for large installations raising
</I>&gt;<i> that further may be necessary.
</I>I started encountering this on Windows, RabbitMQ 2.5.1 when going up
from 4k consumers to 5k :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Split one queue into many, as a queue can only utilize 1 core -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> across a cluster or not (either will give some benefit); publish in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> roundrobin (between those sub-queues that aren't overloaded acc. to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> publisher confirmations); consume all simultaneously.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, the problem with that is that your message stream may require some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of ordering guarantees and by publishing round-robin, you're going
</I>&gt;<i> to lose that. For some use cases though, this can be an effective
</I>&gt;<i> approach.
