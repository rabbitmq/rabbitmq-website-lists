<PRE>Hi Matthias,

&gt;<i> In the graceful closure case, do you terminate the consumers simultaneously or in parallel?
</I>
The consumers are terminated in parallel but not simultaneously (ie, there might be a few sec of difference between each terminations).

&gt;<i> Is there a difference between using one connection with 200k queues vs 10 connections with 20k queues each?
</I>
You might be on to something :).  I just ran my test client with one connection with 200k queue.  In this case, even with graceful shutdown, I am running into the auto-deleting issues.

&gt;<i> I have some idea of what might be going on, but it would help if you condensed your test into a single program - perhaps using multiple threads - and sent it to us. Thanks.
</I>
Sure, I can change my test code on Monday to make it multi-threaded.
Thanks,
Michael
