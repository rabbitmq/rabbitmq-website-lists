<PRE>Hi, Yu-Teh: 


The similarity you're speaking of doesn't run especially deep, and might even mislead you if you internalize it too thoroughly. 


You can, as you say, have many virtual hosts within a RabbitMQ server, but this is independent of the fact that you can cluster multiple RabbitMQ servers into a cooperating whole. 


Clustering involves the management of certain shared state across all of the Rabbit servers that participate in a cluster, but not all server state is shared (for example a given queue will exist only on one of the Rabbit servers in a cluster in the current implementation while the metadata used for maintaining users, exchanges, queues, bindings, and the like however is shared through Erlang's Mnesia database). 


Best regards, 
Jerry

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] what's the difference between virtual host and clustering 

According to the AMQP 0.9.1, the virtual host is a data partition within the server and it comprises its own name space, a set of exchanges, queues ..etc. 


I thought it just very similar to the clustering which combine many erlang node together. 


Or can I say that they are under different layer of abstraction. Once you combine many rabbitmq erlang node together, it is called cluster. 


And if you want to isolate no matter a single node or cluster into different partition, it is called virtual host. 


Is my understanding right? 


Thanks 



Shen, Yu-Teh
