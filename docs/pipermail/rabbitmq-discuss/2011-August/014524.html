<PRE>Hi Eugene,

No problem. I rather enjoy trying to track down such bugs.

&gt;<i> Do you refer to reproducing the INTERNAL_ERROR bug in tx.commit (which
</I>&gt;<i> only happened once and didn't cause a node crash), or to the bug that
</I>&gt;<i> was causing the node crash (and happened on a different node of the
</I>&gt;<i> cluster)?
</I>
Well, a msg_store on a node crashed when one of the queues that was
using it was deleted. The crash of said msg_store subsequently took out
all other queues that were using that msg_store. The loss of those
queues would have caused all in-flight tx.commits to abort with an
INTERNAL_ERROR.

So I strongly suspect they're all one and the same thing.

&gt;<i> By the way, I ran the stress test with even more stress on the cluster
</I>&gt;<i> several times afterwards and wasn't able to cause it to crash again,
</I>&gt;<i> though before that 2 of 2 tests crashed. So I was &quot;lucky&quot; in a sense.
</I>
All the best bugs have this property :D
