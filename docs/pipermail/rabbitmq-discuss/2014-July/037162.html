See&#160;<A HREF="http://markmail.org/thread/afp5d774qrnx6ukh#query:+page:1+mid:zklpftnv3pce5qzz+state:results.">http://markmail.org/thread/afp5d774qrnx6ukh#query:+page:1+mid:zklpftnv3pce5qzz+state:results.</A>

Reordering is performed by the message store.
If a message goes straight to the consumer, no reordering will be done.
