<PRE>Both users have the administrator tag, and have been give full access to that vhost, yet both get different results.  My usual admin account gets access denied, where guest just hangs.  That's what I'm trying to figure out - the closest I've gotten to an error message is that traceback.

Thanks,
Kale

It's not possible to tell without seeing what RabbitMQ logs when it happens.

You can use any user that has the administrator tag and access to the vhost.
