No, no, no!

(And this is why writing documentation is hard! At least for me.)

I somewhat oversimplified. What really happens is that the queue will 
choose to do work that relates to consumers rather than publishers as 
long as:

1) The queue is running flat out; it never has any idle time.
2) The queue actually has work to do that pertains to consuming.
3) Messages are being consumed at less than 110% of the rate they're 
being published.

In the case you describe above, 2) will be false 99% of the time, at 
which point the queue will accept publishes as fast as it can.

In other words, when I said &quot;if consumers and producers are both going 
as fast as they can&quot; I meant if the limiting factor is the queue itself, 
not whatever work they're doing.

I hope that is clearer this time round.

&gt;<i> I'd assume then that'd propagate up to the publisher if
</I>&gt;<i> there's a chain of rabbit servers all running 3.3 - e.g. the code
</I>&gt;<i> publish to rabbit which shovels to the remote rabbit where the code
</I>&gt;<i> consumer runs.  In this case the code publisher would get back pressure
</I>&gt;<i> that'd reduce it's publish rate to ~72msgs/second?
</I>
Which would be a disaster. It's meant to be a queuing system, after all :-)

Cheers, Simon
