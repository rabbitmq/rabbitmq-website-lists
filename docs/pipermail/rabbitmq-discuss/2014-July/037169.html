</I>
I can see that some may expect unroutable messages
to be nack-ed but RabbitMQ cannot know whether that's the case: in some cases
it's fine for messages to not be routed anywhere. So acks verify a bunch of things:

&#160;1. Your connection is alive
&#160;2. Your channel is still open (no exceptions)
&#160;3. Routed message was delivered to all queue mirrors (if applicable)

Using a nack to indicate that the message is unroutable would confuse a lot
of apps into thinking that 1) or 2) were not true.


&gt;<i> If this implementation is by design &#8211; could you suggest a way in  
</I>&gt;<i> which we
</I>&gt;<i> can implement guaranteed delivery, i.e.:
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Confirm that the message has not only reached the broker, but  
</I>&gt;<i> has been
</I>&gt;<i> processed by one or more queues.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Throw a nack, or generate an exception when the message cannot  
</I>&gt;<i> be routed
</I>&gt;<i> and that the message has been persisted to disk
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Making blocking calls to our publishes in the ReturnListener  
</I>&gt;<i> implementation when we are trying to write to such queues?
</I>
Group messages in batches if you can. Then
publish a batch, use Channel#waitForConfirms. If it returns false, schedule
the batch for re-publishing. If a return arrives, do the same.
You'll also need to have a way to identify messages, but this is generally true
with confirms.

Batching will provide good throughput with easier to use but generally slower API (#waitForConfirms vs. ConfirmListener).&#160;

Because basic.return may arrive after #waitForConfirms returns, you may want to schedule
a &quot;batch check&quot; that runs in a few seconds and completely marks the batch as successfully
delivered.

&gt;<i> Follow up question: If a queue process being killed is the only  
</I>&gt;<i> criterion
</I>&gt;<i> for ConfirmListener.handleNack being called &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t an  
</I>&gt;<i> undeclared/currently unavailable queue result in handleNack  
</I>&gt;<i> being called.
</I>&gt;<i> Our suspicion is that the message which cannot be routed to a currently  
</I>&gt;<i> unavailable queue is handled like an unroutable message, which  
</I>&gt;<i> is confirmed
</I>&gt;<i> immediately after basic.return but is also &#8216;ACK&#8217;ed, which seems  
</I>&gt;<i> counter-intuitive.
</I>
Can you expand on how exactly your experiment was conducted? Did you receive
an ack for a message routed to a queue whose master was unavailable? Was it the only
queue the message was routed to?&#160;
