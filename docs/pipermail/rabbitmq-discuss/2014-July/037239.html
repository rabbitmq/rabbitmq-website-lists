<PRE>So, I'm working on cleaning up some old data and vhosts around a 3.2.1 cluster, and I'm running into some weird things.  When I run rabbitmqadmin delete parameter -component=federation name=local-nodename (or local-username) -V vhostname, if I use the -username -password prompts I get access denied.  So I temporarily re-added guest/guest and gave it access to the vhost in question, and it hung.  Like, over lunch hung.  I hit ctrl-c when I got back and got this traceback:
^CTraceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/usr/local/bin/rabbitmqadmin&quot;, line 939, in &lt;module&gt;
    main()
  File &quot;/usr/local/bin/rabbitmqadmin&quot;, line 380, in main
    method()
  File &quot;/usr/local/bin/rabbitmqadmin&quot;, line 560, in invoke_delete
    self.delete(uri)
  File &quot;/usr/local/bin/rabbitmqadmin&quot;, line 412, in delete
    return self.http(&quot;DELETE&quot;, &quot;/api%s&quot; % path, &quot;&quot;)
  File &quot;/usr/local/bin/rabbitmqadmin&quot;, line 432, in http
    resp = conn.getresponse()
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py&quot;, line 1030, in getresponse
    response.begin()
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py&quot;, line 407, in begin
    version, status, reason = self._read_status()
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py&quot;, line 365, in _read_status
    line = self.fp.readline()
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py&quot;, line 430, in readline
    data = recv(1)
KeyboardInterrupt

I've seen some issues with deleting vhosts in earlier versions - is that still an issue with this version?  Am I doing something wrong with the command?  Is there a reason I can't feed it an account with similar access to the guest account and have it at least give me the same result?

Thanks for any information or insight you can provide,
Kale
