Cool!

No, it's not the same.

All released versions only give you a single switch, 
force_fine_statistics (not very well named) which switches all message 
rate statistics on and off.

The next release will rename this as follows:

   {force_fine_statistics, false} -&gt; {rates_mode, none}
   {force_fine_statistics, true}  -&gt; {rates_mode, detailed}

but will also have a new option (which will be the default):

   {rates_mode, basic}

In this mode management will display global message rates as well as 
rates for individual channels / exchanges / queues, but not for 
combinations of those objects. So for example you'll be able to see that 
a queue is accepting 5000 msg/s and delivering 6000 msg/s, but you won't 
be able to see which exchanges those messages came from and which 
channels those messages went to; i.e. the pane labelled &quot;Message rates 
breakdown&quot; in the web UI.

I think those detailed message rates are fairly rarely-used (in fact I 
suspect a lot of people don't realise they exist), so it makes sense to 
disable them by default. The upside is a large saving of RAM for use 
cases like yours, and some saving of CPU.

Cheers, Simon
