<PRE>Michael,

Thanks for the update. Can you be a little more specific about the
set-up that fails?

In particular I would like to know:

-  the version of Erlang you are using, and the (v)hardware you are
   running RabbitMQ on (a copy of the startup log would be nice);

-  if the problem is noticed on a non-ssl connection (if you can try
   this) -- we haven't seen this particular problem on our tests;

-  are there any messages in the rabbitmq log around the time the
   message delivery stops?

-  can you provide more details about the topic subscription --
   is this a durable subscription, for example;

-  and do the acknowledgements actually get through (you can tell this
   if messages you think you have consumed are redelivered on
   reconnect)?

We have recently discovered (and fixed) a bug in the STOMP client that
will stop the broker seeing the last message sent (under load). It is
possible that, if pre-fetch is set to 1, this is causing you to jam
up -- the STOMP code may not be detecting your last acknowledgement. To
confirm this, please try this with a pre-fetch count of zero (or 2 or
more) and see if you still get the lock-up.

I hope we can get to the bottom of this.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Steve,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem seems to be OS specific - today I received confirmation that RabbitMQ with stomp+ssl works on a Linux box in the Amazon EC2 cloud with my client library, which is written in Delphi.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To confirm this, I will run a test with RabbitMQ 2.8.2 running on a Ubuntu 11.10 system in the next days.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The test tool uses a topic destination. There has not been any message loss, only a stop of message delivery after two to three seconds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The tool also uses client ack mode, so the client not only listens but also sends data over the SSL socket for every message, so I assume that the reason for stopped message delivery is not 'missing traffic' on the wire.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you like to test it, could upload the test tool to my web space - it is a self-contained executable which only needs the OpenSSL libraries in the system path to run.
</I>&gt;<i>
