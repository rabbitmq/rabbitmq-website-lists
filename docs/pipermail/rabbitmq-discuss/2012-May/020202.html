That seems to be taken out of context, it's probably not an answer to the question
you're asking.

&gt;<i> which I doubt is true. In the tutorials, a consumer/worker program listens to the queue, and process messages as they arrive, without using celery.

Celery is a system that responds to messages by calling Python functions,
it is heavily biased around the concept of tasks and workflows, and so may
not be suitable for all messaging scenarios.

Writing a consumer is not hard, writing one that keeps running is.
The celery worker is heavily used in production and supports many features:
<A HREF="http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html">http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html</A>

And then the system must also be maintained, and your sysadmin
will probably hug you for using something standard that is
documented and has a supporting community. 

The next version 2.6 will extend on the concept of subtasks, but
the documentation is only a rough draft:
