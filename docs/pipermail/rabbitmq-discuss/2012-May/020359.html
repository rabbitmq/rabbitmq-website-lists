Aha!  Serendipitous.

Could you try reverting to prefetch=1 with this user's code fixed? If it
works, it would confirm our understanding of your symptoms, and it would
&gt;<i> not&lt; be related to our own discovered bug.

Thanks,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it is the problem I think it is, then yes, but your question makes me

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this, but your use of the word 'instead' got me worried. :-)
