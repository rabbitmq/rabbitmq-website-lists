I'm glad it makes sense.

</I>
Yes. If you have a prefetch of 2, and a message can take up to 15
seconds to process, then you could potentially have a message buffered in
the client for nearly 15 seconds. If that's unacceptable (i.e. doesn't
meet your definition of ASAP) then a prefetch of 1 will be better. Given
the relative ratios of processing time and network latency, it seems
likely to me a very low prefetch is the right thing to do there.
