<PRE>Hello, Simon.

Thank you for looking at this. Please see inline.

Sure. Please look at attached file. It contains the source code that I runs. It can be compiled using rebar.
Here is short explanation for the code:
apps -&gt;
	common - library module. It contains connection pool, publisher and consumer worker modules. I use connection pool since I also do testing for RabbitMQ cluster.
	consumer - Consumer app. It's kinda stupid app with one supervisor to start consumer workers and API helpers functions. See consumer.erl
	publisher - Publisher app. It's same as the consumer app. There is API module as well (publisher.erl)
lib -&gt;
	rabbit_common
	amqp_client 

All code is pretty straight forward. Connection pool accepts URLs and amount of connections per URL. It works in Round-Robin mode. Publisher does &quot;basic.publish&quot; and Consumer uses subscription. 

I will continue digging it. What's odd for me RabbitMQ does &quot;Flow control&quot; when it seems to be fine: Memory and CPU are low on RabbitMQ node. It looks like there is no reason to do &quot;flow control&quot;. 

P.S. RabbitMQ node is VM with 8 CPUs and 4Gb memory.
