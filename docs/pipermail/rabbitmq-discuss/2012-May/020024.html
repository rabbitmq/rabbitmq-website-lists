I assume that must be very old sample code? AMQP 0-8 originally 
introduced the idea of a ticket as a token generated by the server 
representing a cached set of permissions after you had logged in. Or 
something, it was a rather dubious idea.

It was deprecated in 0-9-1 and RabbitMQ &gt;= 2.0.0 will ignore it even 
when talking AMQP 0-8. Your client API should have removed references to 
it by now, but if you are using an elderly client for some reason, just 
pass 0.

Cheers, Simon
