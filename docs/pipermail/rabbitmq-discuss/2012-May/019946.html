<PRE>Hi Lucas,

If there are consumers listening to a queue with fewer messages
unacknowledged than their own pre-fetch count, then the broker will
deliver a message to one of those consumers (if there is one to
deliver).

It is not possible to tell RabbitMQ to limit total deliveries to many
consumers at once (though I suppose that might be useful).

You do not say when a message received by a consumer is acknowledged,
though if it is consistency you need I assume this happens only when the
message has been 'processed' in some way.

If there were one consumer per queue, the messages could be dispatched
from that consumer to workers (for processing) with acks sent only when
the required processing for each message is completed.

If you wish these other workers could be listening to their own queues,
though it might be tricky to load-balance dispatching based upon whether
they are busy or not.

&gt;<i> Maybe I was thinking with the wrong abstractions, and I could, inside
</I>&gt;<i> the same queue, guarantee the serial delivery of the messages based on
</I>&gt;<i> some logic attribute in the message header, like &quot;no message with
</I>&gt;<i> attribute X will be delivered if there is an unacknowledged message
</I>&gt;<i> with this same attribute X&quot;. Is that possible?
</I>
You appear to want to select messages from a queue based upon some
criterion. I believe this is not possible. The only message you can
ever consume from a queue is the one at the front.
