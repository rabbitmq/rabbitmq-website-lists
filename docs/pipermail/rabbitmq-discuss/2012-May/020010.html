So there is no way to preempt the cert retrieval, other than altering 
the machine-wide policy? That seems like a major omission in the .net 
SSL API. Having every connection take 15+ seconds to get established may 
be ok in your particular app but could be a showstopper in many other cases.

&gt;<i> To get around this, we would just need the timeout (pointed out by Emile -

</I>&gt;<i> to be relaxed to 20 seconds.  This would give the client enough time to wait
</I>&gt;<i> for the Windows 15 second delay, verify the certificate, and allow the SSL
</I>&gt;<i> connection to be established.
</I>
As Emile mentioned, there are actually two timeouts:

1) ssl upgrade. This covers the upgrading of the tcp connection to ssl 
and should include all ssl handshaking. It's set to 5 seconds.

2) AMQP connection establishment. This covers the entire AMQP connection 
establishment handshake. It is set to 10 seconds and starts *after* the 
ssl upgrade has been completed.


 From the description of the problem I would expect you to encounter the 
*first* timeout, which result in a &quot;error on AMQP connection ...: 
&lt;Reason&gt;&quot; message in the logs. However, you said you are seeing a 
handshake_timeout error, which is raised by the *second* timeout. That 
is weird. Are you sure that is the error you saw?


Regards,

Matthias.
