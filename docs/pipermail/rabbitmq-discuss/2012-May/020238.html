<PRE>Jos&#233;,

Thank you for all the investigation you are doing. I have caught up and
yesterday convinced myself that it is indeed our bug. The Wireshark
traces confirm that all the messages are actually sent. I have produced
my own version of your testcase with numbered messages to test which
ones fail to get through. I've also ended the app with a DISCONNECT, but
still we lose one of the messages.

I'm going to look more closely at the STOMP stuff, and have raised a bug
(24957) to track this internally. I'll get back to you as soon as I find
out where this is getting lost.

Incidentally, it is apparently the last message in a packet that is not
being picked up, and it is not obvious why this should be so. Putting
the DISCONNECT on the end I thought would cure it, but it didn't; which
is very strange. Of course, I don't wait for a receipt on the
DISCONNECT; but closing too soon is not the problem.
