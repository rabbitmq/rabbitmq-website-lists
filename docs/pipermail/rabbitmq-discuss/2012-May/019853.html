That's how *mirrored queues* work. Mirrored queues are a feature that 
you can use when clustering, but they're not the only thing.

&gt;<i> That means that the cluster's write/read performance is only as fast as

</I>&gt;<i> and starts lagging further and further behind from the remote brokers?
</I>
Just to be clear here, when you say &quot;remote brokers&quot; you are planning to 
connect them with federation / shovel to a central cluster? Clustering 
over a WAN is not recommended - see <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/distributed.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/distributed.html</A>

&gt;<i> Does it mean I need to set up another independent cluster with it's own
</I>&gt;<i> master to deal with it?
</I>
I'm not sure what this means.

&gt;<i> If I'm still on the right path there is no real advantage to have more
</I>&gt;<i> than 2 nodes in a cluster if all you need to do is consume from the
</I>&gt;<i> cluster and have a failover if something goes wrong as all consumes

</I>
Yes, if you're just aiming to have redundancy in your queues. But you 
might want to have a cluster with lots of non-mirrored queues 
distributed around the cluster - in that case you would add more nodes 
to get more capacity.

(You can also have mirrored queues on a subset of cluster nodes to 
achieve the same goal, but the mechanism for doing that is currently a 
bit awkward.)

Cheers, Simon
