There is nothing more permanent than temporary solutions in software.
We cannot later tell our commercial customers &quot;you know guys, that feature
that your app is built on, it was temporary. Good luck with upgrading!&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt; * It may also run into limitations in SockJS
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> What kind of limitations do you mean here?
</I>
I can't name any specific one without trying to implement the thing but
I assure you APIs don't always provide exactly what you want :)

&gt;<i> &gt; So I'd recommend combining HTTPS connection with credentials  
</I>&gt;<i> obtained from an HTTPS endpoint in your JS application.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> We have considered this approach, however the problem is that  
</I>&gt;<i> the JS code initiating the websocket connection runs in the user's  
</I>&gt;<i> web browser, and this makes such kind of solutions rather insecure.  
</I>&gt;<i> On the other side using client certificate data for authentication  
</I>&gt;<i> is both secure and happens completely transparently to the end-user.  
</I>
HTTPS should give you a reasonable protection from tampering and MITM.
Making your credentials user-specific and &quot;tokens&quot; that you use to obtain
&quot;real&quot; credentials ephemeral should protect reasonably well from malicious
users.

&gt;<i> So, I'd be very grateful if you could take a closer look at the solution  
</I>&gt;<i> I've previously suggested and provide some hints on which changes  
</I>&gt;<i> should be applied to the sockjs-erlang-wrapper and web-stomp  
</I>&gt;<i> source in order to implement it.. unfortunately I'm having a  
</I>&gt;<i> bit of a hard time figuring out where exactly to add that additional  
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP header processing code..
</I>
Your plan involves using basic HTTP authentication. How is this really
more secure than using temporary tokens to programmatically obtain a pair
of credentials?&#160;

&gt;<i> Another issue I ran into playing with this is an error showing  
</I>&gt;<i> up when trying to compile the original web-stomp plugin from  
</I>&gt;<i> the rabbitmq-public-umbrella:
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> ../cowboy-wrapper/cowboy-git/src/cowboy_clock.erl: undefined  
</I>&gt;<i> parse transform 'eunit_autoexport'
</I>&gt;<i> make: *** [../cowboy-wrapper/ebin/cowboy_clock.beam] Error  
</I>&gt;<i> 1
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Could you please shed some light on this? I've checked out the  
</I>&gt;<i> latest rabbitmq-public-umbrella and my Erlang version is R16B02.  
</I>
What were the exact steps you performed? R16B02 should be plenty sufficient
for Cowboy and Rabbit. To build web-stomp, clone the umbrella, `make up` in it,
then cd rabbitmq-web-stomp and run `make`.

&gt;<i> &gt; P.S.: Although you have CCd rabbitmq-discuss group in the previous  
</I>&gt;<i> messages, somehow these are not visible to me on the Rabbitmq-discuss  
</I>&gt;<i> Google Group. Are there some viewing or access restrictions  
</I>&gt;<i> set up?
</I>
The Google group is just a way for start a conversation
w/o signing up. Join rabbitmq-discuss proper.
