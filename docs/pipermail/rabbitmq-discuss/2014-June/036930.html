<PRE>Hi all,



We just upgraded from 3.2.1 to 3.3.4 and federation died on us.  Looking at the cluster, it appears some... overenthusiastic dev renamed the cluster, and now when federation creates new linkages, it creates them as clustername:vHost:queue, rather than usertoken:vHost:queue.  Also, on the federation upstreams, the parameter field seems to have vanished, so I can't update the user tokens for specific vHosts.  I've been going through the patch notes - is this intentional, or is something else going on?  And can I just remove the cluster name?  I've tried deleting the old dynamically created fed stuff so that it gets recreated, but the new stuff just doesn't seem to work.  Any help is appreciated.
