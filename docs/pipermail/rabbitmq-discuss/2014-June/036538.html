<PRE>Mike,


&gt;&gt;<i> How is the NuGet package going to be updated?
</I>
&gt;<i> Good question. If WinRT is an incompatible target, does it mean
</I>&gt;<i> there should be 2 packages, X and X-winrt, for example?
</I>
Different platform DLLs go in a named folders inside of the NuGet package.
 Everything is delivered together and Visual Studio links to the correct
DLL.  If it was possible to build the NuGet package as part of the CI
process, that would be the best.  Currently the NuGet creation lives
elsewhere and is manually populated with the release binaries.

&gt;<i> Is it technically possible to run the current NUnit test suite
</I>&gt;<i> on WinRT? Protocol configuration is removed in default and 3.4 will only
</I>&gt;<i> support one protocol (0-9-1). Do we still need to worry about using MSTest
</I>&gt;<i> then?
</I>
NUnit was able to test it without the configuration part.  I can remove
that and remove all the MSTest changes.  The test runner then works as a
desktop process (on Windows 8/Server 2012).

&gt;<i> If your branch is in Mercurial or Git somewhere, we can work on it until
</I>it's
&gt;<i> mostly done, then create a bug and pull it into the mainline.
</I>
Anyone can pull it from Bitbucket
&lt;<A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/nathanbrown/rabbitmq-dotnet-client">https://bitbucket.org/nathanbrown/rabbitmq-dotnet-client</A>&gt;right now.  I can
continue to work there.

Thanks,
Nathan Brown

</I>&gt;<i> First of all, thank you for working on this. It would be great to have

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There are a couple issues that still need to be worked through:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can the CI build be on a Windows 8/Server 2012 machine? Or is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; build going to have to be ran separately just for this DLL?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't tested SSL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This needs to happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The unit tests are currently partially ported to MSTest, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this is primarily because of reading WinRT configuration data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't work on the desktop, I think I should drop that entirely
