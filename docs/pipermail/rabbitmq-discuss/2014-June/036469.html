Ultimately, it's a market, not a planned economy :-)

RabbitMQ will support AMQP 1.0 to the extent that the market demands it. 
You are right to say that the 1.0 plugin has seen little development 
since its release: that's simply because we haven't heard back from 
anyone who's using it. If AMQP 1.0 takes off, RabbitMQ users will not be 
left behind.

(Is anyone out there using it? Please tell us if you are!)

I would argue that &quot;ISO standard&quot; and &quot;industry standard&quot; are two 
different things. TCP/IP is an industry standard, the OSI networking 
stack is an ISO standard, even though no-one uses it.
