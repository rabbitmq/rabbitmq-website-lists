While I'm not very familiar with how the pause process works, there is an inherent race
condition between the decision to pause itself and incoming messages that are confirmed.

Once a node decides to pause, there may be messages &quot;in flight&quot; that were already
read from the socket and parsed, and being delivered to queues. These processes
(in both general and Erlang sense) can run in parallel on machines with over 1 core.

I'm not sure there is a one-size-fits-all solution on the server end. Try publishing
batches of messages and wait for confirms for a batch (and not a single message).
Then you'll have to re-try with batches, too, which means if a part of the earlier
batch was lost due to the race condition explained above, they will be retried.

And batching is a recommended practice with publisher confirms anyway.&#160;
