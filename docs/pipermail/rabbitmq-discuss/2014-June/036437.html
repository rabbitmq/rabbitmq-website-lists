Yes, it takes time for both RabbitMQ and client libraries to detect
connection failure. This is in part due to how TCP works. You can configure
the interval of inactivity for RabbitMQ nodes:

<A HREF="https://www.rabbitmq.com/nettick.html">https://www.rabbitmq.com/nettick.html</A>

and use a low (say, 1-3 seconds) heartbeat interval for client libraries.
This should make the exception be thrown much earlier (given that your client
supports it; Pika should) at the cost of having increased network traffic:

<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/reliability.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/reliability.html</A>

Beyond that, your apps can publish last N messages (excessively) after a network
failure. If your consumers can de-duplicate them (e.g. every message has an id you can set),
that should work well.

If that's not the case, there is a trick that some companies do: they run a RabbitMQ
node local to machine (which at least greatly reduces the probability of RabbitMQ becoming
unreachable), publish with publisher confirms and a low heartbeat interval to the local
node and use Federation [1] or Shovel [2] to connect that node to other nodes.

By the way, there are only two official clients: Java and .NET.
