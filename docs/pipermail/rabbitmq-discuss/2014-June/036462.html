<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Having finally demonstrated to my company that RabbitMQ and AMQP allow us 
to build kickass distributed solutions, I am now getting strong pressure to 
move off RabbitMQ to &quot;something more modern that supports AMQP 1.0&quot;.  I 
understand that 0.9.1 and 1.0 are completely different beasts, and that 
there's a 1.0 protocol plugin for RabbitMQ, but that plugin has limitations 
and things in 1.0 that it does not support.  The Powers That Be at the 
company look at IBM and Microsoft having AMQP 1.0 support and saying that's 
clearly where we need to be if we want to (a) not be left behind, and (b) 
advertise that we're using &quot;the industry standard&quot;.

Since there's no indication that RabbitMQ will ever support a 
fully-compliant 1.0 mode, do any of you have suggestions for how I can 
demonstrate that staying on RabbitMQ for new development is a good idea?

Thanks!
