<PRE>Hi Michael,

Thanks for the info. Not sure why I couldn't find those pages on your website.

I will pass this info on to our hosting provider. Hopefully they will shed some light on it.

Cheers

Chris

Network partitions can be asymmetrical: node A can connect to B but B can't connect to A. Or they don't detect connectivity loss at the same time. So this is not necessarily an indication of something unusual .
