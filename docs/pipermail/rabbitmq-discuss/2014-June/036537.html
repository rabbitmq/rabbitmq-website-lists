Nathan,

First of all, thank you for working on this. It would be great to have
WinRT support in the .NET client!

&gt;<i> &gt; There are a couple issues that still need to be worked through:  
</I>&gt;<i> Can the CI build be on a Windows 8/Server 2012 machine? Or is the  
</I>&gt;<i> build going to have to be ran separately just for this DLL?
</I>
Windows CI currently uses Windows XP. We'll see if adding more
Windows versions is easy enough, and in particular Windows 8.

&gt;<i> How is the NuGet package going to be updated?
</I>
Good question. If WinRT is an incompatible target, does it mean
there should be 2 packages, X and X-winrt, for example?

&gt;<i> I haven't tested SSL.
</I>
This needs to happen.

&gt;<i> The unit tests are currently partially ported to MSTest, but  
</I>&gt;<i> this is primarily because of reading WinRT configuration data  
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't work on the desktop, I think I should drop that entirely  
</I>&gt;<i> (Protocols.FromConfiguration(string)).
</I>
Is it technically possible to run the current NUnit test suite
on WinRT? Protocol configuration is removed in default and 3.4 will only
support one protocol (0-9-1). Do we still need to worry about using MSTest
then?

I don't have a bug number to give but we also don't need one.
If your branch is in Mercurial or Git somewhere, we can work on it until it's
mostly done, then create a bug and pull it into the mainline.&#160;
