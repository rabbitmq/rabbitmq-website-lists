</I>That's interesting. It looks like an older version of rabbitmq

      {rabbit,&quot;RabbitMQ&quot;,&quot;3.0.0&quot;},

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you want is &quot;rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node --offline&quot;. This will:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Allow you to tell node1 or node2 that node3 has left the cluster

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Reset node1 or node2's idea of which nodes were the last to shut down,
</I>&gt;<i> allowing the cluster to start again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node --offline&quot; is currently a bit of a pain
</I>&gt;<i> to use, since you have to start an Erlang node without booting RabbitMQ.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can do this by adding &quot;NODE_ONLY=true&quot; to /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf
</I>&gt;<i> on node1 or node2. Attempting to start RabbitMQ in whatever's the normal
</I>&gt;<i> way for you will get an Erlang node started without RabbitMQ (i.e. as if
</I>&gt;<i> you'd successfully booted the server then invoked &quot;rabbitmqctl stop_app&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can now invoke &quot;rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node --offline node3&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once you've done that, you can stop your node, remove NODE_ONLY=true and
</I>&gt;<i> it should start correctly. The other disc node should then be able to start
</I>&gt;<i> up and join the cluster without further fiddling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Now thats interesting! Having an erlang node up without having to start up
rabbit sounds very useful. I tried doing forgetting the cluster node and
got this:

sudo rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node --offline <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at node3</A>

Error: not_last_node_to_go_down: The node you are trying to remove from was
not the last to go down (excluding the node you are removing). Please use
the the last node to go down to remove nodes when the cluster is offline.

I got the same error when I tried the same command with each of the other
nodes. So it looks like rabbit has no idea which node was the last to die.
Is it possible to ask rabbit for this information, possibly by groveling
around mnesia with &quot;rabbitmqctl eval&quot;?

I'm also okay with a drastic solution like &quot;blow away the mnesia database
and recover the data in some other way&quot;. Part of the reason I'm asking all
these questions is because I want to learn more about rabbitmq
