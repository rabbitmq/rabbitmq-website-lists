<PRE>I realised I botched what I said in my previous post a little bit with
respect to exchanges and such..

Basically, we want to know how much data's going into and out of rabbit and
how often, down to the individual destinations of a given message (perhaps
not always providing/recording this data until monitoring is specifically
required, or otherwise, as part of a debug mode if it proves to be a
significant load issue).

As sometimes a program might fail to consume messages or similar, as far as
I can tell, this kind of data could only be reliably determined from within
rabbit, as rabbit is the one doing the message routing.

Google found this:
&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/ManagementAndMonitoring">https://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/ManagementAndMonitoring</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The above page is dated 21st July, 2008. Has there been any developments
with internal RabbitMQ traffic metrics/statistics since then beyond being
able to obtain a &quot;snapshot&quot; of queue behaviour at a given time from rabbit
itself?
