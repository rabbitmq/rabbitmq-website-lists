file_handle_cache.erl was rewritten completely in bug21673 and my
workaround became irrelevant for it.

I've tried (rev 8f9f7b0177e6) and crashed it. Test scenario was to
create 4 non-transactional producers without consumers, each producer
was about to send 1m messages with size 10kbytes each.

./scripts/rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages_unacknowledged
messages memory consumers
Listing queues ...
mail.active     0       36414   51855936        0
...done.

Queue disappeared after storing ~40000 messages, client started to
receive returned messages with replyCode 312, replyText 'unroutable',
routingKey mail.active.

./scripts/rabbitmqctl list_queues name messages_unacknowledged
messages memory consumers
Listing queues ...
...done.

And then erlang died with message:
Crash dump was written to: erl_crash.dump
eheap_alloc: Cannot allocate 1824525600 bytes of memory (of type &quot;old_heap&quot;).
Aborted

See attached file for crash logs.

Here is small documentation patch for rabbitmqctl list_queues name
storage_mode replying with Error: {bad_argument,storage_mode}
