<PRE>Hi Matthew,

Many thanks for the response below, I will most certainly give it a try and
will let you know soon.

Windows sucks but unfortunately I have to use it for now ;-)

Chat later

Hi Lynton,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

Right, that, it turns out, was an issue with quoting paths under Windows
which exists in 1.7.0 and has since been fixed. Thus rabbitmq-server
default branch no longer has this bug.

Under Windows? I suspect you may be the first!

&gt;<i> Any other possibilities? All I want is to get BQL running ;-)
</I>
Right, I have fixed the bug on the BQL plugin. Unfortunately it has yet
to be QA'd and so it's not on the default branch. At this point, because
of the above bug, the only possible solution under Windows is to run the
default branch of rabbitmq-server and the bab71e658da2 revision of BQL.
I believe that *should* work under Windows. I'm afraid that for reasons
of sanity, none of us develop here under Windows which explains,
although does not excuse, how these problems arose.

Please let us know how you get on.

Matthew
