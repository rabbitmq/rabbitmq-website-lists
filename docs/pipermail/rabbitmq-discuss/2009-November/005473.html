That's odd. However, you're really much much better off using
queue.declare to redeclare the existing queue - the declare-ok that you
get back contains the number of messages in the queue. This is a much
neater strategy than below. I would recommend you switch to using this
and repeat your test.

</I>
That's a dangerous thing to do as it may change message order - the
message that is reinserted into the queue as a result of the absence of
the ack and the disconnect is not guaranteed to be placed at the head of
the queue - it may very likely be placed at the tail of the queue
instead.
