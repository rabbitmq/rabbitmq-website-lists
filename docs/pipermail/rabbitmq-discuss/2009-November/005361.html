<PRE>Hi Stephen,

Thanks for the patch, and for digging around enough to come up with a
solution.

That's fine. I have to say that it's unlikely this patch will make it
through - the memory management code has gone through a lot of change
recently as we're getting a much better handle on resource management.
Whilst you've obviously been working from the head of our default branch
(many thanks!), there are a couple of issues with garbage collecting
every process like that, for example, it's possible that garbage
collecting vast numbers of processes will take longer than the
memory_check_interval, making messages queue up for the memory manager
process. This would become a problem if the garbage collection is unable
to reclaim any memory at all - eg millions of queues, all of which are
empty.

&gt;<i> As far as overall system effects go, I haven't noticed any (aside from the

</I>&gt;<i> Are there any performance unit tests that I can run to check this?
</I>
Yeah, when you garbage collect a process it stops the process. Also, I
*believe* that Erlang uses a generational garbage collector. Normally,
it'll most likely only sweep the young generation, which should be
quick, but I suspect that manually calling garbage_collect will do a
full sweep of all generations, thus potentially taking longer. You may
find that this causes performance to dip.

We tend to measure using the java client. If you get that, and then ant
dist, and then cd build/dist, then start up rabbit and try:

sh runjava.sh com.rabbitmq.examples.MulticastMain -r 20000 -s 0 -a

On my machine, I can bump that 20000 to about 25000 and the sending
rates and receiving rates are about equal (i.e. the queue length doesn't
grow too much). Obviously your hardware may be different, but I suspect
that garbage collection may have a performance impact, obviously
depending on how often it's done. With the default memory_check_interval
of 1 sec, my guess is that it'd be noticeable.

Much better resource management is on its way. However, if your patch
works for you then obviously, please use it.

Matthew
