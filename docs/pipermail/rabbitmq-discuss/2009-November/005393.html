I know nothing about Bunny, but RabbitMQ uses the same version of AMQP
(0.8) as 1.6.0 and 1.5.x did, so client libraries ought to be
compatible.  Are you sure that Bunny isn't compatible with 1.7.0?

I can understand your reluctance to upgrade in the face of a deadline,
but an number of bugs have been addressed between 1.5.x and 1.7.0, so
you should plan to upgrade when possible.

&gt;<i> You say that it sounds like the &quot;prevent timeouts when server is busy&quot;. What
</I>&gt;<i> defines &quot;busy&quot; here? Is that when the server is in the middle of something

</I>
Prior to 1.7.0, rabbitmq had a second timeout on RPC calls to RabbitMQ
server processes.  For some operations, with the server under heavy
load, this timeout could be exceeded, causing intermittent failures.

However, I've looked back at the relevant change, and I see that the
old timeout was 30 seconds, which doesn't correspond to the delay of 5
seconds you describe.
