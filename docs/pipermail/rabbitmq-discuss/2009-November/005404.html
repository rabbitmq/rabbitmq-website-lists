The redirection stuff has gone from AMQP 0.9.1 so there's not a huge
need to worry about it if you're just experimenting for the time being.
The idea is that in a cluster, a node can request that you change the
connection to a different node, for load balancing reasons. The Java and
.Net clients both detect these errors and attempt to obey the
redirection requests.

&gt;<i> &gt; Well <A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">client at m1</A> died. This means its subscriptions to Q were lost - there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is no concept of persisting subscriptions, so when <A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at m1</A> comes back
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up, the Q will have no consumers at all. If you restart <A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">client at m2</A> then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yes, it'll recreate its subscription to Q, and thus receive all the msgs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sent to that Q. If you also restart <A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">client at m1</A> then that too will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recreate its subscription to Q and share the msgs with <A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">client at m2</A> as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Confirms what ive been thinking... But Is there any way for clients to be
</I>&gt;<i> notified of dead subscriptions ? That would be helpful, else i would have to
</I>&gt;<i> keep polling something to get that information..
</I>
Well, you could simply check to see if the socket is still open. If the
broker goes down then your network socket from the client will also go
down.
