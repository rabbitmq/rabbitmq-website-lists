The reason for durable in this case was to match the exchange, since a
decision had been made to declare the exchange manually as a once-off
and keep it around rather than having clients do that.  I'm content to
have the clients attempt to declare the exchange if it doesn't exist
though.

Hm, in this case the server wasn't restarted, but the clients were shut
down and replaced by new machines.  Perhaps it's also an issue if the
connection wasn't shut down cleanly?

&gt;<i> So I suggest dropping the 'durable' flag.

basic.consume was in use in this case.

&gt;<i> And exclusivity is attached to the *connection*, not the channel, so 
</I>&gt;<i> it's worth checking that the connection(s) which created the queues are

They definitely are; the client machines to which those queues belonged
were taken down.

Anyway, it sounds like what we want in this particular case is
durable=False, exclusive=True, and auto_delete=False.  Ideally, we don't
actually want the queue to go away when the channel/consumer dies, but
only if the connection does.  Does that sound right?

Thanks,
-Tim
