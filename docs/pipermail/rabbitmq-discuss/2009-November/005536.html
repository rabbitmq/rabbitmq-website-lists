It's just been pointed out to me that of course with this, you won't
know when the queue is empty. You could either periodically, or wait
until the rate drops (which would require measuring rate), call
queue.declare to redeclare the queue which will give you a count of the
msgs in the queue. Depends how quickly you need to know that the queue
has become empty. Something like &quot;if you've not received a msg in the
last 0.5 seconds, try a queue.declare to detect queue-end&quot; may work for
you, but it's more application logic.
