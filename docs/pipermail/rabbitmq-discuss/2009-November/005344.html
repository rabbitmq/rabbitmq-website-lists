Marking an exclusive queue as durable is quite a strange thing to do, 
since 'exclusive' means the queue should go away when the creating 
connection dies, such as during a broker restart, but 'durable' means it 
should survive broker restarts.

There is in fact a known problem with durable, exclusive queues - if the 
server restarts it is possible that these queues survive even though 
their owning connections are dead.

So I suggest dropping the 'durable' flag.

Also note that auto_delete only kicks in only after the queue has had at 
least one consumer registered with basic.consume. basic.get doesn't count.

And exclusivity is attached to the *connection*, not the channel, so 
it's worth checking that the connection(s) which created the queues are 
indeed dead.


Regards,

Matthias.
