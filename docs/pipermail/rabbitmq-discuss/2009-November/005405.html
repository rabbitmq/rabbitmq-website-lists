<PRE>We talk every now and then about deduplication filters, for avoiding
repeated work. One problem is that it can be hard to know what to do if
you have a worker pool, because you have to share the state about what
messages the whole pool has seen, across the whole pool.

Sounds like a job for a distributed key-value store. What if redis,
riak, even memcached, were used as the dedup filter? Each worker pool
(a.k.a &quot;queue&quot;, heh) would have a key-value store of their own. The
store would hold, for each labelled request, either

 - nothing: the request is fresh to the pool

 - an indication of partial completeness and/or receipt

 - the response that was sent back to the requestor, that can be
   sent back again if a replay is detected, without doing any more
   work

The nice thing is that not only are these distributed key-value stores
pretty quick these days, they also scale up tremendously well and
furthermore you can &quot;shard&quot; them because you can scope them to the
collection of workers that are sharing a queue.

The only missing piece is clearing out old, definitely stale records
from the filter after a while. For that you can use a separate
garbage-collection/expiry process, I guess; I haven't run any
experiments here, though. Maybe some of these new stores even include
time-to-live for their records, which solves the problem for us!

So: rabbitmq for the routing, buffering, relaying and delivery of
requests and responses; and a distributed key-value store for deduplication.
