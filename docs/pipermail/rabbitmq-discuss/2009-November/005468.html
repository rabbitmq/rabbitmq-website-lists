<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; process hasn't crashed since. I wonder if either the .NET client or
</I>&gt;<i> rabbit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't honoring the noack for this use case?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The .Net and Java clients definitely honour the noAck flag. Can you
</I>&gt;<i> produce a small test case that shows the issue you're seeing?
</I>
I seemed to have mistakenly thought my problem was solved, when in fact I
just introduced a bug so I was no longer publishing anything. My Rabbit is
still crashing due to running out of memory with my noack queue. Though, I
have recently been told I will probably need to use qos and acks in order to
get the behavior I want in the end -- see the 'how to consume one message at
a time' thread.

&gt;<i> Well on a 64-bit Linux system, I've made erlang happily eat 10s of GBs
</I>&gt;<i> of memory. I would have thought that erlang should be able to make use
</I>&gt;<i> of 2GB in Windows, but that error message suggests to me that's coming
</I>&gt;<i> back from malloc, thus it's Windows that's causing the issue. We would
</I>&gt;<i> thoroughly recommend you use at least a 64-bit system. ;)
</I>
It's a 64 bit OS, but the erlang that shipped with rabbit in the Windows
package was 32 bit and I was trying to go with the defaults. Is there a 64
bit erlang build for Windows? I couldn't find one...

Looks like I'll probably end up moving my cluster to Linux if there isn't a
64 bit Windows runtime.
