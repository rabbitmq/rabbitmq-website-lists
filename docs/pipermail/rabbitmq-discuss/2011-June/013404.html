<PRE>James

It's good to hear that your colleague had good experiences with RabbitMQ.

I'm confused by the statement &quot;couldn't be placed behind a
load-balancer&quot;.  That's not the case for RabbitMQ which *can* be used
with a load balancer.  Here's Josh from the Nokia team talking about
their set-up: <A HREF="http://www.joshdevins.net/2010/04/16/rabbitmq-ha-testing-with-haproxy/">http://www.joshdevins.net/2010/04/16/rabbitmq-ha-testing-with-haproxy/</A>

See also our HA page here: <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/pacemaker.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/pacemaker.html</A>
This an 'active/passive' set-up.

I think that perhaps your colleague meant that RabbitMQ lacks an
'active/active' style HA set-up.  In this set-up there can be two
'live' copies of the broker state, so that if one fails, the other is
available immediately.  It is correct that RabbitMQ cannot do this
today, but we have a solution in the works which has been discussed on
this list recently.  If you can't find it in the archives let us know.

BTW, if you look at Josh's blog post above you can also click through
the the Beetle project from Xing.  This provides an active/active dual
redundant type set-up by running two brokers and sending all messages
to both.  It's an application layer solution, specific to Ruby and
using the consumers to de-dup.  One reason many people shy away from
such a set up is that you need to have a thorough understanding of
what can go wrong.  By contrast the new Rabbit HA will provide the
capability within the broker itself, which should make it easier to
manage and generally more predictable...

In the new HA there *will* be a concept of a master.  This is
described in the draft documentation which Matthew posted to this list
recently.
