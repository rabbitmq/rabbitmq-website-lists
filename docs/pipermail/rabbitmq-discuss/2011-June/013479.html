Hi Adam,

No such tool exists as far as I am aware. Hermes covers some of this but what it is not is any kind of enterprise bus monitoring solution, it is a developent/test/support desktop application.

At a client I am currently building a solution that covers the bus monitoring side of things and for this we are using a mixture of  <A HREF="http://www.codestreet.com/template.php?page=replay,">http://www.codestreet.com/template.php?page=replay,</A> Tibco Business Works for the CEP engine and some custom tooling to build the dashboards using GWT with a simple server tier containing the history of &quot;reconstituted workflows&quot; with &quot;pointers&quot; into the message (replay) store for their content.

You could swap out BW for sure and use Esper but I've not seen any open source equivalent of the replay server (i.e. A Tivo for your message bus) - its incredibly useful.

The dashboards are quite custom to the workflow at this company as are the CEP rules to monitor the message flows. Using GWT has made the dash boards very functional and quick to develop - more so than a product that needs configuring and tweaking and never reaching the sophistication of one coded properly. Using a CEP engine externalizes the business logic nicely in a way discussable with the more technical business folk.

For the more straightforward requirements of browsing queues and subscriptions and their manipulation, we use Hermes.

Hope this helps.

Colin.

Adam,

I think HermesJMS might be a good starting point: <A HREF="http://www.hermesjms.com/">http://www.hermesjms.com/</A>

I have bcc'd the author.

</I>&gt;<i>  - Ability to acknowledge/comment on failed messages
</I>&gt;<i>  - Support for displaying/viewing Java objects, (probably limits me to Java

</I>&gt;<i>  - Have the ability to send email alerts based on user defined conditions
</I>&gt;<i>  - Graphing, statistics and reporting regarding how many messages we're sent

</I>&gt;<i>  - Does not need to have a JMS adaptor, as long as their is an API to get

</I>&gt;<i>  - BAM style dashboard
