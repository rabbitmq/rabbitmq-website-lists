Hi Brian. You're right, this isn't very well documented. I'll try to 
give an overview here.

There are two reasons why different attributes appear: relevance and 
permissions.

The first derives from the fact that internally the mgmt plugin works by 
receiving statistics events from the various entities (connections, 
channels, queues) inside the broker. If a certain entity has never done 
something it'll never emit an event related to that - for example if the 
queue has only just been created and never received or delivered any 
messages, it won't have a message_stats attribute. This could also 
happen if fine-grained stats are disabled - the broker simply isn't 
emitting the events in this case. Therefore for stats-related 
attributes, you should always bear in mind that any given metric might 
be unknown.

However, that's not what you are seeing. The presence or absence of 
listeners / nodes etc comes down to the principle that non-administrator 
users are not meant to be able to see any of the structure of the broker 
- so they can't learn about which nodes exist other than the one they 
connect to. They also don't see message rates for vhosts they can't 
access, even when looking at &quot;global&quot; rates, while administrators do.

tl;dr: it depends whether you connect as an administrator or not.

Of course, for monitoring, lots of people want to be able to have a 
monitoring user which does not have administrator rights but can still 
see everything. This will hopefully bubble towards the top of the to-do 
list soon.

Cheers, Simon
