<PRE>Hi Marcus,

You code does execute, but the peak performance achievable will be
limited, because you are establishing a new channel for each reply.

This works fine for me when I modify your example to use the same
connection for both receiver and sender.

&gt;<i> What happens is that the first message received everything works ok, the

Are you perhaps acknowledging the same message twice? Does the broker
logfile contain anything useful around the time this happens?

&gt;<i> base {RabbitMQ.Client.Exceptions.OperationInterruptedException} = {&quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> AMQP operation was interrupted: AMQP close-reason, initiated by
</I>&gt;<i> Application, code=200, text=\&quot;Connection close forced\&quot;, classId=0,
</I>&gt;<i> methodId=0, cause=&quot;}
</I>
&quot;initiated by Application&quot; normally means a shutdown initiated by the
application using the library, but I'm not sure I believe it in this
case. Your code traps and ignores exceptions in many places - are you
sure the real reason is masked in that way?
