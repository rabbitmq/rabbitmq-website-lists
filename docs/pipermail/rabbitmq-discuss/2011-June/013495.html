  &gt;How does the &quot;check object status before processing&quot; work? 
Couldn't a
  &gt;consumer get the message(s) before the rdbms transaction has
  &gt;committed, thus not see the up to date status and erroneously ignore
  &gt;the message?

Message age is a good way to catch that. If it's too recent 
(10s? 30s?), I just reject it to have it redelivered few seconds 
later. When a message becomes too old and the database hasn't 
been updated with a correct status yet, I discard the message. 
Staff is notified then, to check why a RDBMS commit failed or 
why did it take more than 30 seconds.

Actually, by looking at my application logs, no messages were 
ever rejected because of early arrival, so it's a very edge case 
and I can live with the possible overhead of having a message 
delivered twice while the RDBMS commits its transaction.

  &gt;&gt; &gt;Are you relying on tx atomicity at the moment? If so, can you
  &gt;&gt; &gt;elaborate on the specific use case? Also is the &quot;only 
atomic for a
  &gt;&gt; &gt;single queue&quot; restriction of AMQP's tx ok for your app?
  &gt;&gt;
  &gt;&gt;Hmm. Er... that limitation sounds new to me. Didn't pay 
attention :-)
  &gt;
  &gt;So in your app, can the messages inside a tx can end up in multiple
  &gt;queues?

Yes, and I think it could be a common case. For example, a 
transaction in my system may contain:
- a message to &quot;deliver.product.to.customer&quot;;
- a message to &quot;charge.prepaid.account&quot;;
- a message to &quot;notify.customer.by.sms&quot;.

How could I handle that without AMQP transactions?
