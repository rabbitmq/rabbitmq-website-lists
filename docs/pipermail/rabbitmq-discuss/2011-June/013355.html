<PRE>Once an IT organization grows beyond a certain size, I think it's natural for the ownership of production messaging infrastructure to be transferred over to a dedicated sysops team. 

That said, there is something to be said for not relinquishing too much control to dedicated teams. I prefer to maintain control of my development infrastructure: the overhead of coordinating with external teams on the numerous config changes involved during the development period of any project is a horrible productivity sink. 

YMMV.

Hey James,

We are actually dealing with this very problem right now, and maybe our
experience can help inform your decision.
We have been using RabbitMQ for a little over a year. It started off as a
cool side project, because we thought it would be an interesting tool to
have. Unfortunately, RabbitMQ worked so well that it soon became a mission
critical portion of our system, even though the underlying install/setup was
done by non-operations people. However, because Rabbit is so solid, we have
yet to have any negative consequences (knock on wood.)

We are now a mid-size business, and I am pushing hard to get ops to take
over the basic setup and administration of Rabbit. The way it is treated and
used is much like Memcache or any other service: I have people on my team
who deeply understand how to use it and architect applications around it,
but they work in conjunction with Ops who administers and manages it.

My take aways are therefore:
Rabbit became mission critical really quickly
+ There are people better suited at dealing with servers, hardware,
configurations, etc.
+ I don't like to wake up at 3am on Sunday
= Ops is taking ownership.
