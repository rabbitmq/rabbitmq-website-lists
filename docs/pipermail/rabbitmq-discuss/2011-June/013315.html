<PRE>Matthew Sackman escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> We would encourage all 3rd party clients to work to support the
</I>&gt;<i> extensions to AMQP 0-9-1 that we add. That does not mean that we
</I>&gt;<i> recommend you remove functionality that we remove - you can certainly
</I>&gt;<i> implement a superset of the functionality. But normally when we add and
</I>&gt;<i> remove features, it's because there is some fundamental deficiency that
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be addressed and so it's obviously helpful if 3rd party clients
</I>&gt;<i> are aware of that.
</I>Matthew,

I trust the RabbitMQ team judgement and agree that tx.* class has relatively few use cases
with Publisher Confirms. amqp gem also supports publisher confirms in 0.8.x series, our test suite covers them
and I am going to document that extension in detail with examples very soon.

That said, as a client library maintainer, I have a number of concerns:

* Should I explicitly discourage people from using tx.* class?
* How do I justify even more protocol fragmentation to library users?
* What do I do with my test suite that covers tx.* operations? I can add conditions that check for RabbitMQ versions
but that makes me think of Internet Explorer 6 and you can imagine what kind of thought that is.

I am not too worried about this. I see just one case my when applications could use tx.* and they currently don't.

However, I want amqp gem to have excellent documentation that also helps library users understand when to use what features
and why. The prospect of tx.* removal from that standpoint is a problem for me. We already have to explain people what AMQP 0.8 to
0.9.1 move means and why they cannot use stock Ubuntu packages. Adding one more note that &quot;oh, and if you happen to use transactions,
please use RabbitMQ server &lt; 2.6.0&quot; is possible but I can imagine it won't reassure readers in RabbitMQ stability and maturity.

So, what are the RabbitMQ team recommendations for library maintainers?
