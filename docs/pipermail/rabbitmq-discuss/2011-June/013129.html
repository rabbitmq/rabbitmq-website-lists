This would likely be a lot to document, but perhaps a start would be to document just the base attributes that should be in every single request for a given resource, and then build the docs up from there. So, what should be in an /api/queues response if: 

You're not an admin and:
a) there are no queues
b) there are queues, but no events
c) there are queues and events

You *are* an admin and:
a) there are no queues
b) there are queues, but no events
c) there are queues and events

That'd be a good start, and you can build from there to include attributes with object values that also differ and all the corner case-ish things. 

If there were some kind of collaborative doc project with a moderator or a passthrough for commits, I'd love to know about that, btw.
Let me know!

</I>&gt;<i> There are two reasons why different attributes appear: relevance and 
</I>&gt;<i> permissions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first derives from the fact that internally the mgmt plugin works by 
</I>&gt;<i> receiving statistics events from the various entities (connections, 
</I>&gt;<i> channels, queues) inside the broker. If a certain entity has never done 
</I>&gt;<i> something it'll never emit an event related to that - for example if the 
</I>&gt;<i> queue has only just been created and never received or delivered any 
</I>&gt;<i> messages, it won't have a message_stats attribute. This could also 
</I>&gt;<i> happen if fine-grained stats are disabled - the broker simply isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> emitting the events in this case. Therefore for stats-related 
</I>&gt;<i> attributes, you should always bear in mind that any given metric might 
</I>&gt;<i> be unknown.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, that's not what you are seeing. The presence or absence of 
</I>&gt;<i> listeners / nodes etc comes down to the principle that non-administrator 
</I>&gt;<i> users are not meant to be able to see any of the structure of the broker 
</I>&gt;<i> - so they can't learn about which nodes exist other than the one they 
</I>&gt;<i> connect to. They also don't see message rates for vhosts they can't 
</I>&gt;<i> access, even when looking at &quot;global&quot; rates, while administrators do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> tl;dr: it depends whether you connect as an administrator or not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, for monitoring, lots of people want to be able to have a 
</I>&gt;<i> monitoring user which does not have administrator rights but can still 
</I>&gt;<i> see everything. This will hopefully bubble towards the top of the to-do 
</I>&gt;<i> list soon.
