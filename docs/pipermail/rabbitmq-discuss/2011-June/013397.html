<PRE>Hi All,

Had a half day of architecture meetings where we discussed rabbitMQ as
an essential component to a new large scale project and one of the
attendees mentioned that they had used RabbitMQ at his previous job
awhile back. He said it worked great but one concern was that it had a
single point of failure and it couldn't be placed behind a load
balancer. He didn't know if that had changed but was just curious as
it was something that had concerned him.

However, he also added that they had been using it for a year by the
time he left and no problems had cropped up. :)

So has this changed any? Do clusters rely on a master node to be running?


Thanks,
James
