<PRE>&gt;<i> The problem I see is that, if a consumer issues a regex as a pattern for
</I>&gt;<i> a subscription, when a message gets published, how do I find out all the
</I>&gt;<i> regexes I know about that match? Do I loop over all the consumers,
</I>&gt;<i> asking each one if they match or not? Seems kind of inefficient.
</I>
Indeed.  Building an FSM with bindings as transitions states would be a 
start.  &quot;Collecting&quot; states after binding deletion is likely to be the 
tricky bit.

&gt;<i> Just wondering if this problem was known and passed over early on, and
</I>&gt;<i> the */# mechanism used to get around this problem.
</I>
I suspect the */# mechanism was made to match JMS implementations, and I 
suspect those used it because it was fairly easy to implement and to 
grasp as a user.

Regular expressions are not tougher in kind than globbing, since they 
both describe regular languages.  They are more fiddly to implement however.

&gt;<i> I also thought about using some text indexing engine (a la lucene) to
</I>&gt;<i> solve this problem, but if a message gets published with a specific
</I>&gt;<i> routing key, you'd have to re-run the search attached to the consumers
</I>&gt;<i> to get an updated list of messages that match a given regex. So there's
</I>&gt;<i> no benefit from doing that either, so far as I can tell.
</I>
One approach to implementing topic matching is to keep something a bit 
like a reverse index: <A HREF="http://www.openamq.org/doc:fast-topic-matching">http://www.openamq.org/doc:fast-topic-matching</A>
