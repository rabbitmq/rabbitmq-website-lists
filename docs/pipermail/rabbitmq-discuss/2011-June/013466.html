</I>Gordon,

Last time I looked I looked at MRG it was using separate journals for 
each queue and, in case of failure, couldn't guarantee atomic 
transactions with publishes or acks across multiple queues. This was 
common knowledge when I worked at Red Hat and something the MRG team, 
unsurprisingly, liked to keep quiet about. Customers tend not to be 
happy if they're told their transactions aren't really transactions.

Maybe you've fixed your implementation by now (although it's hard to see 
how you could do it without resorting to some slow, clunky, hand rolled 
2PC protocol), but please bear in mind that by pointing your finger at 
Rabbit, when you're own implementation was no different in that regard 
smacks of hypocrisy.
