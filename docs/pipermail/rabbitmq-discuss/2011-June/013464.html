Yes, but as you know the reason that the full atomicity guarantee was 
not clarified in 0-9-1 was that RabbitMQ did not support it.

I'm certainly not saying you should, either. It's entirely reasonable to 
consider whether any additional feature is in fact used and needed.

I just think its a little unfair to portray it as a question of 
inadequate guarantees in the specification since that guarantee was in 
fact limited by implementation.
