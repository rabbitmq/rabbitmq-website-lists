If so I'd like to know what is holding you back.

Hi Matthias!

We use the tx class. Just because we can't afford to lose any messages. For our case we only use it for a single connection/channel/queue (and for a single message...) This, of course, makes publishing fairly slow..

There is no real reason for us not switching to confirms. It's planned, but I simply haven't had time to do the necessary changes yet. I did however do a quick branch-and-hack-test to just to try it out, and it seems to cover our use case fine (..think streaming analog values..) :)
