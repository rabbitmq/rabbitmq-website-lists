  &gt;Interesting. What guarantees are you getting out of this? Presumably
  &gt;you cannot (easily) roll back the file system write. And 
since the
  &gt;RDBMS transaction and RabbitMQ transaction are separate, how 
do you
  &gt;undo the first one when the second one fails?

If a filesystem write fails, I rollback both the RDBMS and 
RabbitMQ transactions. Then I send a tx.commit to RabbitMQ; if 
this fails I rollback the RDBMS. Finally, I commit the RDBMS.

My message consumers are idempotent and always check object 
status in RDBMS before processing messages, so should I fail to 
commit to RDBMS after having committed to RabbitMQ, those 
messages will be ignored.
I don't care about filesystem, as I have periodic daemons 
removing old or unused files anyway.

  &gt;More broadly, what is the recovery strategy, i.e. what do you after
  &gt;you've done the rolling back? Retry again after a while?

If the external event is synchronous, I just return a temporary 
error and have the external client re-submit its request. If 
it's asynchronous (like a message consumed from an internal 
queue) I just close the AMQP channel without acking the message 
and restart consuming later.

  &gt;&gt;Plus, what Tim Fox said about atomicity.
  &gt;
  &gt;Are you relying on tx atomicity at the moment? If so, can you
  &gt;elaborate on the specific use case? Also is the &quot;only atomic 
for a
  &gt;single queue&quot; restriction of AMQP's tx ok for your app?

Hmm. Er... that limitation sounds new to me. Didn't pay 
attention :-)

I'm not totally relying on disk-level atomicity; however the 
ability to commit or rollback a bunch of messages with a single 
command sounds still more 'atomic' than submitting, say, 5 
messages one by one (I might lose network connection to RabbitMQ 
between those submits).
