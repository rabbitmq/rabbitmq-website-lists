<PRE>Hi All,

After doing some functionality comparisons between v1.5.x and v1.6.x
branches, I have some basic questions about the upcoming release
schedules.

Specifically, I'm looking for a stable/tested (in other words,
released) version of RabbitMQ that supports the following features:

1) Basic QoS (allowing consumers to set the prefetch window to any
number, preferably 1)
2) Basic prioritization (allowing producers to set a priority of 1
through 10 [according to the spec?]) which RabbitMQ attempts to honor
on a best effort basis
3) Clean compatibility with OpenAMQ's C library (aka WireAPI?) -- or
clean compatibility with *some* type of C-based library that is
compatible with a recent version of RabbitMQ (maybe:
<A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-c/">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-c/</A> ?)
4) [Ideally], headers exchange support -- although I can make due
without this feature in the near term

I realize the developers may be tackling other higher-priority items
such as a high performance persister implementation, which may
effectively block any v1.6.x release from happening anytime soon.  I
also know that most (if not all?) of the 4 features are already baked
into the main RabbitMQ branch; however, some of the features still
need to be QA'd.

Can someone let me know if any of these features will be backported to
a future v1.5.x release?  If so, when would be an approximate
timeframe?  If not, is there any status update as to when a v1.6.x
would be released?  If there is no v1.6.x release timeframe, can you
list out what are the major blockers are (aside from the persister
problem)?  I was also wondering if there were any external
dependencies, such as a new AMQP spec version getting &quot;ratified&quot;,
before a v1.6.x gets released?

Thanks,
-- Darien
