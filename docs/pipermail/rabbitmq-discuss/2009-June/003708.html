If you use lib_amqp then you are shielded from that particular aspect.

</I>&gt;<i> is wrong.
</I>
That page is nearly 18 months old. A few things have changed in the API
since that post.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, have you looked at lib_amqp.erl? It contains a number of convenient

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How would I have found out about this?  I'll go investigate it now
</I>&gt;<i> that you've mentioned it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this would have gone a lot smoother had there been one or two
</I>&gt;<i> examples in the README that had some comments and that got maintained
</I>&gt;<i> along with the code.  It's not very fun to not have documentation, but
</I>&gt;<i> its even worse when the documentation you can find is incorrect.
</I>
There are a whole bunch of tests that ship with the code which can serve
as a starting point for further exploration.

Having said that, the Erlang client is experimental, and clearly marked
as such. One reason for its experimental status is the sparseness of
documentation.

We welcome patches to improve the code, comments, examples, docs, etc.
Also, perhaps you could write a blog post that substitutes the
out-of-date one above.


Regards,

Matthias.
