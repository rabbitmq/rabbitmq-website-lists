Well JSON schema is probably a non-starter as it's not formally settled into a 1.0 spec yet AFAIK. I suppose we *could* serve up a list of fields and mark them as mandatory or optional as well as providing their data types.

&gt;<i> An interesting twist on the above is also that in some circumstances, not all data is returned for a given request. I'm specifically thinking about the case where the 'stats' database isn't available, so only a subset of the fields were returned when querying queue stats (I think I'm recalling the exact scenario correctly.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I can see why that'd be annoying.

&gt;<i> A tiny bit more background - I'm starting to write tooling that will work against both 2.8 and 3.0 versions, so I need to query which version of the server I'm talking to. I initially queried a 3.0.1 instance for /api/overview and found the &quot;rabbitmq_version&quot; element. Great! So I coded that up in my tooling, and was then surprised when I didn't find that element when querying a 2.8.7 instance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this normal? Correct? Who knows? I have no schema reference to consult. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Fair point, though I suspect we'll end up improving the documentation rather than coming up with a way of providing a reference schema. I could be wrong though. :)
