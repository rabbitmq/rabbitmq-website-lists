&gt;<i> In your code, you do a couple of things that alleviate the need for an insulator. First of all, instead of communicating using stdio, you send your port commands asynchronously using `Port ! Command` which is not blocking. Secondly, in your loop (that gets data back from the port) you use `after 5000 -&gt; [{error,timedout}|Acc]` to terminate the loop, so this won't block indefinitely either. As long as you're happy that authentication always has to work within 5 seconds then this approach is ok and you don't need to do anything else.

Cool.

&gt;<i> If you want to allow longer authentication times and still terminate gracefully when, for example, the broker is being shut down, then you've got to do more work.
</I>
I'll keep this in mind and deal with it if any problems/issues arise.

&gt;<i> One thing I would suggest is that if you do hit `after 5000` and time out whilst waiting for the external program to complete, it *might* be a good idea to close the port so as not to leak resources. Check the open_port documentation for details.
</I>
Ah, I didn't read the eof documentation good enough it seems.

&quot;The port will not be closed at the end of the file and produce an exit signal.&quot;

Thank you, good catch!

Another thing I spotted on the option exit_status was:
&quot;If the eof option has been given as well, the eof message and the
exit_status message appear in an unspecified order.&quot;

Suggestions? &quot;It works for me&quot; at the moment ; P

How can I keep a &quot;global&quot; (within the same authentication process)
state? I belive I have read that records can be used for this? (Or is
this another question for erlang-discuss? ; )

What would you recommend?


Thank you so much again both of you,
- Simon
