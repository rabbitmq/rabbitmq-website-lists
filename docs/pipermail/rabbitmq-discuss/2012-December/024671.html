<PRE>Hey all,

I've scoured the internet and this mailing list for Unicorn + Amqp examples 
and can't seem to find anything that works for my use case, which is 
presumably a very common one.  Basically, based on user web requests I want 
to publish messages to a queue, have them processed on another server, and 
then show the results to the user.  I would be extremely grateful is 
someone could provide any insight here.

So my current design (based mostly on the Amqp gem examples and this gist: 
<A HREF="https://gist.github.com/2692861">https://gist.github.com/2692861</A>) waits for a unicorn worker to fork, runs 
the EM in another thread, and then does a next_tick that creates the 
connection to the server.  Two issues:

1. From my controllers, what is the best way to publish messages?  That 
gist has the controllers calling &quot;EventLoopHelper.run&quot; and then publishing, 
but shouldn't the EM already be running in another thread?  It seems like I 
should be calling next_tick with a block that publishes a message, that way 
on the next reactor tick the message will get published.  But when I use 
next_tick, the messages get publishes sometimes and other times nothing 
happens.  That is, someones the message isn't published and other times a 
bunch of messages are published.  Is this a thread safety issue or am I 
just completely missing something?  I haven't event attempted to add 
subscribe functionality into the reactor yet, so nothing should be blocking 
the reactor.

2. I also want my unicorn rails app to subscribe to a queue that has the 
result of the long-running jobs that occur on another server.  If I call 
subscribe in the reactor event loop, will that block the reactor from 
publishing messages submitted by the controllers?

Any help would be much appreciated!

-Milo
