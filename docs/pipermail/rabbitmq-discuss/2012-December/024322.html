<PRE>Gavin,

No probs, these things happen. For the time being I&#8217;ve taken a look at your fix, it makes sense, so I&#8217;ll hack this into my copy of the library until 0.9.9 is official and I&#8217;ve had a chance to run my tests on it.

Regards,

Dan.

Hi Dan,

From my testing and working through the issue It does appear that RabbitMQ does not send a body frame if the body size is 0. This issue has been fixed (<A HREF="https://github.com/pika/pika/issues/227">https://github.com/pika/pika/issues/227</A>) and will be addressed in the next release. I have a few other fixes I am looking to group with this one prior to 0.9.9 being pushed to pypi.

If you want to test, master is fairly stable at this point and it can be installed via pip:

 pip install -e git+<A HREF="https://github.com/pika/pika.git#egg=pika">https://github.com/pika/pika.git#egg=pika</A>

Sorry for the trouble.

Gavin

Gavin,



I have been using pika 0.9.8 with messages with only properties, but a body size of zero.



I am finding that the callback registered with the consumer does not get called.



Having debugged through it, I am only getting the Method and Header frames, but no Body frame. Is this expected behaviour?



Dan.

Pika 0.9.8 is purely a bugfix release addressing issues raised in 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 and has been uploaded to pypi. It has been tested against all the python demos at RabbitMQ.com&lt;<A HREF="http://RabbitMQ.com">http://RabbitMQ.com</A>&gt; and appears to work as expected in those cases. Thanks to those who reported issues.



The documentation has been updated and can found at <A HREF="http://pika.readthedocs.org/">http://pika.readthedocs.org/</A>



Bugfixes

 *   Channel.queue_declare/BlockingChannel.queue_declare not setting up callbacks property for empty queue name (Issue #218)
 *   Channel.queue_bind/BlockingChannel.queue_bind not allowing empty routing key
 *   Connection._on_connection_closed calling wrong method in Channel (Issue #219)
 *   Fix tx_commit and tx_rollback bugs in BlockingChannel (Issue #217)

If you happen across any bugs, please report them at <A HREF="https://github.com/pika/pika/issues">https://github.com/pika/pika/issues</A>



Regards,



Gavin
