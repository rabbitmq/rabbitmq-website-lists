<PRE>Hi,

We have recently encountered an issue where RabbitMQ (2.8.2, Erlang R15B01) crashes when logging off the VMWare console (Guest OS Windows Server 2003 32bit), using ESXi 5.0.0. We can reproduce this, seems to happen every time.

Has anyone else encountered such as issue?

Many thanks,

Dan.
