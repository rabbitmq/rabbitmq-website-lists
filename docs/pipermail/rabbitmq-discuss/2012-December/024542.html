We talk about LAN vs WAN because of the different probability of 
partitions rather than because of performance.

Having said that:

Resource creation and deletion (exchanges / queues / bindings / users / 
vhosts / permissions) is synchronous across the cluster (in fact a 2PC). 
Messaging (publish / confirm / deliver / ack) is async (although there 
were some synchronous bits publishing in mirrored queues in 2.x). And 
it's the synchrony that hurts performance as latency goes up obviously.

&gt;<i> All that said, I may choose to use federation rather than clustering

</I>&gt;<i> and federate the clusters. It's more expensive though and more moving parts.
</I>
I would recommend that you federate across zones.

&gt;<i> We use DynamoDB and Riak as reliable KV stores, as well as s3. Riak
</I>&gt;<i> seems to have good tolerance of net splits. (*Why is it better than
</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmq in this respect?)
</I>
Based on a quick reading of their docs, Riak clusters are eventually 
consistent, like RabbitMQ federation.

Cheers, Simon
