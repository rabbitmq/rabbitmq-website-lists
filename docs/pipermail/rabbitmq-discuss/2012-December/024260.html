Looks like the server did not receive any frame for too long. Check the
server logs to confirm thwat.

Heartbeats in the sending and receiving direction are completely 
independent. When a heartbeat interval has been agreed then each peer is 
supposed to send *some* data to the other at least every 
heartbeat_interval. The heartbeat frames are there to fill in the time 
slots when no other data is being sent.

So you certainly shouldn't be *waiting* to receive a heartbeat before 
sending something since that would establish an artificial interlocking 
of the sending and receiving direction.

For more details see section 4.2.7 of the AMQP 0-9-1 spec.

If you think you are doing everything right and the connection is still 
being torn down then look at a protocol trace with wireshark. That 
should hopefully identify the problem.

Regards,

Matthias.
