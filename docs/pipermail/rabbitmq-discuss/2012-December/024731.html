Well, I'm not sure if I'm an appropriate person to own this. I don't know
Erlang, or much of any functional programming for that matter. (I've had
Lisp &amp; Clojure on my wishful thinking to-do list for a while now.) I've got
a medium-level of experience with build systems (autoconf, etc.) but this
rebar thing even looks like a whole new world...

I could put some organization time and effort, and I could definitely test
on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. I could even probably put together a SRPM
and write some documentation.

On the technical revitalization front, the only effort that would make sense
would be to move RabbitMQ-&#216;MQ to the erlzmq2 (NIF-based) bindings. It sounds
like their native implementation had a significant performance boost and...
well the whole point about &#216;MQ (in my opinion) is that it's all about when
you really need that 10x performance and have to eschew the more
&quot;enterprise-friendly&quot; protocols like AMQP. (When I read the blog by Martin
S&#250;strik about the work he and Michael Bridgen had done, it made a whole lot
of sense and really got me pretty excited.)

My hope is that, for the most part, the erlzmq-&gt;erlzmq2 API change would be
pretty straightforward with at most a few subtle changes in the API call,
but I've got nothing to base that on, other than the fact that there are
only 25 lines in the module's source code that call the &quot;zmq:&quot; API, and they
mostly look like &quot;{ok, Data} = zmq:recv(Sock)&quot;. I would have attempted it
myself, but given the fact that I have zero Erlang experience, I wouldn't
even know where to begin in terms of debugging.

But if anyone is willing to put in a little time on the technical side, I'm
willing to test the build environments, assemble an SRPM (heck, maybe even
figure out how to put together a Mac Port), write some documentation and
essentially inject a little community spirit into things.

Anyway, thanks, Tim for your response. (And Happy New Year)
