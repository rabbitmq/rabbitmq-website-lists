I think that the alternate-exchange mechanism 
(<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/ae.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/ae.html</A>) might help you here. Publish to a 
non-federated direct exchange X1. Declare X1 with an AE of a federated 
direct exchange: X2.

Your workers will need to bind to both X1 and X2 unfortunately, but 
messages should get routed the way you want - if there's a local binding 
then the message never hits the federated exchange, but if there isn't 
it then goes out over federation.

What this *won't* do is ensure the message only gets delivered to *one* 
other broker over federation. Aha! But you could do that by making each 
X1 be federated, but have its upstream set to a single remote X2, with 
the broker federation links arranged in a ring. Then messages go round 
the ring, at each node either being delivered locally or forwarded on by 
federation. You'd need to set max_hops to the ring size at each point, 
so that unroutable messages go round the ring once and then die.

Does this make sense?

Cheers, Simon
