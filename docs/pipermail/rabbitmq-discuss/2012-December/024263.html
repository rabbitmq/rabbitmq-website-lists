Lots of users have heartbeats enabled in their clients. This is 
well-tested code at the server, and hasn't changed for ages. So this is 
very unlikely to be a server problem.

&gt;<i> I wonder if you or anybody have been using heartbeat in

</I>
I'd be surprised if there are no users of the C client that have 
heartbeats enabled.

As I suggested before, your best bet is probably run a packet capture 
with wireshark (or similar) to help identify the problem.

&gt;<i> server log says:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;=ERROR REPORT==== 2-Dec-2012::10:04:05 ===
</I>&gt;<i> closing AMQP connection &lt;0.13204.0&gt;  (client ip:54786 -&gt; server ip:5672):
</I>&gt;<i> {timeout,running}
</I>
Right, that's the server saying it didn't receive any data or a 
heartbeat for too long. The message is more informative in more recent 
version of rabbit - though the logic hasn't changed - so you may want to 
upgrade.

Regards,

Matthias.
