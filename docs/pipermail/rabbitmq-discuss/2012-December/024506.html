<PRE>Hiya,

We are running as a process, not a service, which is being run by a service-based wrapper. We do this so we have better control over the environment variables we use to configure the broker.

Do you think running as a service may not be susceptible to this issue?

It should be noted that we do not get the problem when running Windows Server 2008, only 2003.

By the way, the process just dies suddenly, there is no exception in the logs.

Dan.

Hi, Dan:

How did Rabbit come to start running in these scenarios?  As a service or an app?  When you describe it crashing what leads you to believe it died in an ugly way?  Are there horrors in the logs indicating things went awry?

Best regards,
Jerry

Hi,

We have recently encountered an issue where RabbitMQ (2.8.2, Erlang R15B01) crashes when logging off the VMWare console (Guest OS Windows Server 2003 32bit), using ESXi 5.0.0. We can reproduce this, seems to happen every time.

Has anyone else encountered such as issue?

Many thanks,

Dan.
