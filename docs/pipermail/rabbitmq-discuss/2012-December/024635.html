If the other nodes are showing up in red, then they're definitely inaccessible. This could be down to network interruptions. I'm afraid I can't suggest what might be wrong just on the basis of red lights in the 'console' - I assume you're talking about the management web interface here?

&gt;<i> Hence we decided to handle node failure to ensure node resiliency.

There are a great number of factors to take into account when planning this sort of thing. The *most* important factor when using rabbit in a cluster, is to ensure you don't encounter any net-split, as rabbit doesn't handle these well. I have no idea why your nodes became unable to see one another, but if you post the logs (or a subset of them) somewhere then we can take a look. If you can identify why the nodes got disconnected, it would help figure out how to guard against this in future.
