<PRE>The subject line says it all. Having spent some time, and also that of the
folks on this list, running the above examples and finding several that do
not work, i.e., crash, I am now wondering if I am spending time on something
which is shipped as an example, i.e., there is no guarantee that it will
work on all supported platforms, e.g., Windows.

This is a general question for now; specifics can be provided if there is
interest in learning which of the examples do not work. MulticastMain comes
to mind, StressPersister is another.

However, I did not want to waste everyone's time if the examples are, well,
examples!

I have found the examples more than useful as a learning and testing tool,
so am grateful that they are there.

Cheers, John
