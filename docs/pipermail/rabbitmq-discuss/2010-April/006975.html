<PRE>Hi
Thanks for your second answer :)
I ve tried RabbitMQ and Qpid client but it's planned to use rabbitMQ client.

Objet : Re: [rabbitmq-discuss] Behavior of consumers listening to the same queue

Hi Pierre,

I've just realised I answered totally the wrong question, so I'll have
another go!

</I>
Yes, the messages should be treated independently, and should be able to
be processed in parallel (ignore everything I said in my last email
about multiple queues!).

However, most clients are implemented with one &quot;main&quot; thread which pulls
the messages off the socket. If you are getting that thread to do the
processing, then yes, it'll block, and you'll achieve no parallelism.
You really need for that thread to hand off the message to some other
thread so that the main thread can go back and grab the next message off
the socket.

If you're using our Java client then you need to be using the
QueueingConsumer which exists for exactly this purpose, rather than just
filling in the handleDelivery callback yourself. You didn't mention
which client you're using though.

I hope that helps,

Matthew
