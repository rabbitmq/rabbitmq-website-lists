Hi Matthew,

Thanks a lot for the clarification! I was thoroughly confused and this
all makes a lot more sense now. I think I'll try the transactional
method (or perhaps even work on replacing our current system with
rabbitmq-shovel).

Much appreciated,

Noah

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. A message is read from the local queue and published to the remote
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchange (via amqp_channel:cast/3), which appears to be successful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Be aware of cast. Cast returns as soon as the message has been added to
</I>&gt;<i> the writer's mailbox (and actually can be sooner...). Needless to say,
</I>&gt;<i> this does not suggest the message has made it out of the socket, or even
</I>&gt;<i> been looked at by the socket writer. In general, I tend to use
</I>&gt;<i> amqp_channel:call, not cast, for almost everything as it avoids millions
</I>&gt;<i> of messages backing up in the mailbox of the writer process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Relevant comments from rabbit_writer.erl are included here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> %% So instead we lift the code from prim_inet:send/2, which is what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> %% gen_tcp:send/2 calls, do the first half here and then just process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> %% the result code in handle_message/2 as and when it arrives.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> %%
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> %% This means we may end up happily sending data down a closed/broken
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> %% socket, but that's ok since a) data in the buffers will be lost in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> %% any case (so qualitatively we are no worse off than if we used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> %% gen_tcp:send/2), and b) we do detect the changed socket status
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> %% eventually, i.e. when we get round to handling the result code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, so using call, not cast, pretty much gets you to this point, but
</I>&gt;<i> obviously no further.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. After the message is &quot;written&quot; to the exchange, the connection is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seen as closed, messages are sent out to listening Erlang processes, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a new connection is subsequently re-established by my code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, at this point the message that caused the connection drop to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> noticed is permanently lost; since the connection wasn't actually active
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when it was published it can't possibly be rejected, and since no errors
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were thrown at publish-time, it appears as if the message was sent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> successfully. In our code, this results in ~50% data loss when a node
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unexpectedly goes down.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right. What you're doing is fine, but with your approach you clearly
</I>&gt;<i> need to hold on to the most recent message you received in case the
</I>&gt;<i> connection drops and you then need to resend it. Furthermore, as you're
</I>&gt;<i> using cast, you could have millions of messages queued up with the
</I>&gt;<i> writer process mailbox which all would be lost.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, you're not acking. So, on connection drop to the remote, you
</I>&gt;<i> could also connection drop to the local. Then, the local broker will
</I>&gt;<i> requeue everything that's not been acked, and when you reconnect, you'll
</I>&gt;<i> find it all there. Now at that point, any ordering guarantees you had go
</I>&gt;<i> out the window, but that may not be a concern. Assuming you're using
</I>&gt;<i> basic.consume, you could set qos to prefetch of 1, which would then mean
</I>&gt;<i> that at most one message is buffered in the client without it being
</I>&gt;<i> acked, significantly limiting your exposure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, if you want to be really sure, use transactions to the
</I>&gt;<i> destination - that way you know you have to hang on to everything you've
</I>&gt;<i> published up until you get the commit_ok back, and then you are
</I>&gt;<i> guaranteed that it's been received.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And in an obvious plug, our shovel is capable of dealing with these
</I>&gt;<i> issues. ;)
