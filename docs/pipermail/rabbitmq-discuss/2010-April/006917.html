<PRE>Hi John,

What circumstances do they crash under?

They should work on all supported platforms. Of course, machines and operating
systems differ, so the &quot;examples&quot; intended for finding the limits of stability
of RabbitMQ will need different parameters in each new context.

&gt;<i> This is a general question for now; specifics can be provided if there

</I>
These are both for finding the limits of the system. They should run
identically on all platforms, but some platforms will perform worse than others
and so will require more conservative parameter settings.

Tony
