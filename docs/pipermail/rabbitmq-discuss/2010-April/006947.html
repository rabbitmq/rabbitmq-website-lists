<PRE>&gt;<i> While many peoeple have found rabbitmq-c to be useful, we know it has some deficiencies,
</I>&gt;<i> such as the difficulties of compiling it under Windows.
</I>
That's been the biggest obstacle to me getting involved. I've ported stuff *from* MS environments to others before (PC-&gt;Vax for a real time bond evaluation system, for example) but I have so little familiarity with the specifics of the gcc compilers and the various switches, pragmas and other compiler specific constructs, and the whole linux/unix tool set that I don't know where to start - I've been working on PCs with C and its derivatives for so long now that there's a real element of tunnel vision.
