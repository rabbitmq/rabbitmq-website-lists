Hmm. That's interesting. What happens if you just run &quot;erl&quot;, or maybe
just run &quot;erl&quot; as the rabbitmq user (sudo -u rabbitmq erl) ?

&gt;<i> It looks like I am doing something really fundamentally wrong.  I needed the new version of erlang packages because rabbitmq-shovel plugin needs rabbitmq-inets package which only exists in squeeze and above branch.  Appreciate any suggestion and help.

Not sure what you mean by rabbitmq-inets. There is currently a bug in
Rabbit which means that the current default head can't work on 12b3, but
it really should, and I think 12b3 is the version in lenny ...

What's the version of erlang in the backports?

Presumeably you're building from source? In which case &quot;make cleandb
run&quot; in the rabbitmq-server dir should start up rabbit as the current
user: if you're wishing to use the shovel you may find it doesn't work
with the 1.7.2 release, so it might actually just be a permissions issue
with the rabbitmq user trying and failing to read the beam files that
you've compiled yourself, or it might be trying to write log files and
getting permission errors - hence if you just try &quot;make run&quot; from the
rabbitmq-server, it sets up everything to write under /tmp.
