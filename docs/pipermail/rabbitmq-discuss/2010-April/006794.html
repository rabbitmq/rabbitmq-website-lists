Sure, that makes sense. The answer is yes, we do support Windows.
However, the unavailability of a 64-bit Erlang for Windows, and Windows'
unhelpful and inconsistent limits on address space for 32-bit programs
means that we do not recommend Windows. That said, pretty much every
bug that was fixed between 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 was in order to make RabbitMQ
work better on Windows - hence we are committed to supporting it, despite
its warts.

Yup, that is pretty much our position. At the end of the day, the
inability to reliably get &gt; 2GB memory assigned to Rabbit under Windows
is a pretty crippling issue. This should ease, once a 64-bit Erlang
appears for Windows, though I've no idea of any ETA for that.
