<PRE>&gt;<i> Jens,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have to admit at this point that I'm not an expert -- or even a gifted 
</I>&gt;<i> amateur -- at running RabbitMQ on Windows.  I'll try to help out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So there is an error when starting the exchange recovery module. Maybe a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> little bug?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but likely my packaging or some other circumstance rather than 
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ.  Exchange recovery really ought not to be a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you start from a fresh database?  i.e., was 
</I>&gt;<i> c:/Users/Compufreak/AppData/Roaming/RabbitMQ/db/rabbit-mnesia missing or 
</I>&gt;<i> empty before you started RabbitMQ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
@ Michael: No, I didn't delete that map (Didn't know I had to!). I just 
retried it and after deleting that map it works! Thank you for that..
@ Gustavo: I'm just someone who uses RabbitMQ, I don't know when the new 
version will be released.
@ Tony: About STOMP: how can our client send a content-length header to the 
server? We can use the content-length header at our client, but not at the 
server I think... Can you give some more info about this please?

I'm currently compiling the client project against the Silverlight runtime, 
and it seems to work. At this moment, I just rewrote the things we really 
need (this needs to be fixed as fast as possible), but I'm going to fix the 
other problems too.
I just managed to compile the whole project and I'm testing the dll right 
now, but there's another problem. Some of the projects I use are precompiled 
(I use DLL files for them), and they use a RabbitMQ.client DLL with these 
specifications:

// Assembly RabbitMQ.Client, Version 1.7.2.0
Location: 
E:\Jens\School\BAP\Tracker\LocONCommunication\LocONCommunication.Web\App_Data\DLL\RabbitMQ.Client.dll
Name: RabbitMQ.Client, Version=1.7.2.0, Culture=neutral, 
PublicKeyToken=89e7d7c5feba84ce
Type: Library

When I compiled my version of that client, I find these specifications:

// Assembly RabbitMQ.Client, Version 0.0.0.0
Location: E:\Jens\School\BAP\Tracker\Silverlight dlls\Not 
Silverlight\RabbitMQ.Client.dll
Name: RabbitMQ.Client, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null
Type: Library

So when my program links to the RabbitMQ.Client.dll file, I get an error 
that it can't find the right one...
What should I do to compile it with the right PublicKeyToken and the right 
version Number?

Kind Regards
