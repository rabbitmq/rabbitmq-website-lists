*nod*  Between that, and a couple of private replies indicating that it is
reliable enough for people to deploy, I am pretty comfortable.  Especially
because the architecture of RabbitMQ means that, as you say, a failure doesn't
hurt anything but the STOMP support.


I see that there is a bit of Debian packaging ephemera in the stomp Mercurial
repository, and that the rabbitmq-public-umbrella module also includes some
support for it.

I couldn't see, though, any advice on the site or the list archives about how
best to go ahead and build a Debian package for the extension.

Is that documented somewhere, or am I going to have to troll through the build
system and work that out myself?


All I really care about is building the STOMP adapter against release 1.7.2,
and perhaps about trialing the JSON-RPC module at some point in the future.
