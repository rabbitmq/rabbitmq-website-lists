<PRE>Hi

It seems there is an affinity between messaging use cases and some of
those addressed by &quot;NoSQL&quot; data stores.  I feel our communities
overlap, so I am comfortable promoting this event on the list.  Below
is an email from James Governor, one of the organisers.  I understand
this is a pay-for event.

One of the hottest topics in software development right now is what is
being called NoSQL. What is that? Here is a definition from
no-sqldatabase.org

&#160; &#160;NoSQL databases mostly address some of the points: being
non-relational, distributed, open-source and horizontal scalable. The
original intention has been modern web-scale databases. The movement began
early 2009 and is growing rapidly. Often more characteristics apply as:
schema-free, replication support, easy API, eventually consistency / BASE
(not ACID), and more. So the misleading term &quot;nosql&quot; (the community now
translates it mostly with &quot;not only sql&quot;) should be seen as an alias to
something like the definition above.

There's just under a week to go until NoSQL Europe, our conference about
NoSQL technologies, and how you use them. We've got a fantastic line up,
including keynotes from Amazon's Werner Vogels, The Guardian's Matt Wall;
speakers from Twitter, The BBC, Rackspace, Basho, 10gen, Neo Technology
and many others over 2 days. We have some fantastic workshops lined up on
Riak, MongoDB, Redis, and Neo4J, from members of their development teams
or core contributors.

Are you a European web or enterprise developer interested in using
different approaches to scale data-driven apps, who wants to know Where
have All The Good Databases Gone? &#160;Then this is the show for you. Tickets
are available from
