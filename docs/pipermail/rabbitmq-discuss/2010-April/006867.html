At the end of the day though, when messages pile up in a queue (just
takes one), you'll run out of memory at some point.

Without support for ttl/expires, Rabbit is particularly susceptible to
this &quot;problem&quot;. I realize this it's by design and there are cases
where you *want* this, but there are absolutely cases when you
*don't*. It just takes one flaky consumer to put your entire system in
jeopardy.

For this reason, I've moved all of our queues to exclusive + auto
delete. I'd prefer to maintain queue state as producers and consumers
drop off, but the benefit of this is not enough to justify the
risk/cost.

I also have an external monitor on queue size (I believe measured in
memory as per rabbitmqctl output) in the event a rogue consumer
declares a queue with the wrong settings.

FWIW, the qpid server does respect the ttl message property and this
condition is easier to manage as a result. I'm a fan of ttl as it's
application specific (producers get to chose how long their messages
should live) and provides a reasonable heuristic for deleting messages
that aren't consumed in a timely manner.

This has been brought up a few times and I understand that there is a
similar set of questions that need to be addressed. Nonetheless, from
my point of view, this is a topic (general problem) that should get a
bump in road map priority.
