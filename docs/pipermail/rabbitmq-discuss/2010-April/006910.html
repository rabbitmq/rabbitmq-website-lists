<PRE>Hi

Iam having trouble using the java rpcclient for multiple replies.
Basically my process makes an rpccall and gets reply from one or more
other process. This works if the rpcclient receives one reply for its
request, but as soon as it gets multiple replies it fails. I get the
following exception which doesn't say much about the root cause.

The case here is the process should check for dependent process, so it
sends a rpc call to all existing process and then decide if the required
service is up and running.
This is possible in .NET library of rabbitmq and working fine.

Any help is appreciated.

Error:
Consumer com.rabbitmq.client.RpcClient$<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">1 at b27c38</A> method handleDelivery
for channel
AMQChannel(<A HREF="amqp://guest@GBWMAPPROPC02.emea.win.ml.com:5672/,1">amqp://guest@GBWMAPPROPC02.emea.win.ml.com:5672/,1</A>) threw an
