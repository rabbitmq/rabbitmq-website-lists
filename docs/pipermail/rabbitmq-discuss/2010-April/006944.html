<PRE>Hi, all.  It's been very exciting to see the work done on RabbitMQ by
Rabbit Technologies, LShift, and individual contributors on things like
message persistence, plugins, and control and monitoring.  I catch up
reading the mailing list archives about once per month, alas, so it's
difficult to keep up with all the innovation.

With all the good work happening ... there's got to be a paper or three
lurking, waiting to escape from your neurons and fingers, right?  :-)

Please consider a paper for the ACM Erlang Workshop this fall in
Baltimore, Maryland, USA.  This year, we have two tracks for authors to
write for; the call for papers is included below.  If you have any
questions about the workshop, suitable topics, or the submission &amp;
review process, please contact me directly.

                      CALL FOR PAPERS
                Ninth ACM SIGPLAN Erlang Workshop
      Baltimore, Maryland, USA, Thursday, September 30, 2010

<A HREF="http://www.erlang.org/workshop/2010/">http://www.erlang.org/workshop/2010/</A>

A satellite event of the 15th ACM SIGPLAN International
Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP)

Erlang is a concurrent, distributed functional programming language
aimed at systems with requirements on massive concurrency, soft real
time response, fault tolerance, and high availability. It has been
available as open source for over 10 years, creating a community that
actively contributes to its already existing rich set of libraries and
applications. Originally created for telecom applications, its usage
has spread to other domains including e-commerce, banking, databases,
and computer telephony and messaging.

Erlang programs are today among the largest applications written
in any functional programming language. These applications offer
new opportunities to evaluate functional programming and functional
programming methods on a very large scale and suggest new problems for
the research community to solve.

This workshop will bring together the open source, academic, and
industrial programming communities of Erlang. It will enable participants
to familiarize themselves with recent developments on new techniques and
tools tailored to Erlang, novel applications, draw lessons from users'
experiences and identify research problems and common areas relevant to
the practice of Erlang and functional programming.

We invite two sorts of submissions:

   1) technical papers describing language extensions, critical
   discussions of the status quo, formal semantics of language constructs,
   program analysis and transformation, virtual machine extensions and
   compilation techniques, implementations and interfaces of Erlang
   in/with other languages, and new tools (profilers, tracers, debuggers,
   testing frameworks, etc.)

   2) practice and application papers describing uses of Erlang in the
   &quot;real-world&quot;, Erlang libraries for specific tasks, experiences from
   using Erlang in specific application domains, reusable programming
   idioms and elegant new ways of using Erlang to approach or solve a
   particular problem.

Instructions to authors

Papers must be submitted online via EasyChair (via the &quot;Erlang2010&quot; event).

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines. The length for technical papers
is restricted to 12 pages. For &quot;Practice and Application&quot; papers,
the length is restricted to 6 pages; papers in this cateogory may be
allocated less time for their talk and instead be given the opportunity
for a demo and/or poster session during the workshop. Each submission
must adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy. Violation risks summary
rejection of the offending submission. Accepted papers will be published
by the ACM and will appear in the ACM Digital Library.

Venue &amp; Registration Details

* For registration, please see the ICFP web site.
