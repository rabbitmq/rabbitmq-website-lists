<PRE>Hi everyone,

I didn't test the STOMP plugin or the new AMQP version yet, so I can't give 
new information about it. However, thank you guys for all the feedback. I'm 
going to test it after finishing the Silverlight client.
I used all my time working on that and it finally seems to work. I ran the 
tests that where delivered with the client and they're all working (except 
the tests that didn't even work in the original project). After that, I ran 
some example projects, and they're also working. Like I said before, I 
commented out the things we don't need (XML things, SSL, ...), so they 
aren't working yet. These functions will be fixed afterwards.
About the version: It was simple to change the version by adding the version 
number in the AssemblyInfo.cs file.
About the PublicKeyToken: Well, that's what I thought before... However, 
thanks for that.
When I finish the project, I'll send it to you and in the meantime, I'll 
keep you posted.
Next week I'm on collegetrip, so there won't be any updates...

Kind Regards

</I>&gt;<i> subject:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;It is recommended that SEND frames include a content-length header which
</I>&gt;<i>   is a byte count for the length of the message body. If a content-length
</I>&gt;<i>   header is included, this number of bytes should be read, regardless of
</I>&gt;<i>   whether or not there are null characters in the body. The frame still 
</I>&gt;<i> needs
</I>&gt;<i>   to be terminated with a null byte and if a content-length is not 
</I>&gt;<i> specified,
</I>&gt;<i>   the first null byte encountered signals the end of the frame.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (MESSAGE frames have a very similar paragraph in their description.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The RabbitMQ STOMP server plugin pays attention to this content-length 
</I>&gt;<i> header.
</I>&gt;<i> It also *always* supplies a content-length header on MESSAGE whenever the
</I>&gt;<i> message body is non-empty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm currently compiling the client project against the Silverlight
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> runtime, and it seems to work. At this moment, I just rewrote the things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we really need (this needs to be fixed as fast as possible), but I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going to fix the other problems too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hey this is excellent news! Will you be able to send us a patch?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What should I do to compile it with the right PublicKeyToken and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right version Number?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you might need our key for that. (Which clearly isn't an option 
</I>&gt;<i> :-) ) I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect you will have to recompile the DLLs you have that depend on the
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ client to have less strict dependencies. I'm afraid I'm not an 
</I>&gt;<i> expert
</I>&gt;<i> on the vagaries of .NET linking, though :-/
