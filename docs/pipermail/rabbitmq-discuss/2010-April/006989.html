Hi all,

I'm encountering an issue with publishing messages that are
mandatory/persisted (i.e., we can't risk dropping the messages). I have
a tool similar to rabbitmq-shovel (developed slightly before it). It
works like this:

1. A message is read from a queue on a local RabbitMQ instance.
2. The message is then published to a remote exchange, and if no errors
occur, acked. I attempt re-publish the message if I get a rejected call
from the remote RabbitMQ instance. This works almost all the time,
however...

I'm also listening for connection drops on the local and remote
connections, and re-establishing them if they go down. So something like
this occurs:

1. The connection to the remote RabbitMQ exchange is dropped (often this
is because I accidentally let way too many messages build up and the
node crashes, but that's a topic for another day and I'm guessing the
new persister is going to fix this issue quite nicely); however, no-one
is notified of the dropped connection because as far as I can tell the
checks for this are only run when data actually goes across the connection.

2. A message is read from the local queue and published to the remote
exchange (via amqp_channel:cast/3), which appears to be successful.
Relevant comments from rabbit_writer.erl are included here:
%% So instead we lift the code from prim_inet:send/2, which is what
%% gen_tcp:send/2 calls, do the first half here and then just process
%% the result code in handle_message/2 as and when it arrives.
%%
%% This means we may end up happily sending data down a closed/broken
%% socket, but that's ok since a) data in the buffers will be lost in
%% any case (so qualitatively we are no worse off than if we used
%% gen_tcp:send/2), and b) we do detect the changed socket status
%% eventually, i.e. when we get round to handling the result code.

3. After the message is &quot;written&quot; to the exchange, the connection is
seen as closed, messages are sent out to listening Erlang processes, and
a new connection is subsequently re-established by my code.

However, at this point the message that caused the connection drop to be
noticed is permanently lost; since the connection wasn't actually active
when it was published it can't possibly be rejected, and since no errors
were thrown at publish-time, it appears as if the message was sent
successfully. In our code, this results in ~50% data loss when a node
unexpectedly goes down.

I'm open to suggestions on a better way to architect my code to get
around this issue, but it seems (to me, and I must confess my general
ignorance to the implementation) like a bug or at least something that
should be addressed/cautioned about.

Regards and thanks in advance for any advice!

Noah
