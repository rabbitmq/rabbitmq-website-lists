I've noticed I'm a little schizophrenic when it comes to ACKing messages. I'm wondering how others handle whether or not (and at what point) I should acknowledge receipt of my messages.

In some cases, I apparently thought it was better to delay ACKing the message until the process has completely processed the message and either generated a result or produced an error. In other cases, I ACK the message as soon as I get it, which means I could lose it if there was a failure between the acknowledgement and the actual processing of the message. If I don't ACK it and hit an error, the message might be redelivered later. I'm not sure that's always desirable, given I often don't know what's in my messages (they're generic, but of specific &quot;types&quot;).

Ugh. Any helpful hints on when it's appropriate to ACK an incoming message?

Thanks for the great help! (and all that for free ;)
