<PRE>Hi,

I am new to RabbitMQ as well. I've been reading about it for a while
but started my first RabbitMQ server just yesterday. So far I'm very
impressed.

Ahh, this is something I've been trying to understand as well...

Is it the case that a RabbitMQ cluster a) allows a queue to be
accessed from every node in the cluster, but b) the queue and the
messages it contains only reside in/on a single node?

&gt;<i> There is an HA guide on its way
</I>
I'm definitely interested in reading this.

Best
Mark
