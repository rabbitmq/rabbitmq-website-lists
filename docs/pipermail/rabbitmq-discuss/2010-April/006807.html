You need to build from source. It's on branch bug21673.
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/build-server.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/build-server.html</A>

After the cd rabbitmq-server step, do an hg up -C bug21673

Note you'll need at least cygwin in order to build under Windows (and
obviously Erlang installed too, and no doubt all manner of fun and games
to get erl and erlc on your %PATH% and $PATH.

Note even under the new persister there is still a small per-message RAM
cost, *unless* you also use the rabbitmq-toke plugin
<A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-toke/">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-toke/</A> which will require you to have
Tokyo Cabinet installed. I have absolutely no experience of attempting
that under Windows.
