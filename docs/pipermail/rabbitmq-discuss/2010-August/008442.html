</I>threshold it, say, is only accepting messages at a rate of 0.01Hz. And
then, finally, it stops accepting messages altogether. Is that last,
minuscule change fundamentally different? I don't think so.
&lt;&lt;&lt;

Yes, absolutely, it is a different state. It may appear to the client as indistinguishable but it is, nonetheless, a distinct and identifiably different state. If a broker was down to accepting single message per minute, is that a problem if the client only contributes one message per week? Whereas if the broker has signalled &quot;I absolutely cannot accept any messages at all&quot; then this is an identifiably different situation and may require handling in a different way.

You may decide that so long as the broker is accepting messages at all, however slowly, that you will live with it. That's a decision for the client logic. Equally, you may decide that if and only if a broker has stopped messages completely via flow control then you want to send them elsewhere.

If a system is slowed to a crawl you can't know that it suddenly isn't going to clear. If a system has issued a stop, you know for certain that until told otherwise, nothing is moving. Fundamentally different situations.

I remember being told years ago, never confuse an observed effect (i.e. the system /appears/ to have stopped) with what is defined to be the case (i.e. we have been told to stop sending).
