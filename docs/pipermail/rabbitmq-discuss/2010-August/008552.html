<PRE>I originally debated on whether to write a standalone app or a plugin for the functionality I'd like to add to a couple applications I'm writing but I think I've decided it would work better as a plugin. It will need the exact same lifecycle as the broker, etc... so I'm trying to figure out what I need to set up to start developing a plugin. I've read the website info on getting started and I'm looking at the other plugins to see what the best practices are.

I'm trying to add &quot;webhook&quot; functionality to several applications I'm writing (basically my own version of PayPal notifications, Google Checkout callbacks, or GAE tasks), so I thought I'd create a plugin (&quot;rabbitmq-webhook&quot;?) that consumes messages on an exchange and uses the lhttpc module to send them to a configurable REST URL. 

For the first iteration, I'm going to keep it simple and have the webhook plugin manage its own queues, which means I'll have to address the problem of message delivery to the plugin as well as to AMQP consumers. I'm putting that off for the first draft.

The REST API to call, what method to use, what headers to send, etc... will all be configurable, but I'm going to respect message headers so that any of those parameters are overridable on a per-message basis.

Anyone written RabbitMQ plugins using erlide? I've been using TextMate, which I love, but I thought I'd at least see if there was a more productive way to write plugins than by using a text editor. :)

Alos, is there a &quot;hello world&quot; skeleton project that one can clone to get a jump start on writing a new plugin?

Thanks!
