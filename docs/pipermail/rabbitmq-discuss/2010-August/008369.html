Hi Mark,

I don't see any way of doing this using configuration options alone.
Unless I'm overlooking a more obvious route, you will need to recompile
the Erlang ssl module or the Rabbit networking module. I would suggest
the latter.

Adding the following tuple to SslOpts in rabbit_networking:boot_ssl/0
works for me using erlang R13B03 and R14A:
{verify_fun, fun(ErrorList) -&gt; length(ErrorList) == 0 end}
With this in place the server will reject a client presenting a
certificate not signed by a recognised CA.

I agree that this should be easier. Please let me know if you have
suggestions.


Regards

Emile
