<PRE>Hi Robert,

Robert Nicholson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">robert.nicholson at gmail.com</A>&gt; writes:
&gt;<i> What is the preferred way to build/run rabbitmq server?
</I>
On OS X, installation via macports is what we support and test.  I can't
claim that the macports approach is always as robust as we would like,
but it does seem to work for a lot of people.

Others have reported success installing the generic unix package on OS X
(see &lt;<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html#generic-unix">http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html#generic-unix</A>&gt;).  But to run
that, you need to install erlang, and one way to do that is through
macports (though you could use homebrew, or build it - and all its
dependencies - by hand).  So the macports approach seems the most
straightforward to me.

&gt;<i> Since I have VM Ware Fusion that's always an option if there's an
</I>&gt;<i> appliance.
</I>
That's an interesting idea, but we don't currently release such a thing.
But if you happen to have a Linux VM around (debian, ubuntu, or fedora),
installing rabbitmq-server there is really easy due to the package
management systems.

&gt;<i> When I try MacPorts all I end up with is what looks like an endless
</I>&gt;<i> loop of it trying to figure out what the dependencies are.
</I>
See below.

&gt;<i> I will include information for you here now ...
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>
I've checked the xmlto macports portfile (at
&lt;<A HREF="http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/textproc/xmlto/Portfile">http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/textproc/xmlto/Portfile</A>&gt;),
and I see that it does list getopt as a dependency, as well as 11 other
dependencies.  So installing it by hand could be quite a tiresome
exercise.

&gt;<i> When I tried MacPorts
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DEBUG: Didn't find receipt, going to depspec regex for: libiconv
</I>&gt;<i> DEBUG: Searching for dependency: expat
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>
This seems like a macports issue unconnected with the rabbitmq-server
port.  I see that it was reported to macports at
&lt;<A HREF="https://trac.macports.org/ticket/25923">https://trac.macports.org/ticket/25923</A>&gt;, and the underlying cuase is
described in &lt;<A HREF="https://trac.macports.org/ticket/25912">https://trac.macports.org/ticket/25912</A>&gt;.  But apparently
it was fixed 3 weeks ago.  So try the following three commands to bring
everything up to date:

  $ sudo port selfupdate
  $ sudo port sync
  $ sudo port upgrade outdated
