<PRE>Thanks, Matthew. 

It's good to hear that we won't need to upgrade the clients to the new client API. 

The reason I said it will try to re-cluster is because we use the cluster config file to automatically cluster when nodes start up fresh. 

I figured as much for the nodes themselves.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, build a new cluster, then switch your producers over to the new
