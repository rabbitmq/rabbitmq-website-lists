<PRE>&gt;<i>From my possibly naive understanding of the spec, it means quite simply that
</I>a message will be delivered guaranteed once and only once; but I somehow do
not think that that is quite what you were asking?

The nice part about JMS is that it is only an API spec and says nothing
about implementation.
I would have to look into the spec to see what the answer is to the
question: &quot;...how do they deal with duplicates...&quot; etc. If I find the time,
I shall be happy to look at the odd JMS implementation and see what the
various vendors do in cases such as that in question.
What I do know is that one can specify notification for when a message with
&quot;guaranteed delivery&quot; simply cannot be delivered, for whatever reason. This
can be to the client or, more likely, as a message from the 'server' to
those that want to know.

A relatively unknown product called Reliable Transaction Router (RTR),
architected and developed long ago by DEC and still maintained and developed
by HP, warns, when it considers that a message *may* be a duplicate, i.e.,
has possibly been delivered previously, of the fact. This is also the case
when messages are being 'replayed' after a server has been brought down and
is now receiving messages which flowed through the network whilst it was
down.

There is much discussion around the word &quot;guaranteed&quot;, the objection being
that nothing can be &quot;guaranteed&quot;. Of course it cannot, but if we take things
to that extent, we may as well give up right away!
