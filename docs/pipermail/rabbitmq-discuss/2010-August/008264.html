<PRE>Alex,

Thank you for your reply.  We're building up our Erlang, Rabbit and
Mnesia knowledge and I'll pass along your reply to the rest of the
team.

cheers,
Aaron

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During the outage, the nodes were out of contact with each other for
</I>&gt;<i> so long that mnesia is worried about possible inconsistencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The simplest solution would be to take down 3 of the nodes and
</I>&gt;<i> restart them. &#160;This should allow them to sync with the fourth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's a longer explanation available here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/Mnesia_chap7.html#id2277661">http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/Mnesia_chap7.html#id2277661</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another 15 minutes later and the timedout errors were logged and that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was the end of the cluster; I think two of the nodes figured out how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to connect back to each other, but two others remained on their own.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The hosts and nodes themselves never shutdown, and when I restarted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just one of the nodes later in the day, the whole cluster rediscovered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> itself and all appeared to be well (`rabbitmqctl status` was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consistent with expectations).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So our first problem is that the nodes did not re-cluster after the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> second outage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this was caused by the inconsistent_database errors, there's not
</I>&gt;<i> much you can do apart from a restart of some of the nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once we corrected the cluster though, our applications
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still did not respond and we had to restart all of our clients.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Our clients all have a lot of handling for connection drops and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> channel closures, but most of them did not see any TCP disconnects to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their respective nodes. &#160;When the cluster was fixed, we found a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our queues missing (they weren't durable), and so we had to restart
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all of the apps to redeclare the queues. &#160;This still didn't fix our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> installation though, as our apps were receiving and processing data,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but responses were not being sent back out of our HTTP translators.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We have a single exchange, &quot;response&quot; that any application expecting a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> response can bind to. &#160;Our HTTP translators handle traffic from our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public endpoints, publish to various exchanges for the services we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offer, and those services in turn write back to the response exchange.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160;We have a monitoring tool that confirmed that these translators could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> write a response to its own Rabbit host and immediately receive it (a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ping, more or less). &#160;However, none of the responses from services
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which were connected to other Rabbit nodes were received by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> translators.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In short, it appeared that even though the cluster was healed and all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our services had re-declared their queues, the bindings between the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> response exchange and the queues which our translators use did not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appear to propagate to the rest of the nodes in the cluster.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That doesn't sound right. &#160;As you say, if the cluster was indeed
</I>&gt;<i> running, the queues/exhanges/bindings should have appeared on all of the
</I>&gt;<i> nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's possible that the rabbit nodes reconnected succesfully, but the
</I>&gt;<i> mnesia ones didn't. &#160;When a rabbitmq node detects another has gone
</I>&gt;<i> down, it automatically removes the queues declared on it from the
</I>&gt;<i> cluster. &#160;If the rabbit nodes think everything is fine, this removal
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't happen. &#160;As a result, rabbitmqctl might report
</I>&gt;<i> queues/exchanges/bindings that are actually unusable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So in summary,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Rabbit didn't re-connect to the other nodes after the second TCP disconnect
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We don't have any logic in the broker to recover from
</I>&gt;<i> inconsistent_database errors. &#160;Your best bet is probably to restart
</I>&gt;<i> all but one of the nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * After fixing the cluster (manually or automatically), Rabbit appears
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to have lost its non-durable queues even though the nodes never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stopped
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Although we had every indication that exchanges and queues were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still alive and functional, bindings appear to have been lost between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rabbit nodes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See above. &#160;The cluster may not have been completely repaired. &#160;Try
</I>&gt;<i> restarting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What we'd like to know is,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Does any of this make sense and can we add more detail to help fix any bugs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It makes some sense. &#160;Thanks for pointing this problem out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Have there been fixes for these issues since 1.7.2 that we should deploy?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not to this, sorry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Is there anything we should add/change about our applications to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deal with these types of situations?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you could do to prevent this. &#160;This is more of a
</I>&gt;<i> mnesia problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Alex
