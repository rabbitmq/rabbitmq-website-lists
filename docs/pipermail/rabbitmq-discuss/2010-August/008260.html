Hi James.

The new persister was in QA for a long time, and therefore had to be 
built from a branch in Mercurial. As of a week or so ago, it's been 
merged into default; you still have to build from Mercurial but from the 
default branch.

This also means it will be in the next release, so if you can wait 
that's certainly the easiest way to get it.

Assuming you're using a build with it in at all, there's no 
configuration to do: it just works.

Cheers, Simon
