<PRE>Ive said this before, but I will say it again:

+1 for official C library support. I would love to see this get done, and
obviously the sooner the better because I keep on having to tweak the PHP
extension all the time, and its getting old.
I mean, seriously, what do we pay you all this good money fo--

Oh. =)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (I fear some of the following has already been asked or noted, so please
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; bear with me if it has!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Responding to the &quot;rabbitmq-c or librabbitmq&quot; question: rabbitmq-c is
</I>&gt;<i> the name of its source code repository, following our convention for
</I>&gt;<i> other components of the RabbitMQ suite.  librabbitmq is the resulting
</I>&gt;<i> library you can build from that source code, following the Unix
</I>&gt;<i> convention for library names.  As well as the library, rabbitmq-c
</I>&gt;<i> includes some example code and command-line tools based on librabbitmq.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - rabbitmq-c or librabbitmq is termed experimental, which begs this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    obvious question: what does this mean?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It means that, although we are developing and maintaining it, it has not
</I>&gt;<i> yet received the degree of review that our officially supported client
</I>&gt;<i> libraries have (the Java and .NET ones).  So for instance, in the
</I>&gt;<i> process of such a review we might decide that significant changes are
</I>&gt;<i> required to the API exposed by the library.  We'd also like to see full
</I>&gt;<i> Windows support, so that it can be used on the same platforms as the
</I>&gt;<i> broker.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;experimental&quot; label is not a comment on its quality.  It is robust,
</I>&gt;<i> and many people are already using it.  Judged by the general standard of
</I>&gt;<i> AMQP client libraries out there, for all languages, it's in good shape.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Does the library support all the 0.9.1 requirements?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a 0-9-1 branch, that seems in good shape to be merged soon.  We
</I>&gt;<i> haven't done a careful conformance-checking pass against the spec, but
</I>&gt;<i> it seems unlikely that there are major areas of non-conformance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Does it support all RabbitMQ 1.8.1 functionality, e.g., flow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    control?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't yet support flow control.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Another way of putting it might be: is it as function-rich as the .NET
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    or Java libraries?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not quite.  As noted, flow control is missing.  It's also missing a few
</I>&gt;<i> less commonly used AMQP operations in its API (e.g. basic_reject,
</I>&gt;<i> basic_recover), though adding these would be trivial.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Is it, or will it be, supported?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The reason for asking is that we have a number of prospective clients who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; would benefit from using AMQP in general and RabbitMQ in particular.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; However, none of them have Erlang, none of them use Java or .NET, but all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; them have C/C++ or other high-level language code such as COBOL. If we are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to work with these clients we will need something a bit more reassuring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 'experimental'...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have also heard quite a bit of interest in librabbitmq from the kinds
</I>&gt;<i> of users who would appreciate the reassurance that declaring it
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;officially supported&quot; would bring.  So it is very likely that it will
</I>&gt;<i> become supported.  But we cannot yet commit to a time scale for when
</I>&gt;<i> that will happen.
