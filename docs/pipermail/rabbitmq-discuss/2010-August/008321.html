<PRE>Hi Ask -

I am a Pythonista and I have been looking into Celery, so this is very
cool that you have responded!

I was considering writing an x-script exchange for RabbitMQ and
creating one queue per worker to dump messages in; this is a feasible
way to go, right? The exchange could probably handle data locality,
however, what happens when a worker dies with messages sitting on the
queue?

I also am relatively new to the non-Amazon SQS message queuing world,
so I guess that this becomes less a question of how to do proper data
locality and more about how to do reliability with RabbitMQ. On SQS,
due to the visibility timeout semantics I am assured that if I design
idempotent tasks they will eventually occur even if there is a node
failure.

Right now, the solution that makes the most sense to me is to have a
single consumer that farms the tasks out to the worker nodes, however,
this means that I need to build reliability capabilities like
visibility timeouts into the consumer rather than relying on a battle
tested piece of software like RabbitMQ. Is there some sort of
functionality in RabbitMQ that accounts for this? Am I missing an
important piece of documentation somewhere?

Thanks,

Pete
