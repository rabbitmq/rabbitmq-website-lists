</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So basically what you are saying is that I can't have multiple consumers in the way I want? What about if I was building a stock ticker watcher - hundreds of clients viewing what is happening to the same 20 stocks? Its the same scenario. Would this be done in using the exchange mechnism you are proposing?
</I>
Of course you can. You just need to publish messages to &quot;exchanges&quot;
using meaningful routing keys and you need to create a single queue
for every web page view (or session). And use &quot;bindings&quot; to bind
together exchanges with queues (or use some similar architecture).
What you can't do is to publish a message _directly_ to the queue. As
this implies that only a single consumer will be able to pick it up.
It won't be duplicated. If you want it to be duplicated - use
exchanges. See the STOMP broadcast example.

Cheers,
