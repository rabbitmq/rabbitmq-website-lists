<PRE>Hello,

Is it possible to deliver messages to web applications hosted on IIS from the Rabbit broker running on windows? I have had a quick look at the rabbitmq-jsonrpc-channel however being on windows we can't really get this to build.

Is there anything else that might work with windows that I can look at?

Thanks!
