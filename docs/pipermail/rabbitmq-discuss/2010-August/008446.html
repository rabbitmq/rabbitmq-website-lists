<PRE>Alister,

&gt;<i> If a system is slowed to a crawl you can't know that it suddenly

until told otherwise, nothing is moving. Fundamentally different situations.

The memory condition that triggered channel.flow can clear just as 
quickly as any condition that caused a slow down.

&gt;<i> I remember being told years ago, never confuse an observed effect
</I>(i.e. the system /appears/ to have stopped) with what is defined to be
the case (i.e. we have been told to stop sending).

The &quot;appears to have stopped&quot; which is observable as a slow-down in TCP 
operations is actually a manifestation of a &quot;please stop sending&quot; signal 
from the TCP layer, or rather a &quot;I can't send any more because I've 
already sent as much as the other side can handle&quot; signal. [I am 
simplifying and paraphrasing here]. The network stack doesn't magically 
stop sending data / block callers; some event/condition has to trigger that.

The OP wanted to prevent their publishing threads from stalling. The 
techniques I suggested to the OP in my original reply deal with *all* 
conditions that can cause that to happen.


Regards,

Matthias.
