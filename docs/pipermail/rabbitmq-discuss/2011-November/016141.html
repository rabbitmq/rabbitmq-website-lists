Hi,
We are considering using RabbitMQ for a service that needs to exhibit high performance as well as reliability. The service is written in 3 languages (C, Java and Erlang).
There will be a single Java application, but this might have 3 RabbitMQ producers/consumers on different threads.
There will be 2 or 3 C applications (processes).
There will be 1 or 2 Erlang applications (all on the same Erlang VM).
A few questions:
1) Can the Erlang application(s) reside on the same VM as RabbitMQ? Is this recommended? In this case the Erlang app will have a NIF, and could be quite busy. How would you go about deploying this, can you just create an Erlang ez file and have RabbitMQ load it?
2) What is a typical configuration: Many exchanges, few queues? Or few exchanges with many queues? What are the rules of thumb in deciding how the exchange/queue layout is modeled?
3) What are the performance hits in using external exchanges? 
4) Can a queue be on a different node than an exchange?
5) This may sound like a really simple question, but I'm struggling with the idea of a broker. Is a broker a combination of exchange + queues, or is it a set of exchanges on the same Erlang VM?
Thanks, and looking forward to your responses
Matt
