<PRE>Hello, Matthew.

Thank you for the response and questions. See my comments in line.

Thank you,
Konstantin.

Each pair (publisher and consumer) works with a dedicated queue. So I
have 50 queues.

</I>
Topology is simple: publishers and consumers are distributed randomly
between RabbitMQ nodes. And they (publisher and consumers) can
reconnect to another node if there is an exception happens during
publishing/consuming with current connection.

</I>
Yes. You are right. I use Java client and QueueingConsumer.
Also I found a root-cause for my issue. Due to misprint in client
code, the queues were created without &quot;x-ha-policy&quot;. It's stupid but
it happened :) So my previous result was gained with non-mirrored
queues. I was really impressed when I found this. The cluster lost not
many messages in such condition.

Once I corrected the mistake the cluster works fine. Consumers don't
lose messages if a cluster node fails (stopped manually, Linux
rebooted and so on). Everything is delivered except one case.
If a node fails under heavy load on the cluster (CPU load is above
90-95% on cluster nodes) a few messages were lost anyway.  A publisher
submitted a message properly but a consumer never received it. I
repeated the test several times and it's reproducible. And now I'm
pretty confident that messages are lost in RabbitMQ (not in my
code :) )
I can spend my time on troubleshooting and better understanding of
what's happening. But I need some guidelines how I can approach with
it.
