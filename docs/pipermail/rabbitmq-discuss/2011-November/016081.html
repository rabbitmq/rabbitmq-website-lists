Cool!

RabbitMQ *clustering* does not work well if the network can be 
partitioned. That's really what we mean by &quot;avoid WAN clustering&quot;.

&gt;<i> with the Federation plugin becoming part of the distribution I believe
</I>&gt;<i> this may change
</I>&gt;<i> soon enough. Based on discussions I've read and participated in, I am a
</I>&gt;<i> bit confused
</I>&gt;<i> as to what is considered &quot;WAN Clustering&quot;.  In my mind, two machines (or
</I>&gt;<i> five) on
</I>&gt;<i> one public /29 would not be considered to be connected over the WAN,

No, if they're on the same network segment then you should be safe.

&gt;<i> however, I was
</I>&gt;<i> directed to the Federation plugin when I brought up connecting two
</I>&gt;<i> public IPs.
</I>
This may have been a misunderstanding.

&gt;<i> Can someone please define &quot;WAN Clustering&quot;, is it two machines connected
</I>&gt;<i> on separate
</I>&gt;<i> networks, in separate data centers?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Basically, as I understand it, because MCollective is pointed to an IP,
</I>&gt;<i> if that machine is down,
</I>&gt;<i> there is no failover...  Maybe I'm just going about it wrong.
</I>
You need to either:

* Make sure that your clients can connect to one of several machines, in 
case one goes down.

* Use an IP load balancer in front of the cluster.

&gt;<i> A co-worker (literally moments ago) pointed out RabbitMQ now has a HA
</I>&gt;<i> plugin that lays
</I>&gt;<i> on top of a Rabbit Cluster.  I'll investigate this further.
</I>
This mirrors queues across nodes in the cluster. Prior to 2.6.0 queues 
were always tied to one node in the cluster and could thus form a SPOF.

&gt;<i> The wisdom of the MCollective group is to use ActiveMQ.  This is not an
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable solution.
</I>
Clearly ;-)

Cheers, Simon
