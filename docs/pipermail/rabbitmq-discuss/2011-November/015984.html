<PRE>Nonetheless I think that the ability to avoid forwarding messages which have been &quot;shoveled&quot; already is something which would come really handy in the Shovel as well, to avoid infinite loops with symmetric shovels in use cases where the federation does not fit.

Federation pulls messages that are published to remote *exchanges*, with a certain degree of smarts about making sure that messages don't get forwarded from one broker to another only to be dropped, and with a bit of control about how much messages get forwarded.

Shovel pulls or pushes messages from queues to exchanges. That's all.

So they have different purposes. I see the shovel as being a low-level
tool: move messages from here to here. What you do with that is up to you.

Federation is a more opinionated tool: it's specifically for the case when you want an exchange that acts as though it's in a bunch of different brokers simultaneously.

If the shovel is working for you, you don't need to move away from it; it's not going anywhere.

Cheers, Simon
