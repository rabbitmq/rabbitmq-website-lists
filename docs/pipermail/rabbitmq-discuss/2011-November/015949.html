<PRE>Hi guys,

I've installed the RabbitMQ admin panel on our servers, and it doesn't seem 
to work as expected.

If I go to the list of exchange, or queues, or anything, and click on one 
of the objects there, I get this message for them all:

Not found

The object you clicked on was not found; it may have been deleted on the 
server.

They definitely exist, as I can use the command line tool to view them and 
get the required info on them. The 2 servers this is failing on are ubuntu. 
If I run it locally on my OSX Lion box, all is good.

One problem may be that it is running behind nginx, and I've had to do some 
url rewrite to get it to work. I'm not really an ngix guru, and this is 
probably not the place to ask about this, but here is the location that 
I've cobbled together to get it (mostly) working:

location /rabbitadmin {
        proxy_pass              <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1:55672;">http://127.0.0.1:55672;</A>
        proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header        Host $http_host;
        rewrite ^/rabbitadmin/(.*)$ /$1 break;
      }

Help appreciated!

Regards,
Raymond Barlow
