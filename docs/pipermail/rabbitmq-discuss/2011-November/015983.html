Federation pulls messages that are published to remote *exchanges*, with 
a certain degree of smarts about making sure that messages don't get 
forwarded from one broker to another only to be dropped, and with a bit 
of control about how much messages get forwarded.

Shovel pulls or pushes messages from queues to exchanges. That's all.

So they have different purposes. I see the shovel as being a low-level 
tool: move messages from here to here. What you do with that is up to you.

Federation is a more opinionated tool: it's specifically for the case 
when you want an exchange that acts as though it's in a bunch of 
different brokers simultaneously.

If the shovel is working for you, you don't need to move away from it; 
it's not going anywhere.

Cheers, Simon
