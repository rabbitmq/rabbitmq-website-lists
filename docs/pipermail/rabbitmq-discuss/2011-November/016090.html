<PRE>Thanks for your note. Please use the rabbitmq-discuss mailing list.

Unfortunately, we have a lot of different pieces of documentation, generated from
code changes, markdown, xml, docbook and so on (see below).  [A valid response to
this point is 'you can't get there from here.']

In my limited experience, docbook comes with other issues, but we should
properly look into this.

Thank you for pointing out the formatting problems in the NDocProc-generated
API guide for the C# .NET client. I have raised a bug for this.
