<PRE>To help out maybe I can give you the exact topology of our rabbit instances.

We have 6 RabbitMQ servers in remote servers. Then we have 2 local
RabbitMQ servers local to a cluster of 2 more RabbitMQ servers. Each
of these servers is on its own box.

The 8 RabbitMQ standalone servers are using the shovel plugin to send
data across the network to the Cluster of 2 RabbitMQ servers. The
shovel is set to prefetch 1000 messages and as you said is just
forwarding the acks from the cluster as confirms. Each one of these 8
RabbitMQs has threads that are writing messages sometimes 100 at a
time sometimes 1 at a time. The channel is set to confirm so they wait
for confirms from the 8 RabbitMQs.

The shovel seems to only be able to send about 100/200 messages a
second to the cluster and so we see it back up considerably whenever
messages are produced at a higher rate than this. Not all of the 8
servers produce messages higher than 100/s but the two that are local
in the same datacenter often will.

Like I said earlier the cluster is x-ha policy set to &quot;all&quot; so that
the messages are mirrored from the master to the slave. Then there are
about 40 consumer threads consuming from the cluster. Each of these
threads opens 1 connection, and then creates 1 channel. They are set
to prefetch 1000 messages and then send acks in batches up to 100
(depending on if there was 100 messages to be read within a 500ms
timeout).

Maybe this will help you replicate it?
