Sorry, I wasn't clear or thorough. I don't know if they were backing up or
not, because I turned it all up and moved on to other things. It might have
been backing up or delayed without tipping the server over; I wasn't
watching until the engineers using it notified me that they were seeing
delay.

 2.) Load increased, by as much as 2x depending on time of day

Yeah, that's my complaint (really, more of an observation).  I would hope
it could be within a few percent of AMQP or even faster since the protocol
is smaller &amp; simpler, but I totally understand why RabbitMQ chose to back
it on AMQP.

I'm pretty sure I've pushed way more messages through RabbitMQ+STOMP
before, but that was a couple years ago at another company, and also on
rather nice bare metal so it's an unfair comparison.

&quot;Rabbit's stomp processing is a fair bit slower than handling AMQP&quot; is what
I suspected and is a satisfactory answer.

Thanks,
-Al
