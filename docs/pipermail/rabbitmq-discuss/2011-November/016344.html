<PRE>Hey Steve,

Thanks for the heads up. I can understand that you want to keep the internal stuff internal and not have to maintain it for external consumers.

The reason why we were using it was for a test that uses a patched version of the tracer, so basically we had an import from there.

Having said that, I should maybe look at the new version of the tracer to see of we can just re-patch that, which may save us from monkey patching the assembler (or the code that links against it).

BTW I was wondering under what circumstances you were seeing race conditions in this section of the library. Of late, we've seen a few oddities at some loads (ca. 2000 shovel out-ins/sec) but it is difficult to reproduce and we always just assumed it was a bug in the threading of our shovel.

Cheers,

Ben

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it was a conscious decision -- it goes with the concurrency and

</I>&gt;<i> now different, and the use of Assembler is limited entirely to the AMQCommand
</I>&gt;<i> class in the new code.

</I>&gt;<i> Can you explain how you were using Assembler? We would also be interested in how
