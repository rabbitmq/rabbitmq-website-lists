<PRE>Hi:

Can you say a bit more about what precisely you were doing?

Also, have you consulted the tutorial series available here?

<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-java.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-java.html</A>

There you'll see an AMQP basic.publish of a message.  The basicPublish(...)
method on the Java client's Channel class is javadoc'ed here:

<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-java-client/v2.6.1/rabbitmq-java-client-javadoc-2.6.1/com/rabbitmq/client/Channel.html#basicPublish(java.lang.String,">http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-java-client/v2.6.1/rabbitmq-java-client-javadoc-2.6.1/com/rabbitmq/client/Channel.html#basicPublish(java.lang.String,</A> java.lang.String, com.rabbitmq.client.AMQP.BasicProperties, byte[])

AMQP message bodies are binary data.  What you choose to use for this data 
is up to you.  When you say you tried to send a Java &quot;class object&quot; as a 
&quot;RabbitMQ message,&quot; what did you actually do?  If you're planning to 
serialize raw Java POJOs for sending you'll have to marshal them into 
some format that the other end can deal with.  In many ways, this isn't
a terribly good idea, and will limit the generality of your design perhaps
unnecessarily (for example, what if a consumer isn't written in Java?  Or
doesn't have the right versions of whatever you were serializing on its 
classpath?  And that's even before you get into the security, safety and
correctness issues that come along with extralinguistic object creation 
schemes).  

It might be worth thinking a bit further about the meaning and intent of 
what you're wanting to communicate between your producers and consumers 
and choosing some format that both can deal with.  Then we can help you 
get down to brass tacks and the nitty gritty of actually transmitting it?

Best regards,
Jerry

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Rabbitmq message?


How many type of rabbitmq message?I tried to send and receive an Java class object as a Rabbitmq message but I failed? I read the rabbitmq example and I realized that all the messages has String type. 
Could any one help me?
