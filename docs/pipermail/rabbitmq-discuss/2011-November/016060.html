<PRE>Hello All,

I'm looking to implement an MCollective platform in my data center.
I would like to use a High Availability RabbitMQ cluster as we already have
RabbitMQ
implementations and I feel that it is a far superior product to other MQs
on the market.

I understand that RabbitMQ doesn't work well over a WAN connection yet,
however,
with the Federation plugin becoming part of the distribution I believe this
may change
soon enough. Based on discussions I've read and participated in, I am a bit
confused
as to what is considered &quot;WAN Clustering&quot;.  In my mind, two machines (or
five) on
one public /29 would not be considered to be connected over the WAN,
however, I was
directed to the Federation plugin when I brought up connecting two public
IPs.
Can someone please define &quot;WAN Clustering&quot;, is it two machines connected on
separate
networks, in separate data centers?

My second question is about HA Clusters and MCollective specifically.

I drew this picture to illustrate my problem. <A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/Ms0mv.png">http://i.imgur.com/Ms0mv.png</A>

Basically, as I understand it, because MCollective is pointed to an IP, if
that machine is down,
there is no failover...  Maybe I'm just going about it wrong.

A co-worker (literally moments ago) pointed out RabbitMQ now has a HA
plugin that lays
on top of a Rabbit Cluster.  I'll investigate this further.

The wisdom of the MCollective group is to use ActiveMQ.  This is not an
acceptable solution.

In the mean time, I am way off here?  Does anyone have a suggestion to
solve the HA problem
with MCollective?


Thanks,
Jon
