Hmm. There's nothing wrong with the entries in the logs. I'm not sure
whether it's just &quot;doing what it's meant to be doing&quot; or whether there's
a bug - sure, the hogging of CPU is undesireable, but I don't know
whether the cause of that is a bug or whether it's just some unoptimal
algorithm.

Could you describe accurately what your tests are so that we can try and
reproduce?
