Ok, if it's that simple to trigger then it shouldn't take too long for
me to reproduce it. I've certainly seen the slaves take some time to
catch up - the master-&gt;slave communication is done asynchronously
deliberately to stop the slowest-slave dictating the pace, and it can
create such backlogs, but we've introduced shortcuts for queue deletion
elsewhere, and I'd imagine we could do the same in a few places in the
HA queues stuff.

&gt;<i> Previously we've had queues in a steady state, with approximately 25,000

</I>
Argh. That number of unacked messages might be a problem. I'm not sure
at this stage, but it's possible there are some places where we're just
using the wrong datastructures to deal with that sort of scenario. I'll
take a look after a snooze.

&gt;<i> It all gets out of sync after that.
</I>
Well, it shouldn't. I still suspect it might eventually recover, but it
might take the heat-death of the universe before it gets there.

&gt;<i> I might be able to give you a better test case once we've pushed our non-HA
</I>&gt;<i> release out and I have a bit more time.
</I>
That'd be very kind, but I'll prod it myself in the meantime.

Thanks,

Matthew
