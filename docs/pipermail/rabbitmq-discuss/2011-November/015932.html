<PRE>OK - will upgrade and see if that removes the RAM problem.

Thanks for your help,
Michael.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and 'queues' them itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, although the &quot;queueing&quot; doesn't mean there's an explicit queue in
</I>&gt;<i> the client. But messages can back up in networking buffers etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will try to set QoS/prefetch_count to 1,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though I seem to remember
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having read that this can cause trouble. I would assume that it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be no problem, have you got any thoughts on whether it's a good idea?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see why it should cause trouble. Setting prefetch to 1 does mean
</I>&gt;<i> that throughput will drop since the broker cannot deliver another
</I>&gt;<i> message until the previous one has been acknowledged, so if throughput
</I>&gt;<i> is a concern then you might set the prefetch to some larger number for
</I>&gt;<i> less fairness but more performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general setting the prefetch count is a good idea if you're concerned
</I>&gt;<i> with fair distribution of messages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I wrote earlier, we have a number (several thousand) of files to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process, each of which may contain up to several hundred thousand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; records (around 2KB each).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In an earlier test, I let the processes handling files push the ID of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each record to a queue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Simply add a publish to the above code after the ack). The consumer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for this queue (which uses autoack)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Of course, setting prefetch doesn't do anything in noack mode since the
</I>&gt;<i> server has no way to know how many messages have made it all the way to
</I>&gt;<i> the client.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would do a lookup in a Postgresql
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DB, and nothing else.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After about 50 million records, the vm_memory_high_watermark would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set, and shortly after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that, I got&lt;&quot;timeout waiting for channel.flow_ok{active=false}&quot;,none}
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; . Eventually the whole system froze.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess this timeout is caused by my client not reacting to the flow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control from the RabbitMQ server. Is that correct? Unfortunately, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client I use does not have methods for that. Should I expect to handle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this in normal operation, or could it be handled by a client for me?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you said you were using 1.8.1. Much has changed since then:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * We no longer use channel.flow to throttle producers since as you're
</I>&gt;<i> seeing many clients did not implement it correctly / at all. We now use
</I>&gt;<i> TCP backpressure instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Prior to 2.0 all messages in all queues had to fit in memory. Messages
</I>&gt;<i> are now paged to disk when memory is low.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I would strongly advise you to upgrade to 2.6.1. It's available in
</I>&gt;<i> our apt repository:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Oh, and the big question: Is it out of the question to handle approx.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 300 mill. messages (where payload is essentially a bigint) over a few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; days?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That should be no big deal. My workstation can churn through that in a
</I>&gt;<i> few hours.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers, Simon
