<PRE>Hi Emile,

Thanks for your reply and for your help. 

I will try to with this example and let you know. 

But my main concern is about development in android. Since Java is not my background, so I was searching for a example which is directly in android.

Thanks
Manisha

If you have one application that is based on the RabbitMQ Java client
then you should look at the Java tutorials for examples of how to
combine multiple applications using a variety of standard patterns:
