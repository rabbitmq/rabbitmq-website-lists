<PRE>Hey Steve,

</I>&gt;<i> (Pun intended).

No, the question is on the current executing thread :-)

To be clear, the code I am talking about is this:
<A HREF="https://github.com/lshift/accent/blob/master/src/test/java/net/lshift/accent/ControlledConnectionProxy.java">https://github.com/lshift/accent/blob/master/src/test/java/net/lshift/accent/ControlledConnectionProxy.java</A>

It's basically a patched version of the tracer out of the official
Rabbit library, which is why it has your copyright headers on it.

I ran into the issue with the visibility of the assembler when trying
to uprev this patched from ControlledConnectionProxy 2.6.1 to 2.7.0.

</I>
The races I _think_ I have seen have been with the main client
library. However, without being able to reproduce them reliably, I'm
not going to troll a public mailing list with insinuations which are
most likely to be due to bugs in our own code. I was merely asking
whether there was any general background characteristics that caused
you guys to make the library thread safe, or was it just a case of
doing so being the right thing to do.

Cheers,

Ben
