<PRE>Dear John,

Well, there are a lot of strange things about this code; and it is not very
good Java, to be honest (it calls protected methods in its constructor for one
thing). I guess I'd like to re-write it. The protected methods seem to encourage
you to sub-class it, for instance. In general I'm not keen on subclassing
as a user API, unless it is very carefully controlled (as in Consumer),
and in this case it would be easy to break things.
 
&gt;<i> I am using extensively routing facilities of amqp, and I need to manage

</I>&gt;<i> and a private queue is cheap enough to be done tens of time per second?)
</I>
The overhead of an RpcClient creation is non-trivial; but the creation of the
private (reply)queue is essential, so that we can't get away from that. Tens of
times a second ought to be easy, though.  Creating a channel each time would
be a serious problem -- don't do that.  Multiple consumers on the same channel
are OK (there's even a way to beef up the callback threads in 2.7.0)
and ought to perform well.

Having thousands of RPCs on a single channel at once might be pushing
it, though.

&gt;<i> I guess you designed this RpcClient class more as an example, to be customized?
</I>&gt;<i> That's fine but code of RpcClient is not that simple and I would have prefered
</I>&gt;<i> not to maintain that kind of risky low-level things...
</I>
Yes, I agree. It certainly is just an example. A simpler and cleaner one suited to
your needs should be derived from it.
 
&gt;<i> Would you consider putting a primitiveCall(String exchange, String routingKey,
</I>&gt;<i> AMQP.BasicProperties props, byte[] message) in a future release?
</I>
Yes; but I would like to clean up RpcClient before that. I'd be delighted with
any comments from the field.
