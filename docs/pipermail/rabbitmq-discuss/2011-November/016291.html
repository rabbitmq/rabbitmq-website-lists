This is rather OS-dependent. Are we talking about Linux?

On Linux (by default, because on Linux everything's configurable) IPv4 
is considered to be a tiny subrange of IPv6. Since we added IPv6 support 
in 2.3.1 we listen on &quot;::&quot; by default (i.e. all IPv6 addresses) and IPv4 
is included in that. This means that some OS tools might report 
connections as being IPv6 when they are &quot;really&quot; IPv4.

On other OSes (and Linux when it's been configured differently) we 
listen on both &quot;::&quot; and 0.0.0.0. We can't do that on default-Linux 
because binding to 0.0.0.0 fails.

</I>
Anyway, yes you can use RABBITMQ_NODE_IP_ADDRESS to force the server to 
use IPv4 only, or add something like

  {tcp_listeners, [{5672, &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;}]}

to rabbitmq.config.

I would like to figure out why this isn't working for you though - the 
TCP6 thing *should* be a red herring. Could this have been some 
transient problem that went away by coincidence? Or am I being optimistic?

&gt;<i> I have installed the rabbitmq 2.6.1 version, the client is Kombu python
