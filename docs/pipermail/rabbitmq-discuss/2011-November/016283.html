</I>I see, if the connection fails we don't use the ExecutorService. Which
means you are free to use it on another connection attempt.

</I>I think I see your point.

It might be possible to arrange that we do not shutdown client-supplied
Services, only our own private ones.  Would that be appropriate?
We would then have to relax some of the callback contract on termination.

</I>I presume you mean if you throw an exception in a consumer callback?
The answer is Yes, that is what is supposed to happen, so we didn't
change the behaviour.

We actually call the 
ExceptionHandler.handleConsumerException() method, in general.
And an ExceptionHandler can be set on the AMQConnection constructor.
This parameter is not exposed on the newConnection() (or ConnectionFactory)
interface.  These are all impl classes.

In fact, this whole thread highlights how tricky the ConnectionFactory
interface is. We are minded to deprecate the whole lot and use a Builder
interface instead. This would allow named parameter extensions rather
easily, and make it trivial to explain the interactions between, say, uri()
and host()/port() settings.  We could also add extra parameters without
requiring recoding callers, or adding lots of constructors. It would be
trivial to expose an ExceptionHandler on such an interface.

Let us know your thoughts.
