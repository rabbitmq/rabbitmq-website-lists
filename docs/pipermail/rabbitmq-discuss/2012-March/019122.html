Hi.

This is normal in a cluster upgrade - the upgrade works by breaking the 
cluster on the first node to start, and then having other nodes rejoin.

Do you actually mean rabbitmq.conf? The file is usually called 
rabbitmq.config.

&gt;<i> Then, when I try to start up node2 and node3,
</I>&gt;<i> they both give out the following message in /var/log/rabbit/startup_log:

</I>&gt;<i> [<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">root at mq2</A> /etc/rabbitmq]# cat /var/log/rabbitmq/startup_log

</I>&gt;<i> 6 plugins activated:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ****
</I>&gt;<i> Cluster upgrade needed but this is a ram node.
</I>&gt;<i> Please first start the last disc node to shut down.
</I>&gt;<i> ****
</I>
So this implies that they think no other cluster nodes are running.

Assuming the config file is really /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config, the 
only way I can think of for this to happen is if the cluster config file 
itself is corrupt / empty. What does 
/var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/cluster_nodes.config (I think that's the path) 
contain on the RAM nodes? It should contain the same list of nodes as 
are in rabbitmq.config.

Cheers, Simon
