<PRE>Alexis,

Thank you for your help.

Sorry for not cross-posting as you indicated. Truth be told, I did not know about the erlang-questions list.

I had, in fact, read the RPM page to which you refer. I came away thinking that the EPEL package for Erlang still(?) contains a relatively old version thereof. Can you clarify the status of this package, e.g., is it possible to get an EPEL with 15B?

Finally, I happened upon the &quot;Erlang Solutions&quot; website and late Friday sent them an e-mail asking about what it would cost to get a CentOS 6.2 compatible Erlang binary. But, looking now more closely at this site, it seems that the packages they make available are free. Bug fixes and general support will incur costs.

Am I right to think that, for CentOS, I should be looking at this part of the download page:

    RPM-based Linux distributions
    RPM packages are signed. To add Erlang Solutions key to execute command:

    # rpm --import <A HREF="http://binaries.erlang-solutions.com/debian/erlang_solutions.ascUsers">http://binaries.erlang-solutions.com/debian/erlang_solutions.ascUsers</A> of Fedora can add this file to /etc/yum.repos.d/

    Users of Centos can add this file to /etc/yum.repos.d/ (RPM Forge must be also added to repos)

Again, thanks.

-Paul

Paul,

Let me try to help

Though, please note that suggested improvement to erlang.org should be
cross-posted to erlang-questions ;-)

YES; indeed lots of people use Rabbit with CentOS, Fedora, and of course RHEL.

If erlang.org's approach is not to your liking, another trusted
distribution point is Erlang Solutions.  They are &quot;the&quot; third party
commercial support provider for Erlang.  They provide distributions
too.  You can get 32 bit and 64 bit bundles for CentOS, Debian,
Fedora, MacOSX, OpenSUSE, Ubuntu, Windows and &quot;Linux&quot;, all from here:
<A HREF="http://www.erlang-solutions.com/section/132/download-erlang-otp">http://www.erlang-solutions.com/section/132/download-erlang-otp</A>

I assume you have also seen our RPMs page here:
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html</A>   Note that provides a RHEL
option using EPEL.  A general issue with RHEL, for any software, can
be that you need access to many dependencies; some corporate firewalls
block this.  A complete, hardened, RHEL binary could be created; we
don't provide one currently.

I can also tell you that older Windows, Gentoo, Solaris, OpenSolaris,
AIX, OpenVMS, and I think HP-UX are all doable and in most of these
cases you will find help for each on this list.
