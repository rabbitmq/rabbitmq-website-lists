<PRE>I figure I must have missed *something*, but I sure can't figure out what.
I have tried the RabbitMQ Management Plugin from both Firefox and IE on my
Windows 7 x64 system and the adding a user does not behave as I expect it
would/should.

First I took my IE, turned off every sort of &quot;safety feature&quot; I could find,
but when I click on any of the links below the &quot;Tags&quot; field, it changes to
a blank screen except for the text *[object Object]* at the top.  If I
watch VERY carefully when I click I see that it populates the field with
the string *administrator*, but then the blank screen except for the
text *[object
Object]* appears.

If I do the same thing with Firefox (though not necessarily as &quot;wide
open&quot;), it does not switch to a blank screen, but near as I can tell,
nothing happens at all.  I double-checked to make sure that I permitted
pop-ups, and then it behaves like I described for IE.



Next it seems somewhat confusing (at least to me) that the label below the
Tags field shows [Admin]..., but the *actual* valid tag values list the
string *administrator.  *Note:  full word... and all lower case.



Next it seems somewhat strange that no mechanism exists to CHANGE a user's
tags after the user gets created.  You can clear permissions, change
permissions, or delete the user, but nothing else.  To change the tags it
looks like you have to delete the user and create it again.



Finally I find it somewhat surprising that the form provides no way to
reset/remove a user password.  It appears that you can only accomplish this
by deleting the user and then creating a new user.
