OK, that's alarming.

&gt;<i> Anyone else seen this?  Is service rabbitmq-server stop sufficient to

</I>
There was a racy bug in a previous release that did this. That should 
really be fixed though. &quot;service rabbitmq-server stop&quot; should be fine.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I don't have the log messages from machineB's
</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmq-server because it appears that they get overwritten upon

</I>
Unfortunately it's not easy for us to debug problems without them...

They really should get appended to rather than overwritten though (well 
apart from the stdout/err logs) - are you sure you don't have them?

Cheers, Simon
