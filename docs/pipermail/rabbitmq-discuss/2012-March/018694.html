<PRE>Jerry, thank you.

But let me make sure I understand: user names and passwords are NOT in rabbitmq.config; for Windows, rabbitmq.config will be in %APPDATA%\RabbitMQ\.

I see no rabbitmq.config in %APPDATA%\RabbitMQ\. I can only conclude from this that its presence is not required if all default configuration values are in effect (my case, I think).

Here's what's behind my question: I am thinking about the use of site-specific passwords, i.e., I don't want to ship a product to multiple customers and have these multiple instances of Rabbit share a common password for a fixed username. 

Let's suppose that I have a means of generating, encrypting, and saving to disk a site-specific password for this fixed Rabbit user (maybe the username, common to all installations, is &quot;syncsortRabbit&quot; - whatever). Rabbit login code would then have to read the password from disk, decrypt it, and then convey it via connectionFactory.setPassword().

From another perspective, I cannot distribute a product whose Rabbit component has a pre-configured user all of whose passwords are identical. That is, each copy can have user &quot;syncsortRabbit&quot; and each can have an initial fixed password, but I would need a way to change that password to make it site-specific.

Perhaps, after generating a site-specific password, I could accomplish this via rabbitmqctl add_user.....?

Grateful for any ideas - thanks.

-Paul

Hi, Paul:

User names and passwords are actually stored in the Erlang/OTP
Mnesia database that Rabbit uses.  Its location in the filesystem
varies depending on what platform you're running on, and whether
you've told it to go somewhere other than its platform specific
default.

The details by platform are summarized here:

<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html</A>

On Windows you'll find the rabbitmq.config file, which you'd use
if you wanted to move Mnesia elsewhere in %RABBITMQ_BASE%.

Best regards,
Jerry

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Configuring Users






Hi All, 



I have RabbitMQ running on a Windows Server 2008 R2 box. 



I for the first time tried to add a new user. Seems to have worked, I can login to that user, etc. 



I though, perhaps wrongly, that in response to adding a user I would see a rabbit.config file created (or updated) somewhere on my C:\ drive. I have noticed some RabbitMQ config info kept in C:\...\AppData\Roaming\RabbitMQ. But I can find no evidence of a rabbitmq.config file anywhere on the C:\ drive. 



Can someone tell me where RabbitMQ keeps user and password info? 



Thanks. 



-Paul
