Yeah, this is a bug on that page on recent IE/FF. It's fixed in the 
upcoming release. You can work around it by typing in the tags.

&gt;<i> Next it seems somewhat confusing (at least to me) that the label below
</I>&gt;<i> the Tags field shows [Admin]..., but the */actual/* valid tag values
</I>&gt;<i> list the string *administrator. *Note:  full word... and all lower case.
</I>
Yeah, the shortening was done to control the amount of space the links 
take up.

&gt;<i> Next it seems somewhat strange that no mechanism exists to CHANGE a
</I>&gt;<i> user's tags after the user gets created.  You can clear permissions,
</I>&gt;<i> change permissions, or delete the user, but nothing else.  To change the
</I>&gt;<i> tags it looks like you have to delete the user and create it again.
</I>
No, you can, although it's not very clear. You need to enter the new 
details with the same username into the &quot;add / update a user&quot; form. Some 
better UI for this is on the TODO list.

&gt;<i> Finally I find it somewhat surprising that the form provides no way to
</I>&gt;<i> reset/remove a user password.  It appears that you can only accomplish
</I>&gt;<i> this by deleting the user and then creating a new user.
</I>
Again, new details, same username.

Cheers, Simon
