Hi Paul:

1. Yes, the spill-over happens regardless of your durability specifications.
Think of it as analogous to an OS with virtual memory and swapping, writing
pages to disk when physical RAM becomes precious:  You didn't ask for that
data to end up on disk, but it's being moved there temporarily due to need.
Note that this spilling of memory to disk is a RabbitMQ broker mechanism, not
an operating system one.

2. It's automatically handled by Rabbit, in response to the broker's memory
usage going above a configured fraction of the total memory available to the
Erlang VM.  That fraction, the &quot;memory high watermark,&quot; can be adjusted in
your RabbitMQ configuration but generally one should trust the default.  If
it's set too low, messages may swap out to disk prematurely, and if it's set
too high, the mechanism may not engage until the broker is in significant
memory jeopardy.

Best regards,
Jerry

Emile,

Thanks for the x-message-ttl info.

A couple of questions about your prior e-mail where you said &quot;queues may get very long and need to spill over to disk...&quot;

1. Am I right to think that this &quot;spill over&quot; happens for non-durable exchanges and queues?
2. Is there a way to govern when that spill over occurs, e.g., when queue gets to a certain size, or is this auto-magically handled by Rabbit?

-Paul

Hi Paul,

Yes, these are simply queue arguments. Spring AMQP allows you to declare
queues with arguments.

&gt;<i> On a related matter, please consider the case where the consumers

</I>
Yes, by default such messages will be discarded.

You can have such messages sent to an alternative exchange by using the
&quot;alternative exchange&quot; extension:
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#alternate-exchange">http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#alternate-exchange</A>

Also see the &quot;mandatory&quot; publish argument:
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.publish.mandatory">http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#basic.publish.mandatory</A>
Publishers can have messages returned if they could not be routed.
