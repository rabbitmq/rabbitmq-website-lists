<PRE>I agree... but it's not a politically correct thing to say.  ;-)  There
were people around in the 50s and 60s doing smart stuff in memory
constrained environments.  I have heard of research papers from that time
frame being referenced for work now.  It's very retro.  Though under the
radar, thankfully it isn't completely unappreciated.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; If you are pushing around binary, what's the method of providing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; identity to Riak via a message?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You can either let it use the exchange name as the bucket and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; routing key as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Riak key, or you can specify them in a message header
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (X-Riak-Bucket and X-Riak-Key respectively).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which rabbit tag do &quot;X-Riak-Bucket&quot; and &quot;X-Riak-Key&quot; these fit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inside?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If using the Java client, you'd pass in arbitrary headers using the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;AMQP.BasicProperties.Builder.headers(Map)&quot; method: <A HREF="http://bit.ly/A4CWu3">http://bit.ly/A4CWu3</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Ruby, you'd pass them on the publish: &quot;exchange.publish(msg, :headers
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; { &quot;X-Riak-Bucket&quot; =&gt; &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;X-Riak-Key&quot; =&gt; &quot;fookey&quot; })&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Last time I explored this BerkeleyDB was the solution...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; now I don't know the space well enough to form a solid opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It has been a while, then! Things are much different in some ways and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not so much in others. How's that for an informative answer? ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really really helpful. Once there was &quot;internet time&quot;, are you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; measuring in NOSQL-time? In normal time, not that long. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, NoSQL time is like dog years, only in months. So 7 months in NoSQL
</I>&gt;<i> time is like 7 years anywhere else! :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, there's lots and lots of things that haven't changed in 30
</I>&gt;<i> years. When you get down to it, it's still a key/value lookup and some
</I>&gt;<i> things are very similar to what we were doing many years ago writing COBOL
</I>&gt;<i> programs on CICS/mainframes. A few years ago, I worked pretty closely with
</I>&gt;<i> some RPG programmers (AS/400) and they were pretty frustrated with our
</I>&gt;<i> boss, who was trying to get them to learn to embed SQL into their programs
</I>&gt;<i> (which they really hated...can't say as I blamed them...it was much uglier
</I>&gt;<i> and didn't work as well as using a &quot;set lower limit&quot; and CHAIN) and just
</I>&gt;<i> about the time they're starting to get the hang of that, I started talking
</I>&gt;<i> about using NoSQL in our apps and they rightly recognized that that's
</I>&gt;<i> exactly what they'd been doing for decades!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The new kids think this stuff is all flashy and fancy and uber-modern and
</I>&gt;<i> us old fogeys (that is, those of us just barely over 35 ;) see this as
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat of a cyclic return to a simpler and more effective way to handle
</I>&gt;<i> data that isn't altogether different from what it was like when we first
</I>&gt;<i> started writing PC apps using FoxPro and dBase. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
