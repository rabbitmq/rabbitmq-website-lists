Glen,

There aren't any specific guidelines about connections vs channels.
Depending on the application, it may be more convenient to use
multiple connections or channels. Use what is more convenient.

Of course, if possible you should reduce number of
connections - connections consume constrained resources
(file descriptors).


Having said that there is one particular case when you could
benefit from having multiple connections.

In a situation when RabbitMQ runs of memory (high memory
watermark), it will stop accepting new messages. But due to the
limitations of AMQP protocol, it can't  be done on per-channel
basis - a full connection will be stopped in such case.

To rephrase - when rabbit runs out of memory the connections
on which messages are being published will be temporarily
throttled. You won't be able to do anything on that connection
until rabbit recovers - that includes consuming messages.

So, if you wish to be shielded against this situation, you
may want to keep publishers on a separate connection
than consumers. That will ensure that even in the
out-of-memory case the consumers will be able to do their
job (and thus help rabbitmq free memory faster)

Hope that helps,
  Marek
