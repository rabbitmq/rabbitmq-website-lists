<PRE>Hi, Paul:  You could use the management HTTP API to keep a track on
queue depths and then have your producer dynamically adjust its 
behavior if it notices that consumption isn't keeping up, but you
should really think about whether this is something you want to do.

It ends up building a lot of of hand holding awareness of the messaging
mechanics into your endpoint applications, which in some ways goes against
the spirit of using a messaging service in between your producers and
consumers in the first place.  You might be better off monitoring the
system, and spinning up additional consumers to drain especially busy 
queues than building the sort of logic you describe...

Best regards,
Jerry

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Throttling when Fast Producer, Slow Consumer

Hi All,

What are the Rabbit &quot;best practices&quot; ways of handling a situation where the consumer is v-e-r-y slow and the producer is super-fast. IOW: I am trying to understand the best ways to throttle the producer in such a case. Assume that neither queue nor its topic exchange are durable.

Can producer obtain information about the state of the queue, e.g., the number of unACKed messages, its size in bytes or number of messages, etc? Or is another approach indicated?

Thanks very much.

-Paul
