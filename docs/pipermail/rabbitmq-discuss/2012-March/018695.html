<PRE>Hi, Paul... answers inline:

&gt;<i> But let me make sure I understand: user names and passwords are NOT in 
</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmq.config; for Windows, rabbitmq.config will be in %APPDATA%\RabbitMQ\.
</I>
By default, that shoudl be the case, yes.

&gt;<i> I see no rabbitmq.config in %APPDATA%\RabbitMQ\. I can only conclude from this that &gt; its presence is not required if all default configuration values are in effect (my case, I &gt; think).
</I>
Rabbit can live without a file there.  If you enable RABBITMQ_CONSOLE_LOG as per this page:

<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html</A>

you can look at the RabbitMQ startup blurb.  It will print a line prefaced with &quot;config file(s):&quot; that will tell you what, if any config files it used when starting up.  See the &quot;Verify Configuration&quot; of the above page for details.

&gt;<i> Here's what's behind my question: I am thinking about the use of site-specific
</I>&gt;<i> passwords, i.e., I don't want to ship a product to multiple customers and have these
</I>&gt;<i> multiple instances of Rabbit share a common password for a fixed username.
</I>
Sounds very reasonable.

&gt;<i> Let's suppose that I have a means of generating, encrypting, and saving to disk a
</I>&gt;<i> site-specific password for this fixed Rabbit user (maybe the username, common to all &gt; installations, is &quot;syncsortRabbit&quot; - whatever). Rabbit login code would then have 
</I>&gt;<i> to read
</I>&gt;<i> the password from disk, decrypt it, and then convey it via
</I>&gt;<i> connectionFactory.setPassword().
</I>
And also of course get an appropriate user created in the broker with known name and matching password, but yes indeed.

&gt;<i> From another perspective, I cannot distribute a product whose Rabbit component has a &gt; pre-configured user all of whose passwords are identical. That is, each copy can have &gt; user &quot;syncsortRabbit&quot; and each can have an initial fixed password, but I would need a &gt; way to change that password to make it site-specific.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps, after generating a site-specific password, I could accomplish this via
</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmqctl add_user.....?
</I>
You absolutely could do that.   Details depend on how you're distributing Rabbit and how you're doing the per-user customization.  You could imagine giving your customers a run-once, initial provisioning scripts that creates users/passwords that your system needs for example.

Best regards,
Jerry
