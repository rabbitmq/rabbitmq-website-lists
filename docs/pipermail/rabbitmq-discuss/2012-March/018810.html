For the record, symmetric federation should work fine, it's just 
inefficient with bandwidth (this will change).

Does anything interesting appear in the logs when you try to restart and 
it hangs? Or at any other time?

Earlier in the thread we saw ehostunreach errors on running connections 
- i.e. a host we had a working TCP connection to stopped being routable. 
I'm not even sure how that would happen - is there anything unusual in 
your network that would explain it?

Also, do you have heartbeats turned on?

Cheers, Simon
