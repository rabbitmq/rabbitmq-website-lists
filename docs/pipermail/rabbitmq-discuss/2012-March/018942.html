<PRE>Hi,

I have noticed that intermittently there is a problem with using the management plugin from Firefox (haven't reproduced on other browsers yet). After visiting the Exchanges page a few times it no longer displays, but reports as error:

ReferenceError: fmt_exchange_type is not defined

Thought I would report it.

Thanks,

Dan.
