That looks like Rabbit is not even trying to listen for SSL. Do you see 
something like

=INFO REPORT==== 13-Mar-2012::11:49:04 ===
started TCP Listener on [::]:5672

=INFO REPORT==== 13-Mar-2012::11:49:04 ===
started SSL Listener on [::]:5671

in the logs? Or is there an error? What does your config file look like?

&gt;<i> I noticed that ServerA doesn't have ssl in the &quot;running_application&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> list. Is this why SSL doesn't work? I'm pretty sure erlang R13B03 thats
</I>&gt;<i> currently running on ServerA supports SSL because rabbit 1.8.0 is using it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are my options here? Would updating Erlang on ServerA to the latest

</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmq 1.8.0? If I were to still use Erlang R13B03, what shall I do to
</I>&gt;<i> make 2.7.1 work with SSL?
</I>
The SSL dependencies haven't changed much since 1.8.0. SSL support in 
newer Erlang is more robust, but if it was working for you with R13B03 
and 1.8.0 then it should work with R13B03 and 2.7.1.

I'm not sure, but I suspect Erlang R15B will not work with 1.8.0. 
Various bits of deprecated API have been removed, and I imagine 1.8.0 
used them.

Cheers, Simon
