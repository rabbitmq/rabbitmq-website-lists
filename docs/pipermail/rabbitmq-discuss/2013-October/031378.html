<PRE>Hi all,



Just upgraded our Dev instance to 3.2.0, and shortly after we started it appears node 1 came crashing down after running fine for a few hours, and is not allowing for a reboot.  The startup_err and erl_crash.dump both say the same thing:



Slogan: init terminating in do_boot ()



Our version is Erlang R14B04, and the other two nodes continue to run fine.  I saw some people had a permissions issue with that, but after rerunning the chown commands to give rabbitmq ownership of /var/lib/rabbitmq and its contents we continue to see issues.  In the <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbitmq at node1.log</A>&lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbitmq at node1.log</A>&gt;, I see this error:



=INFO REPORT==== 26-Oct-2013::15:36:36 ===
Error description:
   {error,{could_not_write_file,&quot;/var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia/<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at node1</A>/cluster_nodes.config&quot;,
                                enospc}}

Any ideas what else I could be looking at?



Thanks,

Kale
