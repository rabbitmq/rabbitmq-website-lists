<PRE>Hrmm, looking at the API's now,

   - incoming:
   [
      -
      {
         - stats:
         {
            - publish: 44,
            - publish_details:
            {
               - rate: 0.4
               }
            },
         - exchange:
         {
            - name: &quot;phi&quot;,
            - vhost: &quot;phi&quot;
            }
         }
      ],

Is the publish details time delayed?  e.g. for the last &quot;5 minutes&quot; or how
is that reset?  I don't see a &quot;published since&quot; kinda of field that would
let me calculate a rate of incoming message flow.  I can image that's a
&quot;transactions per minute&quot; kinda rate, but that'll never hit 0 if the queue
received one message since the beginning of time and nothing since.

Now I did see this:

   - backing_queue_status:
   {
      - q1: 0,
      - q2: 0,
      - delta:
      [
         - &quot;delta&quot;,
         - 0,
         - 0,
         - 0
         ],
      - q3: 0,
      - q4: 0,
      - len: 0,
      - pending_acks: 0,
      - target_ram_count: &quot;infinity&quot;,
      - ram_msg_count: 0,
      - ram_ack_count: 0,
      - next_seq_id: 71,
      - persistent_count: 0,
      - avg_ingress_rate: 0,
      - avg_egress_rate: 0,
      - avg_ack_ingress_rate: 0,
      - avg_ack_egress_rate: 0,
      - mirror_seen: 0,
      - mirror_senders: 1
      },


Is the next_seq_id used perhaps?  I COULD store the previous value and if
the value hasn't changed in 5 minutes on the monitoring side, alert on
that, assuming that that changes based upon each message received?

SO also going to release this:
<A HREF="https://github.com/jasonmcintosh/rabbitmq-zabbix">https://github.com/jasonmcintosh/rabbitmq-zabbix</A>

This is built off of some of the other monitoring stuff I've been working
on, but focused on zabbix.  The code gives an example template that (to me)
is a pretty solid set of monitoring items for each server, auto-discovery,
and basic stuff to monitor rabbitmq using zabbix.  Eventually, I'd like to
do a more push vs. pull type system, using zabbix_sender and a background
process that regularly polls the API (perhaps even a plugin if I can learn
enough erlang) and submits data to zabbix, instead of zabbix polling the
server.
