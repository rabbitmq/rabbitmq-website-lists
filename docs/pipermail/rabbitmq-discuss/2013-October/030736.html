<PRE>Only 1 consumer can consume a message from a Queue right ... With multiple clients we are expecting multiple consumers .. and we need to have the same message consumed by all the consumers ..
I have seen the tutorial from that it looks like each consumer needs to have a separate queue and so a copy of a message will be forwarded ...

In case we are mirroring queues..Why do we want to mirror all the queues since they have exactly same messages ...

&gt;<i> One basic question I have is ..we have lot of topics .... during configuration I noticed that we can select exchange as TOPIC .. does that mean it is a Topic and is eligible for mirroring ... In some of the previous posts you mentioned that exchange is kind of a routing table ..so bit confused with that ..
</I>
Topic is an exchange type. Queues can be mirrored, exchanges are *always* mirrored between
all nodes in a cluster.

&gt;<i> We have  multiple clients and will be subscribing to a topic ... not sure how we ne to configure so that these topics are mirrored
</I>
They should consume from queues that will have messages with specific routing keys
be routed to them.

See <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html</A> if it is still not clear. Message
distribution happens in routing time. Mirroring after messages reach a queue.
