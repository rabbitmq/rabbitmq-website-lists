There is a known bug in HA which will be fixed in the next release which can cause behaviour like this (queue unresponsive in management and invisible in rabbitmqctl). It is triggered when you have a mirrored queue, and the master dies, and then the slave which would have been promoted to master dies before promotion can complete.

Does that sound like the sort of thing that could have happened? One way to make that happen without killing nodes on a precise timer is to switch from one ha-mode=nodes policy to another with minimal overlap.

I'm afraid the only work around at the moment is to stop the whole cluster and start it again. And the node which management claims has the master for this broken queue will hang at shutdown and need to be killed :-(

Cheers, Simon
