<PRE>Hey all,

One of my Devs was trying to delete a queue through the management plugin which got created on the wrong node, and asked me to help out.  I went in and tried via the plugin, and it just hung, so I went command-line on it and ran rabbitmqctl list_queues -p vhost.  When I do that, that queue doesn't appear in the list.  Any ideas what might be going on, and how I might be able to reconcile the two?  We're running RabbitMQ 3.1.5 on SUSE 12.04.

Thanks!

Kale
