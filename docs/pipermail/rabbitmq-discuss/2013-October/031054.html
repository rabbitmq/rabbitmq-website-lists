<PRE>They hadn't had their heartbeats set correctly.  We've updated the broker to push a heartbeat every four minutes from our end of the connection.  Thanks for your help!

In what way exactly does it fail? What do the broker logfiles say?

What happens if you shut down all but one of the broker nodes?

That's hard to guess without knowing the logic of the client or it's network input.

It should be possible to provide better feedback if you can supply the output of connecting the client via the tracer:
