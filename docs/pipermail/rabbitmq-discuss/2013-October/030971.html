&gt;<i> 1. Is it necessary to declare the exchange prior to create the queue? (my queues have to communicate in one to one manner no need to have functionality like fanout and topic exchange.)
</I>
No but you need to have both (and a binding) in place before you publish messages for them
to be routed.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Is there any drawback of using default exchange functionality wise(queue is auto delete)?
</I>
Default exchange is for publishing &quot;directly to a queue&quot;. This is orthogonal with auto-deletion.
There are no real drawbacks except that the publisher needs to know the exact queue name.

&gt;<i> 3. Is there any way in rabbitmq-c-master from which I can catch the instance(like error checking method) where exactly my queue is gone died?
</I>
It's not exposed to clients.

There are 4 reasons:

 * Queue is deleted using queue.delete
 * Queue was declared as exclusive and the connection that declared it is gone.
 * Queue was declared as auto-delete and the last consumer that was using it is gone or cancelled.
 * Queue had TTL set on it and it has expired.
