Use publisher confirms.

There are many reasons why publishing may fail. Publisher confirms cover most of them
and Channel#waitForConfirms returns a boolean to indicate success or failure for the messages
that were not confirmed by the time it was invoked.

As it was mentioned earlier, basic.return listeners is how you detect unroutable messages.

The only other &#8220;input&#8221; that can be invalid is exchange name. It will result in a channel exception.
In practice, those are very rare and indicate a misconfiguration. You can check if the exchange
you need exist on application start by using exchangeDeclare with passive set to true.
