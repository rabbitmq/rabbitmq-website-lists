<PRE>Thanks Michael ..
When you say NO changes in framework ...I am little confused..

 Let's say a new consumer is introduced  .. 

1)The consumer can simply subscribe BUT there is NO way the dynamic queue is mirrored and also if the consumer has a downtime then the messages published during the downtime will be lost as the dynamic queue will be deleted .. Even if there is a feature where the dynamic queue is not deleted when the connection fails .. Can we mirror that queue and also how can we make sure when the client reconnects will it be using the same queue or will create a NEW queue...

2)If we need to mirror the queue the new consumer is going to consume from then we might have to do some confutation changes ..right??

&quot; Note that I was explaining things in AMQP 0-9-1 terms, and now you've revealed that your
requirements are framed in JMS terms, which are not exactly the same.&quot; ..
Can we use Rabbit to achieve the JMS based requirements ??

Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with how vFabric Rabbit's JMS client maps RabbitMQ protocol
to JMS.

Perhaps one of my colleagues has an answer for this?
