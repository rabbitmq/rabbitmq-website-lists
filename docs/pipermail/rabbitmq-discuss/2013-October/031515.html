<PRE>Yes, we had cleared the disk issue - the issue appears to be with one of our older tools (designed on 3.1.2) for creating vHosts, Exchanges and Queues automagically - something in the tool goes funky when anything new is created on the 3.2 cluster, or rather, created and then deleted.  Anything it created prior to 3.2 is fine.  We're investigating... thanks for your help!

Thanks,
Kale

Unfortunately the crash dump you supplied is of limited use. The first place to look is the broker logfile (including the sasl log). Was anything logged on any of the cluster nodes at the time of the problem?
I assume you have resolved the disk space issue.
