<PRE>Justin,

On face value I don't see any problem with this approach, but I
haven't had the time to look at your code in too much detail yet, so
this is just a preliminary response.

&gt;<i> I wanted each handler to be able to be restarted and never
</I>&gt;<i> miss a message, and I wanted a decoupling between the process emitting
</I>&gt;<i> the events and each handler.  I think durable queues and fanout
</I>&gt;<i> exchanges are the proper solution for this, but I may be wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My second question involves a timeout for the acknowledgment of
</I>&gt;<i> messages.  I noticed that if a process crashed, a message would
</I>&gt;<i> automatically be put back into the queue, but if instead the process
</I>&gt;<i> went into an infinite loop, the message would stay checked out
</I>&gt;<i> indefinitely.  Is there a way to tell the server that if a message has
</I>&gt;<i> been received, but not acked in a period of time, that it should be put
</I>&gt;<i> back into the queue?
</I>
This is handled by volume and not by time. After a certain amount of
unroutable messages have queued up (because their consumption is not
ack'ed) they will be returned to the sender.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know there is also one potential issue where it may be difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> manage the different exchanges and queues on the server. It would be
</I>&gt;<i> nice to be able to specify that a queue is durable, but if messages are
</I>&gt;<i> not consumed for a long period of time then it should be deleted.
</I>
This issue touches on the message expiration property in the message
header, which unfortunately is not clearly defined and hence is not
yet implemented in Rabbit.

HTH,

Ben
