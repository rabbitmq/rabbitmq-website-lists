Hey Gordon,

Yeah this is the same problem with cancelling the consumer. You have to ack
what you're working on first which is a bit dangerous.

&gt;<i> So for this to be of any use you would have to finish processing your
</I>&gt;<i> current task, ack that then requeue everything everything else. That may
</I>&gt;<i> be less attractive an option if it happens often as it removes the value
</I>&gt;<i> of the prefetch.
</I>
It also means the grid could be idle while I'm doing that. For example if
I'm working on a 10 minute task with other tasks in the local queue behind
it and there are idle consumers on the grid.

It's a tough problem but once it's solved it'll be great. We've looked at
lots of other grid solutions and none of them can do this. RabbitMQ is the
closest we've gotten.

Dave
