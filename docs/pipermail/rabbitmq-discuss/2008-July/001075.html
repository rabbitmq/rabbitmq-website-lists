<PRE>Joern,

Yes, you can always send examples and documentation via the list.

With regard to public documentation, we are currently going through
the process of changing our website to have a community authored
section in some kind of wiki-esque fashion, but we haven't made a
decision about which way to go yet. As with the much needed discussion
thread about management that Edwin started, we need a place for the
community to author content in a simple and cohesive fashion.

On that note, does anybody in the community have any ideas about how
they would like to see this happen? Any particular tools?

&gt;<i> There

</I>&gt;<i> Templates which still elude me.
</I>
Are you asking about what kind of typical patterns one would like to
have from a high level client's perspective?

BTW, do you have any source that we can look at?

Thx,

Ben
