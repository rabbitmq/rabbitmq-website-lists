Hey Tony,

A further update on this. It's been a week since I fixed the queue leak we
were having and the amount of memory RabbitMQ uses has slowly grown since
then. It's currently using about 1GB. The queue count is 20 and they are
all empty legit queues.

This may be nothing to worry about. I'm not sure how Erlang's garbage
collection works but if it's anything like Java's it won't start giving
back memory until it really has to. Do you know if it is possible to force
a garbage collection? Or maybe something else I should try to see what the
problem is?

One thing I'm slightly wary of is that the memory spiked when I connected
250 clients to it. And when I disconnected them it didn't shrink very much.

I'll keep an eye on it.

Dave
