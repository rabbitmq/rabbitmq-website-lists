Why use one job queue?  If you have multiple queues and use routing
keys as tags (&quot;big&quot;, &quot;small&quot;, &quot;100Kb&quot;, ..) then you can constrain the
system to be fair without depending entirely on the broker.

None of which is to invalidate your proposal below of course :-)

&gt;<i> The round-robin nature of message deliveries is great for load balancing if

</I>&gt;<i> can range anywhere from a few seconds to a minute worth of processing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did up an artificial test where 3 consumers were using basic.consume on a
</I>&gt;<i> single queue. Two consumers processed their jobs immediately, however the
</I>&gt;<i> final consumer slept for 30 seconds to simulate getting a &quot;big job&quot; before
</I>&gt;<i> ack'ing the message and consuming the next one. The result (which I believe
</I>&gt;<i> is due to the round-robin nature specified by AMQP) was two consumers
</I>&gt;<i> pumping through their jobs and sitting idle, even though there were plenty
</I>&gt;<i> of jobs remaining on the queue and the third consumer left busy &quot;processing&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> all the &quot;big jobs&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> This was done using Barry Pederson's amqplib-0.3 library in Python.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know erlang well enough to check the source but I assume RabbitMQ
</I>&gt;<i> does something like assigning jobs as they come in to each consumer on an
</I>&gt;<i> amqp queue? If this is the case, I think the desired behaviour would be
</I>&gt;<i> rather than assigning the jobs to a particular consumer immediately, assign
</I>&gt;<i> the job to the consumer when it sends an ack for the last message it
</I>&gt;<i> received to signify that it is ready to process a new job. This would work
</I>&gt;<i> too in the multi-threaded scenario where people wanted to ack the message
</I>&gt;<i> immediately before processing it so one thread can process the message
</I>&gt;<i> contents whilst the other downloads the next message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a work-around at the moment I am ack'ing a message after I receive it and
</I>&gt;<i> cancelling the consume before processing the job so other jobs will be
</I>&gt;<i> delivered to other consumers however, this means if the job fails for
</I>&gt;<i> whatever reason it will not be delivered to another consumer for processing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy to put the test code up if anyone is interested in trying this for
</I>&gt;<i> themselves.
