It was just an early prototype that hasn't gone very far, mainly for
lack of interest.

The idea was to expose a proprietary Rabbit API via AMQP using a
language neutral serialization protocol to marshall the API calls
(e.g. JSON, Hessian) in the absence of a formal management aspect to
the core protocol.

So you could expose this API in whatever language you wanted to and
then just use AMQP as a transport mechanism.

On the broker side, you have an AMQP/RPC server that unmarshalls the
commands and invokes the native function within the address space of
the broker.

One of the underlying principles of this was to have a strongly typed
contract on the client side, which may or may not be a good thing,
depending on how you look at it.

That's about as far as the idea got I'm afraid.

Having said that, Tony may be able to comment on a different approach
that involves using a DSL over XMPP to achieve the same thing which is
naturally a lot more flexible.

&gt;<i> I ask because after visiting
</I>&gt;<i> Alexis &amp; LShift in April, I have been following the AMQP management &quot;working
</I>&gt;<i> group&quot; and thinking about possible way of enabling/exposing various aspects

</I>&gt;<i> ideas please let me know.
</I>

Yes, there is a lot of value in driving a discussion about this topic
and forming some kind of concrete proposal based on use cases. Ideally
the community should define the requirements of the system :-)


HTH,

Ben
