<PRE>Hi,

We are experiencing a frequent partitioning problem on our network with our RabbitMQ cluster.  We've not been able to iron it out and are running out of time before this needs to move into production.

I'll just focus on our DEV environment as it is just a scaled down version of the other environments.

Running on ESXi virtual machines (4GB Ram, 4 Cores dedicated)
Windows2008 R2 SP1 64-Bit
RabbitMQ 3.2.0
Erlang R16B02

There are two web servers and one app server in the above config.   These are all connected to the same network.  Each servers is running its own node - clustering is done through the rabbit config file.

Devweb01 - Ram
Devweb02 - Ram
DevApp01 - Disk

The problem is that every once in a while it starts partitioning off nodes, with nothing really correlating with it happening... not big traffic on the network, no disruptions we can find, etc.  We have gone through and made sure there were no VM settings that allowed items to &quot;go to sleep&quot; or anything aside from a &quot;high performance setting&quot;  (versus power savings).

Here is what we are seeing in the logs... which to me looks like a network interruption, but nothing else indicated that the machine was having issues.  We have a load balancer that flags systems with problems, we have a zenoss node monitoring the servers, we checked the ESXi charts and logs, we looked through windows system logs... nothing seems to have been amiss.

In one partitioning event we saw this in the WebApp server log:

=INFO REPORT==== 27-Nov-2013::18:11:07 ===
rabbit on node '<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at NURWEB-DEVWEB01</A>' down

=ERROR REPORT==== 27-Nov-2013::18:11:10 ===
Mnesia('<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at NURWEB-DEVAPP01</A>'): ** ERROR ** mnesia_event got {inconsistent_database, running_partitioned_network, '<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at NURWEB-DEVWEB01</A>'}


And in the DevWeb01 machine mentioned's logs we saw this - it also mentions it lost connections to both of the other boxes.

=INFO REPORT==== 27-Nov-2013::18:10:53 ===
rabbit on node '<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at NURWEB-DEVAPP01</A>' down

=INFO REPORT==== 27-Nov-2013::18:11:00 ===
only running disc node went down

=INFO REPORT==== 27-Nov-2013::18:11:01 ===
rabbit on node '<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at NURWEB-DEVWEB02</A>' down

=INFO REPORT==== 27-Nov-2013::18:11:04 ===
only running disc node went down


And web02 only mentions the web01 going down

=INFO REPORT==== 27-Nov-2013::18:11:09 ===
rabbit on node '<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at NURWEB-DEVWEB01</A>' down

=ERROR REPORT==== 27-Nov-2013::18:11:11 ===
Mnesia('<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at NURWEB-DEVWEB02</A>'): ** ERROR ** mnes

None of the rabbit installs are actually down during this...

We've seen the same thing on our qa and production boxes - which are the same configurations, just with more nodes.  Not many though 8 nodes on production.

Any ideas would be really appreciated!  I've recently added a net_ticktime to my dev servers to set that at 120 (double I believe) to see if that helps.
