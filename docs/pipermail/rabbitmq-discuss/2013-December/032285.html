<PRE>We have been using RabbitMQ for a couple of years at this point, but only recently started looking into the RabbitMQ Admin monitoring. We've looked at the queues to see when something has died completely and there are several thousand messages stuck in queue, but the actual throughput of a Queue we weren't looking at previously.

In one of our recent integration tests, we are sending through a large number of messages ( 100's to 1000's ) per minute, and with 20 consumers, all of the data is being properly routed and processed. However, the monitor for the queue is showing 0 messages Queued ( Which is not surprising, as they are taken off immediately? ) but also the transfer rates, and messages per second are also all showing 0.

We can see the consumers active on the queue, and it is the only queue that we are using for that test.

For reference we're using the latest version of RabbitMQ 3.2.1, with the rabbitMQ Client jar for Java.

Thank you for your time,
-Christopher Lefevre
