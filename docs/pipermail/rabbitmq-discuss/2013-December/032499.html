I think that text is trying to say that if the node fails while the 
consumer is connected to a different node then the consumer will be 
cancelled.

&gt;<i> I am seeing behavior where a node fails, I immediately connect to an

Yes, it's likely to be possible that if you reconnect fast enough the 
queue metadata has not yet been updated, so you consume from the old 
master and immediately get a cancel notification. But you'd just want to 
handle that the same way as any other cancellation - presumably by 
reissuing basic.consume. You need to handle that anyway, so this is a 
bit counterintuitive but I wouldn't call it a bug.

Cheers, Simon
