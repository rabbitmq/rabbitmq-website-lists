<PRE>I have a question concerning consumer cancel notification when a consumer
is conusming from a queue when the cluster node that it is connected to
fails. In the docs (<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-cancel.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-cancel.html</A>) it states:

&quot;Other events, such as the queue being deleted, or in a clustered scenario,
the node on which the queue is located failing, will cause the consumption
to be cancelled, but the client channel will not be informed, which is
frequently unhelpful.&quot;

Surely if the node fails, the connection and channel will be disconnected,
so the consumer would not be able to receive a consumer cancel notification?

I am seeing behavior where a node fails, I immediately connect to an
alternative node, start a new consumer on the HA-queue, which then
immediately receives a consumer cancel notification. This only seems to
happen intermittently, which is doubly confusing.

Thanks
Mike
