<PRE>If you want to remove a node from a cluster, why not use the forget_cluster_node command, as described in <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html?">http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html?</A> See the section &quot;Breaking up a cluster&quot; for more details. Does that look like what you need?

Cheers,
Tim

&gt;<i> hello,

</I>&gt;<i> so the problem is like this -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> from another thread - start / stop order matters if you get all nodes down and don't start with the last one closed or just won't start in the 30 seconds interval all of them.. then it won't work, we all agree on that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ok , my question is : is there any way i can tweak (files i can edit) a r.m.q. node, so if i have this scenario-&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> node A , B, C -&gt; i bring down A nice ( or just kill the node but wait for the others to get an update that the A node is down) , then same for B, and last C 
</I>&gt;<i> now i don't want to start node C first , nor i want to start all of them at once;
</I>&gt;<i> what i want to know is : is there any way if i start node A first to make it just start and not try to connect to node B &amp; C? it's ok if i lose my queues...
</I>&gt;<i> tried editing my nodes_at_shutdown file not really working, anyone got any other suggestions?
