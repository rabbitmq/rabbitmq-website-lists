Hi Simon,

The issue is not that RabbitMQ does not detect a node down in a timely 
fashion, it does what I expect. The behavior in question is what happens 
after RabbitMQ removes the node due to net_ticktime expiration. If I set 
net_ticktime to 20 seconds, 20 seconds goes by, Node B is removed, and then 
the slow message delivery occurs. Likewise, set it to 10 mins, after 10 
mins, Node B is removed and the slowness occurs. Five to ten minutes after 
Node B is removed, the server catches up. So we are seeing degraded 
performance *after* Node B is removed from the cluster for up to 10 minutes. 
So much so, that even with a light load of 1MSG/sec after about 5 minutes 
the consumer falls behind by over 100MSGs. net_ticktime only effects when we 
will see the server become degraded, but not how long.

Thanks,
James
