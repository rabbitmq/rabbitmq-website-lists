<PRE>Well, there is in general a tendency towards increased stability in the 
HA code :-) I would say that most of the bugs that we are fixing these 
days are reasonably hard to hit. But there are regressions occasionally 
and there was a fairly severe one in 3.2.0, so that could have been the 
source of your problems.

Of course there is also the issue of clustering and network partitions; 
you will definitely experience more problems with clustering if 
deploying it across an unreliable network.

Cheers, Simon
