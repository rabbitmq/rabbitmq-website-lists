<PRE>Hi Simon,

That was an interesting thought I had not considered, but I do not think that is the case.  They are all part of the same domain and from what I gather all the servers sync up to a domain controller and the domain controllers nominate one amongst themselves.  Also, the time seems close enough within a tick that they notice each other being gone...  I'm sending off to one of my sever guys to see if there is any chance of the VM playing catchup or something suddenly with the time anyway, checking the logs and stuff for adjustments.

For the second disk node, I hear you.  In production there are multiple everything's including app-servers which is what will be running the disk nodes.   We are also going to set up the mirroring but until the underlying infrastructure is solid I don't want to add complexity

I am going to update our other platforms with the new net-tick settings and see if any of them fail.






Regards,

Bill Chmura

Hi.

Could the clocks be jumping? If the clock jumped forward by a minute or so then the Erlang VM could maybe determine that there hasn't been any response from another node for a minute, which would be enough to trigger the node down condition.

Is there anything else in the logs for the time period just before the node down message?

As an aside, you might not want to have a single disk node in a cluster, that's a single point of failure.

Cheers, Simon
