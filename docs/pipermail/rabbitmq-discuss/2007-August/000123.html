<PRE>[probably I was to confident in Nabble (<A HREF="http://www.nabble.com/">http://www.nabble.com/</A> 
RabbitMQ-f25704.html#) to use it to post to this list - seems the  
message never got through. So I repost it - please excuse if this  
becomes a dupe -md]

 &gt;
 &gt; In what way is QPid's python lib meant to break things?
I assume in as many ways as the authors come up with. Isn't that the  
purpose of compliance suites? Try all the corner cases until you a)  
break something or b) are satisfied that the test subject is fully  
compliant. Compare that to a client coded with reliability in mind:  
such a client would be carefully crafted to avoid corner cases, be  
well documented and well tested.

Then again, perhaps we just have a different understanding of  
&quot;breaking things&quot;.

Speaking for Qpid here :-) it's certainly not meant to break things -  
although we do use the library to write our cross-platform system  
test cases.

I can't really speak to simplicity - the API is certainly closer to  
the AMQP spec than a high level JMS style API...  If anyone has  
suggestions for improvement then we would certainly welcome them over  
on the Qpid mailing list.
That said, I now understand that <A HREF="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/</A> 
incubator/qpid/trunk/qpid/python/qpid is not only meant to be a  
testing vehicle but also a stand alone AMQP client library. It also  
seems so far to be the only AMQP implementation in Python so it is  
way to go for me.
