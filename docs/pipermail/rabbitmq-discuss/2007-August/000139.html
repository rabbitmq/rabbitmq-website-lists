<PRE>Yes, I'm currently running the M1 release.
Rabbit-sasl.log is empty and I also couldn't find stdout that you
mentioned.

Thanks,
Tanmay

Tanmay,

&gt;<i> when I try to run a RabbitMQ client (attached,

You are probably right and this method is indeed unimplemented in Qpid. 
It certainly wasn't when we ran the tests ~6 months ago, as noted in
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/interoperability.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/interoperability.html</A>

You can probably just skip that request and use a ticket number of 0, 
with RabbitMQ's lax_mode enabled (which it is by default - see above
page).

&gt;<i> *Also, there is no &quot;client-name&quot; passed as a parameter at the time of

I have no idea what the &quot;client-name&quot; value is for. Perhaps the QPid 
client passes that value as part of the peer properties exchanged during

connection negotiation, in which case it's informational only, i.e. it 
shouldn't affect the behaviour.

&gt;<i> *Alternatively, when I tried to run a Qpid client against a RabbitMQ 
</I>&gt;<i> broker (again, with the default settings, virtual hosts, etc). I got
</I>the 
&gt;<i> following error message at the first line of code: _connection = new 
</I>&gt;<i> AMQConnection(&quot;localhost&quot;, 5672, &quot;guest&quot;, &quot;guest&quot;, &quot;clientid&quot;,
</I>&quot;/data&quot;);*

What do the RabbitMQ server logs (stdout, rabbit.log, rabbit-sasl.log)
say?

What version of QPid are you running? The M1 release?

Regards,

Matthias.
