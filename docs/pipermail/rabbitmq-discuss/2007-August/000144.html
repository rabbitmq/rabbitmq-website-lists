<PRE>Hi Alexis, Matthias, 

Thanks for that information. I understand that 0-10 is not completely
finished. But, could you point me to the changes/proposal for reliable
messaging? Also, if there is a bullet list to the changes that have been
made/proposed for the 0-10 release, it'd be great if you could send it
to me or tell me where I can find that too. I would like to review the
scope of changes to reliable messaging, among other things like
transaction processing. For example, will the acknowledgement back to
the publisher feature provided for all types of messaging, like P2P,
Pub-sub, etc.

Thanks.

Regards,
Tanmay

Tanmay

The kind of reliability that you refer to will appear in AMQP 0-10.
We have been working on this or over six months, along with others
from the AMQP Working Group.  It's an important future enhancement to
AMQP, and to RabbitMQ, and one that we are all excited about.

Existing users will be able to continue using 0-8 and 0-9 (which is
almost the same as 0-8), but for those who need 'acks', that will
become a built-in feature of the spec, and of RabbitMQ.

The 0-10 draft is not strictly speaking for general consumption, as
you might expect with a work in progress.  But we welcome commentary
and it is an 'open' spec, so do please let me know if you would like
to get involved.

</I>&gt;<i> Are you guys working with the 0.9 version of the spec or do you have a
