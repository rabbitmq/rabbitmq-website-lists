<PRE>I have a couple of quick questions/suggestions about routing keys. I guess this is more AMQP-specific, but this list is as good as any to discuss ;-)

1. Why use &quot;.&quot; as the routing token separator? Can we make it configurable on the broker? Can we support sending a magic X-AMQP-ROUTING-SEPERATOR or something header with the message so it can be anything and vary by message?
	* It seems like an odd choice to use a character that will show up in data a lot
	* All publishers need to sanitize and all consumers need to translate back
		* Consumers could always use &quot;#&quot;, but then they could potentially match items they aren't expecting
		* If consumers use &quot;*&quot; and the data has a period, they may not match when they expect

Example:

I'm listening to commit messages from GitHub. My binding is github.push.*.mycoolproject, which means I want to listen to all push messages by anyone for a project named mycoolproject. If someone's github username has a period in it though, I won't see the messages (github.push.john.smith.mycoolproject). If I bound with github.push.#.mycoolproject I would see the previous message, but I might also get messages for other projects with GitHub users that have mycoolproject in their username (github.push.this.is.mycoolproject.user.project2). I know this isn't the best example, but I'm sick and my head is a bit murky ha.

2. Are there are future plans to publish a message with multiple routing keys?
	* I know I can publish the same message multiple times with different routing keys, seems inefficient
	* I may want to surface the message data in various useful ways into the routing key

Example:

For bugzilla messages, when someone changes a bug I send a bug.changed.[field] message. Many tools want to pivot on specific users though. It'd be nice to publish them also as <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">bzuser at example.com.changed.bug</A> so those tools don't have to listen to all changes and group by user themselves, which seems very inefficient.

If these should be taken up by the AMQP list/working group let me know and I'll try to bring them up in the correct place.

Thanks,
Christian
