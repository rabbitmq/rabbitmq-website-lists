ok. Did you have to set any env vars / modify the startup scripts in any 
way? And are you running rabbit as root, a dedicated 'rabbitmq' user, or 
yourself?

&gt;<i> I got &quot;rabbitmq-server start -detached&quot; from the documentation

</I>
There is no &quot;start&quot; in there. Shouldn't cause any harm though.

Is there an erl_crash.dump in the directory from which you started rabbit?

&gt;<i> I haven't found anything noteworthy in the system logs yet.
</I>
I see your rabbit is running the management plugin. Have you been 
keeping an eye on it through that? And did anything odd crop up - high 
memory or fd use, for example - just before the death?

It is quite rare for rabbit to die, and very unusual indeed for it to do 
so without a trace. For that to happen the most likely cause of death is 
that something/body is killing it.


Regards,

Matthias.
