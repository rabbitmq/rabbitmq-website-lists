<PRE>Hmmm, I hadn't really thought of that, I'll look into it. You mean adding something like &quot;secure.level.1&quot; to the routing key and only letting certain users bind with with that? Is there a way to restrict bindings based on routing keys? Also, wouldn't # and * bypass that?

Thanks,
Christian
