Cool.

&gt;<i> Here are some feature requests:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Queue Size (aggregate)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be helpful to display the current, aggregate queue size, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> the total sum of all queues. This can help an Admin detect when a queue
</I>&gt;<i> is not getting drained. This could be displayed as a single number on
</I>&gt;<i> the /api/overview within the Message Rates row.
</I>
Yeah, that sounds fairly useful.

&gt;<i> - RabbitMQ version
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can System Information display the RabbitMQ version? We added this into
</I>&gt;<i> Alice. It is very helpful when managing a cluster, because sometimes a
</I>&gt;<i> node fails to get upgraded. The version of Erlang can also be useful.
</I>
This is already there, albeit obscurely - open the applications pane on 
the overview page and you can see versions of all running applications.

&gt;<i> - Uptime
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also added to Alice. This is useful to track reliability.
</I>
Sounds useful.

&gt;<i> -rabbitmqadmin CLI
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We like it! However, it is missing the ability to display /api/overview.
</I>
That's a fair point, but the trouble is it's not very table-like 
(although it's becoming more so...)

&gt;<i> Also would still prefer a key-value pair option.
</I>
I think the KV part is not in doubt (as to general usefulness), it's the 
timestamp bit that feels very special-cased.

&gt;<i> -Firefox strangeness
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've noticed that I can only have one dashboard window open. We have
</I>&gt;<i> about 32 RabbitMQ nodes. Normally I would keep all 32 nodes open, each
</I>&gt;<i> in a separate tab window, in Firefox. But this seems to slow Firefox so
</I>&gt;<i> much that it becomes unusable. At a certain point Firefox needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> killed and after that because of some glitch it is impossible to login
</I>&gt;<i> back into RabbitMQ's dashboard.
</I>
Hmm. I'll investigate. Of course, JavaScript should never leak memory, 
but there are some bad GCs out there...

&gt;<i> Great job overall though. The ability to drill down into Channels and
</I>&gt;<i> see individual rates and counts is really nice.
</I>
You'll like the upcoming version then; that's extended so you can do the 
same for queues and exchanges, as well as seeing rates at which 
channels, exchanges and queues are talking to each other.

Cheers, Simon
