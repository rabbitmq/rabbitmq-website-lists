Not directly; it has the same problem. Of course, you could just spin up 
a short-lived thread to do the closing in either case.

Right. Of course, you could just reopen the channel that closed, but 
your approach may be simpler.

&gt;<i> So I guess the easiest way to go for me is: in the channel shutdown
</I>&gt;<i> listener, close the connection without trying to close channels, then
</I>&gt;<i> re-connect.
</I>
If you close the connection the channels get closed implicitly. But as 
noted above, you'll need to do that in a different thread.

Cheers, Simon
