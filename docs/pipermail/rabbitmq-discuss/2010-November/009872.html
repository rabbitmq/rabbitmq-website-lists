<PRE>Thanks for the quick reply.

Ok, cool.

&gt;<i> &gt; I have also tried some experiments where I use something like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consumerChannel.flow(false) to stop flow on the consumer's channel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, when I try to reopen the flow by doing

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; re-issue consumerChannel.basicConsume(...) after I re-enable flow from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the consumer side?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, you shouldn't do. The Java client has a test for channel.flow in

</I>
Ok.  I will take a look at the client source code and adjust my
experimental code accordingly.  Probably I'm making some incorrect
assumptions about the sequencing and sync/async nature of various
calls.

&gt;<i> FWIW, the idea of the broker sending channel.flow to the client is a
</I>&gt;<i> good one - it's sensible for the broker to be able to ignore just
</I>&gt;<i> publishes amongst other methods on each given channel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, channel.flow is synchronous, so the broker has to wait
</I>&gt;<i> for the client to respond (and send back the flow_ok) before it can
</I>&gt;<i> start getting upperty should the producer continue to send messages. The
</I>&gt;<i> problem here then is what timeout do you apply before you just start
</I>&gt;<i> ignoring the producer anyway? If the client is only doing publishes
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, you have absolutely no idea what the round trip time is.
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, as we discovered when we tried to implement it, there's the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility that the client _did_ respond and issue the flow_ok, but the
</I>&gt;<i> broker was so overloaded it didn't notice it until after the timeout.
</I>&gt;<i> Thus the client gets disconnected even when it did all the right things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, relying on TCP backpressure is pretty much the only
</I>&gt;<i> sensible thing that can be done.
</I>
Sounds like a case of &quot;fine in theory, but not so much in practice.&quot;
With such a fuzzy distinction between well-behaved and badly-behaved
clients, channel.flow starts to look pretty clunky.  From what I can
tell with the experimental code I've written, the TCP backpressure
works beautifully.

Thanks again for the info!
