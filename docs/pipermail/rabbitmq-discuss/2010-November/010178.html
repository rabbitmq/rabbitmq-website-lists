<PRE>Hi,

It is not necessary to upgrade the clients. The on-the-wire protocol has
not changed.

&gt;<i> Specifically:

</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> - what about the other way around (eg. client 2.2.0 with server 2.1.1)?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Since 2.2.0 comes with automatic server upgrades in non clustered mode

</I>
The change is that in the past, during upgrades of the server, messages
stored in the server would simply be moved to one side if the on-disk
schema changed. That is no longer the case - we have a framework in
place that can modify the on-disk data to update it as necessary to the
format required by newer versions.
