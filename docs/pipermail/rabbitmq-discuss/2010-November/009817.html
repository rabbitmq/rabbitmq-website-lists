You might also need to use basic.qos to prevent the broker flooding the
client with msgs. But in general, this behaviour is &quot;fine&quot;, provided
that's what you require in terms of behaviour of the consumers.

It's always worth looking at messages_ready (i.e. messages in the queue
which have not been delivered yet) and messages_unacknowledged (i.e.
messages which have been delivered by the queue for which no
acknowledgement has been received yet), to see quite what's going on.
(The &quot;messages&quot; field is the sum of those two).
