No - provided the queue is staying at a constant length, and the
consumers are acking messages (the &quot;messages unacknowledged&quot; field
should stay constant and low), the memory usage should not grow
continuously.

&gt;<i> One I can think of would be to maintain a rotation of queues... after

</I>&gt;<i> The consumer, finding no messages on a queue will move to the next

</I>
It's reasonable, but should be utterly unnecessary.
