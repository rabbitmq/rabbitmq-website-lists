The AMQP 0-9-1 spec requires that the broker raise a channel exception
if a publisher attempts to publish to a non-existent exchange.

It is unusual for publishers to deal with the risk of an exchange
disappearing, because exchanges are normally long-lived. Publishers must
be prepared to redeclare exchanges or recover from channel exceptions in
the presence of such risk.

If you explain the reason for consumers deleting exchanges then I may be
able to suggest an alternative messaging pattern.

As a preventative measure you can use permissions to prevent clients
from deleting exchanges, or use server-assigned names to make them
undiscoverable via AMQP.


Regards

Emile
