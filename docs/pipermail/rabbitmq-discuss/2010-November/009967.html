<PRE>I think this topic can quickly digress into a religious war of &quot;my API is better than your API&quot;. I don't want to send us down that road. ;)

Suffice it to say that I try and encourage people to ask the &quot;why am I doing it this way&quot; question as often as possible (because I ask myself that question on every project...can I do it better this time than I did last time, etc...). If it's because we don't have time or money to do any differently, that's a perfectly legitimate business decision. We do that here quite a bit, unfortunately. But if you're going down a different road altogether (AMQP), it often pays to get the larger perspective and, just because it *can* be done a certain way doesn't mean it *should*.

And don't get me started on ESBs! :) We're working on an ESB project right now and I'm amazed at how much stimulation of India's economy we're doing by paying these people to construct fantastically complicated systems of webservices and such to do simple things that can more efficiently and easily be done without the overhead imposed by the ESB paradigm. 

But that's another religious war I don't want to inflame! ;)

</I>&gt;<i> 3) Integration with standard software (e.g. ESBs) that already talk via JMS APIs
</I>&gt;<i> 4) People who actually like JMS but want the performance, standards

</I>&gt;<i> 5) People who want to outsource their broker to StormMQ and keep
</I>&gt;<i> existing JMS code.
