<PRE>Christian,

Both queue leases and per-queue message ttl give you that *except* the 
eviction criteria is time based rather than count based. A time based 
criteria seems preferable from the user's point of view, e.g. they know 
that if they connect at least every n seconds/days and drain their 
queues then they will not miss anything.

 From a server-admin's point of view a count-based eviction policy may 
seem preferable, but it really only manages resources in a sensible way 
if message sizes and the amount of sharing (i.e. the fact that the same 
message residing in multiple queues will be referred to *by reference* 
in both the memory and disk based storage) is predictable and constant. 
In many applications that is not the case.


Regards,

Matthias.
