Yes.

That's actually not correct. I upgraded the slave first, as I always do (it's our backup box...it gets updates first).

Bummer.

It's not a huge deal, as we just recreate things. But that causes us to not keep up-to-date on some brokers. I still have 1.8 brokers because I haven't wanted to take them down, upgrade them, then reconfigure everything I had (hoping I remember how I did it ;).
