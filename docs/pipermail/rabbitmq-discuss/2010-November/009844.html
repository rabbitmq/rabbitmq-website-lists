<PRE>Hi,
I'm using few exchanges on version 2.1.1 and sending/receiving messages 
without any porblem but when one of consumer delete exchange and another 
is trying to publish to deleted exchange he gets error: no exchange 
found which is expacted. My question is why the client is disconnected 
from the server?? Its recommended to always use:
channel.ExchangeDeclare before publish?

  It's behavior is strange for me because client when lose connection no 
longer subscribe exchanges.... but on server still are consumers and 
connections presented.

In code I need to reconnect client beacuese I always retrieve errore
  &quot;The AMQP operation was interrupted: AMQP close-reason, initiated by 
Peer, code=404, text=\&quot;NOT_FOUND - no exchange '333,333' in vhost '/'\&quot;, 
classId=60, methodId=40,
the same when I'm was trying to publish to not exist exchange.




Regards

Adam
