Shane,

You probably use `no_ack=True` flag for `basic.consume`.
With acknowledgments turned off (noack=True), all the messages
from the queue get delivered immediately to your consumer.

It doesn't really matter how fast is your consumer - Rabbit
believes that all the messages were delivered, while, in fact
they are buffered somewhere on the network.

Please try using explicit acknowledgments, with no_ack=False
and do acks manually using `basic_ack`

Cheers,
  Marek
