Remember that any modification of shared database must be agreed between

latency for commands like exchange.declare or queue.bind. We rarely
see a cluster of more than a few nodes.

They won't.

It would help to spread the connections equally between nodes.
That is pretty useful if you have a lot of connections.

For HA we're usually suggesting Active-Passive failover:

We're currently working on Active-Active HA, but it will take us some time.

Clustering does help in &quot;Load balancing&quot; but only in some situations.
For example it may be pretty useful for the 'fanout' cases, when you
have many queues.

But if you have a single queue, clustering won't help you.
It's a bit like with database sharding, if you have one monolitic table -
sharding won't help.

Cheers,
