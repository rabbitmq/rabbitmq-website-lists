Does this include the broker configuration? I just upgraded a Ubuntu box to 2.2.0 and the broker wouldn't start. Had to zap mnesia then it started fine. Had to re-create all users/vhosts/permissions (again), though. :/

Was there a script I needed to run or something? I kind of hoped that apt would take care of running that for me...
