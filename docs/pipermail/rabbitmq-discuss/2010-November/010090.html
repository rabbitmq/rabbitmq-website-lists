<PRE>Adam,

Although you've presented your suggestions more than
two monts ago, I'd like to share my thoughts now.

On Fri, Sep 17, 2010 at 22:55, Adam Nelson &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">adam at varud.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> I've been using RabbitMQ for 2 months now and I figured I would share my
</I>&gt;<i> experiences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> == Background ==
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using RabbitMQ because Celery recommends it. &#160;If Celery recommended
</I>&gt;<i> something else, I would have used that. &#160;I'm just pointing that out because
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes core services forget that people often use them because a
</I>&gt;<i> particular library favors that implementation. &#160;It's important to take care
</I>&gt;<i> of the downstream libraries, especially when you're using an open protocol
</I>&gt;<i> like AMQP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> == Comments so Far ==
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think RabbitMQ is awesome and has done really well so far for me. &#160;It's
</I>&gt;<i> been very fast (only marginally important for me) and very stable (much,
</I>&gt;<i> much more important for me). &#160;Here's my constructive criticism (i.e. things
</I>&gt;<i> that can be addressed easily IMHO).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* This newsgroup format is terrible. &#160;Please move to Google Groups.
</I>
There is a copy of our list on GG, but the full migration won't happen.
I'm fairly happy with mailman, although I do agree that there is
a place for improvement.

&gt;<i> &#160;* The code is very difficult to get at. &#160;Please move to Github (or
</I>&gt;<i> BitBucket). &#160;I see that you're using Mercurial already, so BitBucket is the
</I>&gt;<i> obvious choice. &#160;I think GitHub is way more feature rich but if you're not
</I>&gt;<i> willing to move to Git, that won't work of course.
</I>
The code is now mirrored on github.

&gt;<i> &#160;* The documentation is not version-specific. &#160;This has caused me enormous
</I>&gt;<i> problems (specifically with set-permissions, which is why I'm in the mode to
</I>&gt;<i> write this message at all). &#160;Please move to a platform that supports
</I>&gt;<i> versioned documentation better. &#160;I don't know the best solution to this
</I>&gt;<i> exactly - maybe Sphinx or just a wiki with a url structure that supports
</I>&gt;<i> multiple versions?
</I>
I do understand your point, but that's not something top-priority IMO.
We always strongly encourage to upgrade to the newest version,
and we want to focus on improving our latest version.

&gt;<i> &#160;* Where are the open tickets? &#160;It appears that all bugs are going through
</I>&gt;<i> the mailing list - it's really hard on the users to not have an
</I>&gt;<i> easy-to-search ticket system. &#160;Launchpad could work or BitBucket's issue
</I>&gt;<i> system, or Redmine, or Trac?
</I>
Yeah, I'd love to have open our bugtracker, but apparently, that's pretty hard.
We're still looking for a way how to do it.

&gt;<i> &#160;* The site itself needs a fresh look. &#160;I know MongoDB is funded, but
</I>&gt;<i> there's an example of a great site for this type of thing:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mongodb.org/">http://www.mongodb.org/</A> .
</I>
Would you like to volunteer? I'm much better at writing erlang
than doing websites.

&gt;<i> &#160;* Outdated stuff should be taken down or have a disclaimer on it. &#160;For
</I>&gt;<i> instance the ec2 page: <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/ec2.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/ec2.html</A> has images for
</I>&gt;<i> Karmic Koala. &#160;While that was great last year, it's really time to have a
</I>&gt;<i> Lucid ec2 images available - or nothing at all. &#160;A Lucid image, because it
</I>&gt;<i> is long term, could be up for a year or two and it would be ok.
</I>
Ec2 page has been fixed, I hope.

&gt;<i> &#160;* Please don't tell Mac users to use MacPorts:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/macports.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/macports.html</A> It's time to move them to HomeBrew at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew</A>
</I>
We're making some slow progress on that front.

&gt;<i> &#160;* Please be more descriptive about how to set up an environment with tools
</I>&gt;<i> like Alice and Wonderland. &#160;These appear to be great assets to RabbitMQ, but
</I>&gt;<i> are hidden in the dense 'Getting Started' page:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/how.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/how.html</A> . &#160;All the links from a Getting Started
</I>&gt;<i> page should take no longer than 1 hour to read. &#160;Check out Django's one hour
</I>&gt;<i> intro here: <A HREF="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/">http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/</A> &#160;. &#160;The
</I>&gt;<i> first link on RabbitMQ's Getting Started page goes to this Alexis Richardson
</I>&gt;<i> talk -
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/erlang/alexis-richardson-introduction-to-rabbitmq">http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/erlang/alexis-richardson-introduction-to-rabbitmq</A>
</I>&gt;<i> . &#160;While the content is great, it's geared towards the intermediate user,
</I>&gt;<i> not a beginner just getting started. &#160;Also, having dynamic delicious
</I>&gt;<i> searches is fine for an appendix maybe, but not the first page for people
</I>&gt;<i> getting started.
</I>
We've introduced tutorials, and we'll continue to improve. Feedback is welcome.

Cheers,
    Marek Majkowski
</PRE>
