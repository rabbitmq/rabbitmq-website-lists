<PRE>Hi,

This is what I tried
 * I start running rabbit with no NODENAME set and entered the following commands
  * rabbitmqctl stop
  * /etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server stop
  * epmd -kill ( Is this correct? I didn't see a restart in the documentation )
  * In /etc/hosts changed line from 127.0.1.1 &lt;oldhostname&gt; &lt;oldhostname&gt;.localdomain -&gt; 127.0.1.1 &lt;newhostname&gt; &lt;newhostname&gt;.localdomain
  * in /etc/sysconfig/network changed HOSTNAME=&lt;oldhostname&gt; -&gt; HOSTNAME=&lt;newhostname&gt;
  * /bin/hostname &lt;newhostname&gt;
 * /etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server start

The error I get is this:
Activating RabbitMQ plugins ...
3 plugins activated:
* amqp_client-2.8.6
* erlando-2.8.6
* rabbitmq_shovel-2.8.6

ERROR: epmd error for host &quot;&lt;oldhostname&gt;&quot;: nxdomain (non-existing domain)

Were you able to try this again (changing only the host name but not the node name) and did it work for you? If not I'd like to know so we can investigate.

Cheers

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We are currently running rabbitmq on a system where there is a need to change the hostname occasionally.  Right now, when the hostname is changed, we also update the NODENAME variable in the rabbitmq-env.conf file.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The problem we're having right now is that due to a bug when setting up the rabbitmq-env.conf file, sometimes the NODENAME variable exists but is not set to anything ( NODENAME=) so rabbit never successfully starts up.  Even after setting the NODENAME variable to the hostname, rabbit still doesn't start up properly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can you explain a bit more about this 'bug' please? What exactly is

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The only way that I could find to recover from this situation without killing the erlang process, was to also set a MNESIA_DIR variable. After I did that, once the NODENAME was set to the correct hostname, rabbit started up properly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now this makes no sense at all to me. If you are trying to recover
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'without killing the erlang process' then how are you planning on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changing the NODENAME? Once an erlang node has become part of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distributed system, you cannot arbitrarily change the node's name
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without restarting the net_kernel AFAIK so I can't see how this is even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible. Also, because you're stating that 'rabbit started up properly'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm assuming that you have in fact taken the node offline (using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> `rabbitmqctl stop` or one of the various service scripts that invokes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it) and that you are now starting the node again. The rabbit startup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts (and associated infrastructure) is not set up to handle changing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the name of a node post-installation in this manner, so I would not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expect this to work smoothly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> A couple of questions:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is this the proper way to fix the situation?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No. As I said a moment ago, rabbit is not set up for this kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scenario so I'd be very cautious about doing this and would really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recommend against it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Will this have unintended consequences?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have no idea, but it is entirely possible that various things could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> break in obscure and alarming ways. I really would not do this if I were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We are running rabbitmq-server-2.8.6 and erlang-R15B.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Liz. I would like to help you find a safe work-around so that you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use rabbit in your environment. I would really like to understand why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the changing of a machine's host-name is causing problems for you. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fully realise that after changing the hostname, it is possible that a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restart may be required (although I'd have to do some research to verify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether or not this is a hard requirement). But I cannot understand why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a change to the machine's host name requires changing the rabbit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NODENAME at all, unless you've altered the rabbit start scripts to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'longnames' configuration (i.e., including the complete host name in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> node name) in which case, a simple solution to your problem might be to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> switch back to using 'shortnames'. If erlang is started using -sname
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rabbit@`hostname -s` and your /etc/hosts configuration supports
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolving the machine's IP to the short version of the name, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changing the hostname shouldn't cause all of these headaches.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, if I launch rabbit with something like this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> env RABBITMQ_NODENAME=rabbit RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT=5672
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RABBITMQ_LOG_BASE=&quot;/tmp&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RABBITMQ_MNESIA_DIR=&quot;/tmp/rabbitmq-rabbit-mnesia&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RABBITMQ_PID_FILE=&quot;/tmp/rabbitmq-rabbit.pid&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_EXPAND_DIR=&quot;/tmp/rabbitmq-rabbit-plugins-scratch&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RABBITMQ_ENABLED_PLUGINS_FILE=&quot;/tmp/enabled-plugins&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RABBITMQ_CONFIG_FILE=&quot;/tmp/etc/rabbit&quot; ./scripts/rabbitmq-server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then change the hostname, then stop rabbit and start it again,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything is fine.
