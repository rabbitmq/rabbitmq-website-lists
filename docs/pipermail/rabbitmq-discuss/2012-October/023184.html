<PRE>Hi everyone! We've just put in place a nightly build system for the 
RabbitMQ server and clients. You can download nightlies from 
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/nightly-builds.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/nightly-builds.html</A>

We've also put documentation for what will be the next version of 
RabbitMQ at <A HREF="http://next.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html.">http://next.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html.</A>

We're evolving towards a model where we have feature releases every few 
months, with bugfix releases in between. It's possible there will be a 
2.8.8 bugfix release, but that's not what the current nightlies are - 
they represent what will be RabbitMQ 3.0.

So with some caveats in place:

  * Obviously we do not suggest running nightlies on production systems.

  * We don't always guarantee upgrades from one nightly to another will
    work - you may have to reset everything and start again sometimes.

  * You would also have to reset everything and start again to revert to
    a stable release from a nightly.

...I'd invite you to have a look at what's coming, and tell use what you 
think.

I'm going to write more on the subject as we get closer to the release, 
but some of the major new features include:

  * HA queues are configured dynamically by a new policy mechanism,
    rather than by declaring them with &quot;x-ha-policy&quot;. HA-ness
    can be changed at any time. HA queues are also much faster.

  * Federated exchanges are now normal exchanges, with federation
    similarly configured dynamically by policy. The &quot;x-federation&quot;
    exchange type is no more.

  * Clustering commands in rabbitmqctl have been rewritten to make
    clustering easier and more robust.

  * Web-STOMP and MQTT plugins are included.

  * Lots of other smaller new features and bug fixes.

The network protocol hasn't changed; you can run 2.x clients against 3.x 
server and vice versa.

So please try it out, and talk to us!

Cheers, Simon
