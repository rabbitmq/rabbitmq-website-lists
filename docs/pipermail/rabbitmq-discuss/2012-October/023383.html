Well, the send queue is limited in size. So the publisher should block 
fairly quickly.

Yes.

Well, the flow status *in the UI* is designed not to toggle at high 
speed, since that would not be very readable - it shows &quot;flow&quot; if the 
connection has been blocked in the last 5 seconds. This is driven by 
&quot;last_blocked_age&quot; and &quot;last_blocked_by&quot;.

The rabbitmqctl command results you posted show some connections which 
had blocked some time in the past, all more than 5 seconds ago. 
Unfortunately I forgot to ask you to add &quot;state&quot; to the list of columns, 
to determine if they were blocked now. If we see any connections that 
were blocked by flow control a long time ago, and are still blocked, 
then I'm concerned.

Cheers, Simon
