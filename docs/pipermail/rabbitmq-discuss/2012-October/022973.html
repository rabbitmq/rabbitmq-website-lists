<PRE>Hi Adam,

If you have multiple consumers per channel then long-running consumers
may hold up dispatch of callbacks to other consumers on that channel.
The Java API guide has more information:

<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html</A>

&gt;<i> instance, having a thread pool dedicated for such operations, utilizing

</I>
You may supply your own ExecutorService if you need to - see the API
guide again.

&gt;<i> Also, as a side note, has any consideration been given to using java's

</I>
I'm not sure how much more concurrency can be offered without violating
ordering constraints. Please feel free to suggest concrete improvements.
