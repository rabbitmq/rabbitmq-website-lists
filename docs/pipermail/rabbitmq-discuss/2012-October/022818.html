<PRE>Hi

Could someone please help me. I have a user who keeps getting the following error message...
'Server channel error: 403, message: ACCESS_REFUSED - access to queue 'amq.gen-gx1n4EQIgnm7NVZlwZI2e5' in vhost '/blah' refused for user 'username''
What's weird is that if I use the same client code and same user credentials (from a different location) I connect fine. They have assured me that port 5672 is open.
Does anyone have any suggestions or explanation for this behaviour.

Thanks

Jim
