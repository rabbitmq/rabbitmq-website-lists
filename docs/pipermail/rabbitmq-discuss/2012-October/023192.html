Ok no probs, I don't want you to think I'm telling you off! :D

&gt;<i> We just have found why we don't get messages anymore from the broker.
</I>&gt;<i> Your explanation corresponds exactly to our problem : when Hbase 
</I>&gt;<i> connection fails, it generates an exception, and in this case, we 
</I>&gt;<i> don't 'ack' nor 'nack/reject' the message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, we nack the message when something wrong occurs and so we get the 
</I>&gt;<i> next messages from the queue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Awesome - glad it works for you now.

Cheers,
Tim

</I>&gt;<i>         Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>         We have a rabbitMQ consumer that takes messages from a queue
</I>&gt;<i>         and write them in a HBase store.
</I>&gt;<i>         When HBase connection fails, the consumer get an exception and
</I>&gt;<i>         messages are not acknowledged, that's ok.
</I>&gt;<i>         After a few minutes, the consumer doesn't get messages
</I>&gt;<i>         anymore, even after restarting Hbase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Firstly, I don't really understand what you're describing here.
</I>&gt;<i>     What does the HBase connection failure have to do with the
</I>&gt;<i>     rabbitmq consumer? Are you saying that the HBase connection
</I>&gt;<i>     failure causes an unhandled exception on the thread which the
</I>&gt;<i>     consumer is running in? What does this have to do with acks - are
</I>&gt;<i>     you saying that your client code does not ack messages which
</I>&gt;<i>     arrive that cannot be written to HBase? That's fine, but you ought
</I>&gt;<i>     to nack/reject them unless you're hanging on to them deliberately
</I>&gt;<i>     in order to deal with them later on. Perhaps this is what is
</I>&gt;<i>     causing the problem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;If a consumer dies without sending an acknowledgement the AMQP
</I>&gt;<i>     broker will redeliver it to another consumer or, if none are
</I>&gt;<i>     available at the time, the broker will wait until at least one
</I>&gt;<i>     consumer is registered for the same queue before attempting
</I>&gt;<i>     redelivery.&quot; - <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So if you do not ack the messages you've already received *nor*
</I>&gt;<i>     nack/reject them, then you're not going to get any more messages
</I>&gt;<i>     until you do? Am I missing something here, or are you just not
</I>&gt;<i>     instructing the broker that you're ready to continue consuming
</I>&gt;<i>     from the queue (by dealing with the messages it has already sent
</I>&gt;<i>     you which need to be ack'ed or rejected)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         When debugging rabbitMQ client, we have noticed, that it is
</I>&gt;<i>         blocked on the following line: SocketInputStream:129 ( Java
</I>&gt;<i>         build 1.6.0_33-b03)
</I>&gt;<i>         The Frame class is waiting for messages, but the used socket
</I>&gt;<i>         doesn't receive any data anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>         We also notice, that there is no timeout on this socket.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     There isn't meant to be a timeout when reading frames.
</I>&gt;<i>
