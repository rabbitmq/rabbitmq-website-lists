<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for your response and sorry for using google groups.

We just have found why we don't get messages anymore from the broker.
Your explanation corresponds exactly to our problem : when Hbase connection
fails, it generates an exception, and in this case, we don't 'ack' nor
'nack/reject' the message.

Now, we nack the message when something wrong occurs and so we get the next
messages from the queue.

Thanks again,
Nicolas

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, I don't really understand what you're describing here. What does
</I>&gt;<i> the HBase connection failure have to do with the rabbitmq consumer? Are you
</I>&gt;<i> saying that the HBase connection failure causes an unhandled exception on
</I>&gt;<i> the thread which the consumer is running in? What does this have to do with
</I>&gt;<i> acks - are you saying that your client code does not ack messages which
</I>&gt;<i> arrive that cannot be written to HBase? That's fine, but you ought to
</I>&gt;<i> nack/reject them unless you're hanging on to them deliberately in order to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with them later on. Perhaps this is what is causing the problem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;If a consumer dies without sending an acknowledgement the AMQP broker
</I>&gt;<i> will redeliver it to another consumer or, if none are available at the
</I>&gt;<i> time, the broker will wait until at least one consumer is registered for
</I>&gt;<i> the same queue before attempting redelivery.&quot; - <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/**">http://www.rabbitmq.com/**</A>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you do not ack the messages you've already received *nor*
</I>&gt;<i> nack/reject them, then you're not going to get any more messages until you
</I>&gt;<i> do? Am I missing something here, or are you just not instructing the broker
</I>&gt;<i> that you're ready to continue consuming from the queue (by dealing with the
</I>&gt;<i> messages it has already sent you which need to be ack'ed or rejected)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  When debugging rabbitMQ client, we have noticed, that it is blocked on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the following line: SocketInputStream:129 ( Java build 1.6.0_33-b03)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Frame class is waiting for messages, but the used socket doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receive any data anymore.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We also notice, that there is no timeout on this socket.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There isn't meant to be a timeout when reading frames.
