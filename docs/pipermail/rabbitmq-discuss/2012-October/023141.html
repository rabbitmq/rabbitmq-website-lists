<PRE>Hello,

I am involved in a project that uses the .NET RabbitMQ client.

We have some clients that will be connecting to a broker over a high latency, high bandwidth link. To improve message throughput, we need to tweak some socket options, namely the send buffer size.
In addition, we would also like to reduce the socket timeout when connecting.

As far as I can see, the .NET client does not support setting any of these options easily through its API.

I have been able to achieve this by using some dirty workarounds like reflection or subclassing implementation classes, however, it would be ideal if this functionality could be added into the API (maybe the ConnectionFactory?).

I am also happy to make a few changes to the .NET client code, and submit these if it helps at all.

Kind Regards,

Tomasz Zuber
