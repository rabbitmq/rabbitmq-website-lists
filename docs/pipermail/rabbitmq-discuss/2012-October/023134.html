Have you read this:

<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html#behaviour">http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html#behaviour</A>

&quot;Clients that were consuming from the mirrored-queue and support our 
Consumer Cancellation Notifications extension will receive a 
notification that their subscription to the mirrored-queue has been 
abruptly cancelled. At this point they should re-consume from the queue, 
which will pick up the new master. The reason for sending this 
notification is that informing clients of the loss of the master is 
essential: otherwise the client may continue to issue acknowledgements 
for messages they were sent by the old, failed master, and not expect 
that they might be about to see the same messages again, this time sent 
by the new master. Of course, clients that were connected to the failed 
node will find their connections failed, and will need to reconnect to a 
surviving node of the cluster.&quot;

?

If the consumer is connected to a node other than the one that failed, 
it will not be disconnected, but it will be sent a cancellation 
notification and will have to reissue basic.consume.

Cheers, Simon
