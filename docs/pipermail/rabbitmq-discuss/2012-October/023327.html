<PRE>As part of our production monitoring support, we have a script that runs
every five seconds and checks some information about the queues. In
particular, it uses the &quot;/api/queues/...&quot; URL to  query info about them.

All of our queues are declared as HA. Recently we had some problems where a
node just got stuck for 30+ minutes (Known linux kernel bug). However, on
the monitoring running on the healthy node, I was seeing my /api/queues
queries timing out.

I'm guessing that there's some set of the HTTP APIs that when invoked, may
cause network traffic to other nodes. And if those nodes are down, the HTTP
API is essentially useless as it eventually times out waiting for
communication with the downed node.

Can you always helpful RabbitMQ folks tell me if this is indeed the case,
and if there's anything else useful to know when planning a monitoring
strategy using the HTTP API?

Thanks,

Matt
