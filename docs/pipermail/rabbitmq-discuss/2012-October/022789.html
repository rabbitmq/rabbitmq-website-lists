<PRE>Gavin,

I came to the same conclusion in haigha and removed support for it. I
figured that a disconnect callback gave the user all they needed to
make the appropriate decision on what to do.  Moving this burden to
the user greatly simplified the code and tests.

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to get 0.9.6 wrapped up and out the door (finally). If you're a
</I>&gt;<i> Python developer and use Pika, I wanted to solicit your feedback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I've been going through, adding tests and cleaning up the code, I've come
</I>&gt;<i> to the opinion that Reconnection Strategies, at least in their current form
</I>&gt;<i> are not very useful. There are a few reasons for this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) They do not restore state, meaning your application will still have to
</I>&gt;<i> know when you are disconnected and it will have to reestablish all of the
</I>&gt;<i> channels and if it's a consumer, re-issue any state based commands, such as
</I>&gt;<i> Basic.Consume, Confirm.Select etc. If the ReconnectionStrategy classes could
</I>&gt;<i> restore state, I'd see much more value in them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) As it is, the apps using the asynchronous adapters can listen for the
</I>&gt;<i> connection close event and handle this on their own. Again if anyone was
</I>&gt;<i> using the ReconnectionStrategy classes for re-establishing the connection,
</I>&gt;<i> they would have to do the rest of the work this way, anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) BlockingConnection, which seems to be the most popular adapter, can not
</I>&gt;<i> use them. Since it currently reimplements the connection closing to raise an
</I>&gt;<i> exception when the connection is remotely closed or dropped, it could not
</I>&gt;<i> expect the event to be fired. A design decision would have to be made to
</I>&gt;<i> force users of BlockingConnection to use an callback for handling
</I>&gt;<i> connections being closed in order to support reconnections strategies or
</I>&gt;<i> keep it the way it is, which is a more pythonic approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, I am leaning towards dropping them as part of the core
</I>&gt;<i> library. If I do this, I would include an example that re-implements the
</I>&gt;<i> SimpleReconnectionStrategy class as a demo consumer that shows how to create
</I>&gt;<i> a reconnectable consumer application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're a pika user, do you use the SRS or your own ReconnectionStrategy
</I>&gt;<i> extended class? Are you in favor of removing it or keeping it?  If I end up
</I>&gt;<i> going the route of removing it, it will mean I can get 0.9.6 out, possibly
</I>&gt;<i> this weekend. Keeping it may mean another week or two.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a side note, 0.9.6pre1 is in the master branch on github and could use
</I>&gt;<i> some testing outside of my environment. If you're interested and able, you
</I>&gt;<i> can install it via pip install -e
</I>&gt;<i> git+<A HREF="git://github.com/pika/pika.git#egg=pika-v0.9.6pre1">git://github.com/pika/pika.git#egg=pika-v0.9.6pre1</A>
