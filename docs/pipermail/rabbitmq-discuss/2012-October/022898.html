Right, so rabbit attempting to allocate 700Mb looks a bit suspicious but 
could still be ok, i.e. if it wasn't using much at the time.

Could a client might be sending a very large message?

</I>
You may want to set up some automated monitoring/logging, so when a 
problem does arise you can look at the most recent reports in the post 
mortem.

&gt;<i> The other thing I'm seeing is that shovel appears to be getting

</I>
Have you got heartbeats enabled? If not then turn them on.

Do the shovel connections show up at the destination?

Btw, have you got a prefetch_count set in your shovel config and are 
running in an ack mode other than no_ack? If not then that might explain 
the unexpectedly high memory usage since a stuck shovel connection would 
cause messages to pile up in memory in the shovel.

Regards,

Matthias.
