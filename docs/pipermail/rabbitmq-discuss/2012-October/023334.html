<PRE>Hi Matt.

In 2.8.x /api/nodes will make RPC calls to each node, but no other paths 
will. In 3.0 that's going to be removed as well.

However, /api/queues, like a lot of other paths, makes calls into Mnesia 
to figure out what things exist. When a node is unresponsive, calls into 
Mnesia can hang...

... but only for long enough for the VM to declare that the node is down 
(again configured by net_ticktime, defaulting to about a minute). After 
that, the node should be declared down and Mnesia should ignore it.

So when you say the node was &quot;stuck&quot;, was it completely unresponsive? I 
am wondering if it could be just responsive enough to prevent Erlang 
from considering it down, while still being unresponsive enough to... be 
unresponsive.

Cheers, Simon
