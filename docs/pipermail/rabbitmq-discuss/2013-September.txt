The node you are connecting to is not reachable from the client's machine
or you did not specify the host/port/vhost/credentials correctly.

Please check that port 5672 (or 5671, if you use TLS) is accessible. You can verify
it using telnet or similar. It very well may be a firewall configuration issue.

Hi Michael,

 The same program is working If server A is up and running.( Now i need to
check my cluster env working or not )

telnet is working ( between two hosts )

Perhaps I misunderstood your real expectation. Do you expect the client to connect to
B if A is down because it is cluster-aware?

There is a way to provide multiple addresses to ConnectionFactory [1]. Then the first
accessible address should be used *during initial connection*. Clients are not cluster
aware otherwise. It has been discussed whether they should be, so far there is no
clear answer.

Can you post a code snippet that demonstrates how you set up ConnectionFactory?

I'm not sure I understand what exactly your expectations are. If A is accessible
to the client does not mean that B is. Also, check RabbitMQ log on B, do you see
connections being logged there?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Lower delivery rate than publish rate - why?
Message-ID: <bc4520ba-17ce-4f87-a4cf-1c374c3ad6e0@googlegroups.com>

Hello everyone!

We've been experiencing some behavior that I don't understand, and none of 
my searching or documentation-reading has been fruitful, so I'm here to ask 
you all for expert knowledge.

Broadly, we're seeing a lower delivery rate than publish rate. I've 
attached an image to this message that shows how we're able to keep up when 
the publish rate is less than 600 messages/second, but above that, 
consumption falls behind publication. Around 16:00 on that chart, we 
doubled the number of consumers, and it made no difference that we could 
tell. The erratic behavior of the publish rate is us turning off publishes 
of the most active queue because we were falling far enough behind that we 
became worried. When the backlog would get low enough, we would turn it 
back on, and we did that a few times.

Here are some vitals to our cluster:

   - 2 nodes
   - Each node is a m1.xlarge instance hosted in EC2
   - We have 133 queues in the cluster (see note below)
   - All queues are mirrored (they all use a policy that makes them highly 
   available)
   - All queues are durable; we use AWS provisioned IOPS to guarantee 
   enough throughput
   - We only use the direct exchange

Regarding the number of queues, there are four kinds: the "main" queues, 
retry-a queues, retry-b queues, and poison queues. Messages that fail for 
whatever reason during consumption will get put into the retry queues, and 
if they fail long enough, they'll wind up in the poison queue where they 
will stay until we do something with them manually much later. The main 
queues then see the majority of activity.

The average message size is less than 1MB. At nearly one million messages, 
we were still under 1GB of memory usage, and our high watermark is 5.9GB. 

Disk IOPS don't appear to be the problem. Metrics indicated we still had 
plenty of headroom. Furthermore, if IOPS were the limitation, I would have 
expected the delivery rate to increase as the publish rate decreased while 
the consumers worked through the queue. It did not, however, as shown on 
the chart.

My question primarily is: *What do you think is limiting our consumption 
rate?* I'm curious about what affects consumption rate in general, though. 
Any advice would be appreciated at this point. Questions for clarification 
are also welcome!

A follow-up with version info that I forgot:

   - RabbitMQ 3.1.5
   - Erlang R14B04
   - .NET client 3.0.2

Also, I meant average message size is less than 1kB, not 1MB.

All of the consumer channels exhibit this sawtooth behavior. They also peak 
out at 40 messages/sec, which seems low since the prefetch is set at 200. 
Has anyone else seen this behavior?

As you can see from the above, the 'in_group' query returns false, so 
that's the problem.

By contrast, publishing to an exchange / consuming from a queue work 
because your config has '{constant, true}' for those.

What happened instead? Did you get an error in the browser? Are there
any errors in the rabbit log files? Did you check that management plugin
is enabled?

What do you mean by 'goes down'?

I have yet more details to add in case they help.

   - Technically, it's a 3-node cluster, but we took one of the nodes down 
   last week and have not added it back in because we've had some problems 
   with RabbitMQ becoming unresponsive when making those kinds of changes to 
   an active cluster. So we have two reporting nodes and one down node.
   - This morning, all 15 consumers maintained 30 messages per second 
   pretty constantly, but then we hit some delivery threshold (I'm not exactly 
   sure where), and they started the sawtooth behavior again and has been that 
   way since. 
   - We see publish spikes of 2-3x the normal rate every other minute, but 
   the consumers bounce from 40 messages/second to 0 four to five times per 
   minute, so it's not a direct correlation between the publish spikes and 
   delivery drops.

Hi,

We have a 4 node rabbitmq cluster with 2 master/slave pairs.  We have our
queues set up using a nodes policy, and we use priorities to have a catch
all mirror policy, e.g:

ha_appx        ^.+appx_.+    
{"ha-mode":"nodes","ha-params":["rabbit at mq3","rabbit at mq4"],"ha-sync-mode":"manual"}    
10
ha_appcatchall        ^.+    
{"ha-mode":"nodes","ha-params":["rabbit at mq1","rabbit at mq2"],"ha-sync-mode":"manual"}    
1

If we then add another policy for app_y with priority 10 the majority of the
queues for app_y disappear(from rabbitmqctl list_queues).  The bindings
still exist and stopping and restarting the consumers (which create the
queues if they don't exist) doesn't help.  The consumers still connect fine,
even for the queues that don't exist.  If the queue does exist the consumer
doesn't consume from that queue.  It almost seems like the queue is bouncing
around between the policies somehow.

If we create the priority 10 policies first there are no problems (all the
queues are created on rabbit at mq1 so the master is still being moved in that
scenario).  We can obviously work around by deleting the priority 1 policy
if we want to move queues, but after the issue has occurred the only way I
can find to fix it is to completely reset the cluster.  The nodes do not
shutdown cleanly, they just hang without stopping rabbit.

Cheers
Dan

Sorry also to clarify restarting the consumers should recreate queues if they
don't exist but it doesn't recreate the queues that have disappeared.  It's
like they are still lurking somewhere in the system but don't show up for
rabbitmqctl.

Hi Tyson,

Thanks for providing lots of background and environment information - that really helps. One thing you haven't mentioned is how your consumers are actually set up. Are you using basic.get or basic.consume, do they use basic.qos prefetch counts and how are ACKs being handled? Do individual consumer threads consume from multiple queues simultaneously, or is there a 1-2-1 correlation between channel, consumer and/or processing in the clients? Are consumers always connected to the node on which the master queue process (for the queue they're consuming from) resides, or the node hasting the queue slave/replica, or do you not know (because e.g., they connect via a load balancer)? In terms of that last question too - do you have any network kit between the broker and the consumers?  All of these things can impact on performance in a variety of ways.

Note that for a given queue, when consumers are unable to keep up with publishing, the broker will attempt to rate limit the producer(s) in order to give consumers time to catch up.

I also note that you're using a rather old version of Erlang/OTP - if it is possible to upgrade to a later release (i.e., R16B01 or at least one of the R15 releases) then it's definitely a good idea to do so, since lots of improvements and bug fixes have come in since R14. I don't however, think that the version of Erlang you're using is likely to be solely responsible for the behaviour you're observing.   

Cheers,
Tim

I've attached an image to this message that shows how we're able to keep up when the publish rate is less than 600 messages/second, but above that, consumption falls behind publication. Around 16:00 on that chart, we doubled the number of consumers, and it made no difference that we could tell. The erratic behavior of the publish rate is us turning off publishes of the most active queue because we were falling far enough behind that we became worried. When the backlog would get low enough, we would turn it back on, and we did that a few times.

Messages that fail for whatever reason during consumption will get put into the retry queues, and if they fail long enough, they'll wind up in the poison queue where they will stay until we do something with them manually much later. The main queues then see the majority of activity.

Hi Dan,

Some questions and points of clarification (inline, below) are in order first, I think...

On 2 Sep 2013, at 02:07, Dan_b wrote:

RabbitMQ nodes do not exhibit master/slave characteristics - those apply only to individual queues (where the master process resides on a specific node, and replicas/slaves on others).

Just to clarify then, any queue (name) that matches the `appx_' regex will be mirrored over the nodes on mq3 and mq4, whereas everything else will be mirrored across those on hosts mq1 and mq1.

To be clear - you are saying that you already have some (existing) queues that have names of the form app_y* that were declared on one of your nodes. You add another ha-mode policy that matches names of that form, and subsequently when running rabbitmqctl, you can no longer see these in list_queues - is that right? What exactly does the app_y policy that you're setting look like?

I would expect that if the bindings exist then the queues are still there, if not visible.

That's not really telling us much, since queue.declare is idempotent and won't fail even if the queue already exists.

>  The consumers still connect fine,
> even for the queues that don't exist.

Have you determined in any other way (besides `rabbitmqctl list_queues') that these queues no longer exist? Do you have the management plugin installed and if so, can you see them in the web UI? If your consumers have consumer cancel notifications enabled, are they getting fired at all?

That seems very unlikely. What exactly does the policy matching regex look like, and can you give a specific example of one of the queue names that you expect to match, which is also exhibiting this behaviour?

Hmn. Perhaps there is some bug at work here that only presents itself when the policy is created after the queue is declared. Are publishers and/or consumers already using the queue when the policy is introduced (at runtime) or not? You mention "... so the master is still being moved in that scenario..." - what exactly do you mean by this? Are you saying that at the point when the policy is introduced, the queue process is running on a node which is *not* part of the app_y policy's ha-params array? That is the only reason why a queue process that's already running (i.e., has been declared on a certain node) would be re-located if/when a policy is added or changed. If that is the case, how did you identify where the queue process (which will become the master) was originally running?

Why do you want to "move queues" at all? What exactly are you trying to achieve here? Are you deliberately using these policies to relocate queues that were running on a node that is not part of the ha-params for a new policy? Why would you want to do that? Not that I'm saying there's nothing wrong here - when the `nodes' policy is introduced, if the existing (and previously non-mirrored) queue is running elsewhere, the mirrors ought to be synchronised *first* and then the master will migrate once we're sure no message loss will ensue.

That sounds worrying. Can you provide log files (both the rabbit log *and* the sasl logs) from all of the nodes involved in these operations please?

Cheers,
Tim

Hi,

Tim. cheers for the clarifications.  I'm aware only individual queues are
mirrored but am using the master slave as an analogy (I'm trying to set up
the policies so it looks like 2 groups of 2 within the cluster using the
nodes policy).

All queues are pre-existing and created on mq1 - they all have publishers
and consumers connected.  We start with no policies.  When we create the
appx policy the appx queues successfully move from mq1 to be mirrored across
mq3 and mq4 and change the master to the first node in the policy (as
expected).  If we set the app_y policy without the catchall policy the same
thing happens and everything is hunky-dory.  However if we have the catch
all policy set before we set the app_y policy (effectively meaning the app_y
queues are mirrored across mq1 and mq2) and we then set the app_y policy the
queues disappear from list_queues and we are unable to consume from the
queue (note we don't have the consumer cancel notification property set in
our consumers so we have to manually restart consumers).

They app_y policy takes the exact form of the appx policy but with x
replaced by y.

Unfortunately we don't have the management plugin enabled.  I can try
setting up a similar situation in our dev environment (unfortunately this
has been happening in prod) to see if they will show up in the management
plugin.

The reason we want to move queues is for load balancing.  We want to enable
mirroring for redundancy (losing messages is bad news for us) but with the
overhead we're hitting max CPU and we'd like to scale out rather than up, so
we're balancing queues (we have almost 300) across 2 sets of 2 replicated
nodes (that seems to be the most deterministic way for us to scale).

There's no messages in the sasl log or in the normal log.  The server just
hangs indefinitely when trying to shutdown the node. I suspected the queues
still existed as well.  We have a python script for deleting queues and when
I tried that to delete one of the hidden queues it hung as well, but didn't
error (which is what happens when the queue doesn't exist).

An example of a queue name that matches is
OdometerService_appy_boundto_cooked_tx_y

>Just to clarify then, any queue (name) that matches the `appx_' regex will
be mirrored over the nodes on mq3 and mq4, whereas everything else will be
mirrored across those on hosts mq1 and mq2. 

This is correct.  The problem only presents when we use a policy with a
higher priority to change a queue that is already mirrored by the catchall
policy.  If we just change the nodes in an existing policy it is fine. 
Changing masters by restarting nodes also works fine.

Hi,

My question is in second machine also i need to define upstream and policy ?
if yes  than -

1 machine have Exchange - FE1 and Queue - Q1

2 machine have Exchange - FE2 and Queue - Q2

Now how they will talk to each other .

Example - if i send message to Q1 , how it will automatically publish to  Q2
also .

i hope i able to explain my doubt .

Thanks .

Hi Matthias, 

Yes, the management pluging is enabled.
ran rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management and restarted rabbitMQ
service.

The problem is with service startup, these are the logs generated just after
starting RabbitMQ as windows service.

Ah, right. It's complaining because the 3.1.5 schema has moved on from 
the 3.0.1 one.

RabbitMQ doesn't support seamless downgrades. You'll need to stop the 
service, delete the Mnesia directory, and start it up again.

Cheers, Simon

Hi Simon,

I have erlang otp_win64_R16B01 installed with the dir structure.
C:\Program Files\erl5.10.2\lib\mnesia-4.9.

Are you referring to this directory ? If not, is there any previous
compatible Erlanf version that I need to install for 3.0.1 ?

Thanks,
Tushar

Ah no, that's the implementation of Mnesia, don't delete that! I mean 
RabbitMQ's Mnesia storage directory. By default on Windows that's 
%APPDATA%\RabbitMQ\db. See http://www.rabbitmq.com/relocate.html for 
more on directory locations.

Cheers, Simon

Ah. As I said here: 
http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2013-September/029775.html 
that wasn't what you should delete. I'm afraid you'll need to remove and 
reinstall Erlang now.

Cheers, Simon

Hi Simon,

Sorry, misspelt your name earlier.

I deleted this file -
C:\Users\tmishr\AppData\Roaming\RabbitMQ\db\rabbit@<computerName>-mnesia
That worked. Its fantastic. You nailed the problem. Service is up.
Thanks very much for your time !!


Cheers,
Tushar

Hi Simon,

Sorry, I am just a few days old with RabbitMQ. Didn't understand Mnesia and
rabbitMQ at first. But its a bit clear now. I did not delete mnesia files
from erlang installation. Just removed and tested RabbitMQ service. And
placed it back again. 

Your guidance was very much helpful. 
Appreciate it !!

Thanks,
Tushar

You can find the full 6500lines of error messages here:

That's too bad. We won't be able to investigate this further w/o the

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Automated deployment of rabbit and clustering.
Message-ID: <CAFnCLtaRgfve30Q5ezT9wEqgvOCCKnbn7B9arReXb_Sj+V1NSQ@mail.gmail.com>

So I'm currently working on a project where we build deb packages for each
component for automated deployment. In looking at the docs around
clustering I have 1 main question.

In the naming of a node, or more specifically a rabbit broker, what
wildcard can I use so that the hosts name (which is automatically generated
when we need more capacity) of the conf file?

IE.

[{rabbit,
  [{cluster_nodes, {['rabbit at rabbit1', 'rabbit at rabbit2',
'rabbit at rabbit3'], disc}}]}].

"@rabbit1" needs to be an automatically generated hostname in the config
file as this is to be an automated process.

Any help appreciated.

That list is a list of hosts to contact to find out about the cluster. 
It is not required to contain the details of the entire cluster.

So I'm not sure how you can automatically generate it. You need to tell 
the new node where to find the cluster...

Hi,
I have following questions on handling RabbitMQ server failure scenarios:

*         In case of a crash, is service automatically restarted? Or can we make the service so?

*         What is the right way to handle crash/failure scenarios?

*         Is a heartbeat monitor or something like that provided by RabbitMQ?

Thanks,
Punit

I've replicated this. It seems to be related to changing policies in 
such a way that multiple nodes are removed from queues near-simultaneously.

So you should be able to work around this. In the case where your queues 
are mirrored in [mq1, mq2] and you want to add a policy to switch them 
to [mq3, mq4], you can initially define a policy to move them to [mq1, 
mq3, mq4] and then a few seconds later redefine that policy to [mq3, mq4].

We'll fix this in a future release, hopefully the next one.

Cheers, Simon

No, the broker does not ship with a heartbeat monitor, but there are
existing AMQP plugins available for monitoring systems. See
http://www.rabbitmq.com/how.html#management

Of course the broker should never crash (assuming no hardware or OS
faults). If your broker crashes so regularly that you need to automate
restarting then please let us know and supply the logfiles.

You should consider the use of high-availability queues if you expect
server or hardware faults, or if you have high availability
requirements: http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html

So if I were to point it at a load balancer, this would work as the load
balancer should automatically add new nodes as they become available?

Message-ID: <48F1E182B1021B449414C85E713CE8250DEAB1@WLT-MBX03.KRONOS.com>

Hi

I installed erlang (using root account) from EPEL following instructions on http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#howtouse

Step1: enable epel on RHEL6

su -c 'rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm'

I ran the above command and now this rpm is installed.

Step 2:
yum install erlang
threw the following errors:
...
...
--> Processing Dependency: libodbc.so.2()(64bit) for package: erlang-odbc-R14B-04.2.el6.x86_64

           Requires: tk
You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem
You could try running: rpm -Va --nofiles --nodigest


I installed erlang using the -skip-broken switch.

Then I downloaded rabbitmq-server-3.1.5-1.noarch.rpm for RHEL from http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html

Yum install rabbitmq-server-3.1.5-1.noarch.rpm

throws the same errors as before:
...
...
---> Package erlang-odbc.x86_64 0:R14B-04.2.el6 will be installed

           Requires: tk

I can do a yum install of rabbitmq server using the -skip-broken. I just want to know if these errors are going to pose a problem later...

Please advise.

You can use any OS provided that the version of Erlang and RabbitMQ
match. You could even mix Windows and Unix.

If your change from CentOS to RedHat involves recreating the filesystem
and preserves the hostname then consider making a backup of the Mnesia
database directory and restore to maintain persistent messages and
resources. Also backup the config file if you have one.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ queue durability question
Message-ID: <522596C5.5010300@econsys.co.za>

Hi,

I have the following environment:
Server: (Language: Erlang, Version: 2.7.1)
Broker: (Version: 3.1.5)
Client: (Language: Grails/Groovy, Version: 2.8.4)

I am using RPC functionality over the broker.
A queue is created by the server or the client has the following 
configuration:
|auto delete|, |durable| and |exclusive| attributes are set to |false|

The problem:
If the client and the server is not active and the broker restarts the 
queue does not survive the restart and it behaves as required.
If the client and the server is active and the broker restarts then the 
broker change the queue durability to|durable|: true and it survives the 
restart.

This causes chaos with the server behaviour.
The server tries to recover the connection and recreate the queue with 
configuration of |auto delete|, |durable| and |exclusive| attributes are 
set to |false. |In turn the creation of the queue to fails because of 
the changed durability.

Why does the broker change the durability of the queue?
Is that the correct behaviour?

Any help or advice shall be highly appreciated.

Thanks

There was a bug with that stack trace fixed in 2.8.3. Are you running an 
earlier version?

That is not possible, because the non-durable queue is not present on
startup. The broker can't change the queue durability, and neither can a
client. A queue must be deleted before the durability or any other
attribute can be changed.

A possible explanation is that the server and client don't create the
queue with the same attributes, and you see different behaviour
depending on which one gets to declare the queue.

I promise you it doesn't. If there was a bug in that region it would 
affect more or less everyone.

Are you absolutely sure no client could be doing that?

Make sure your package manager is set up in such a way that these
dependencies can be installed. A correctly installed base OS should be
able to do this.

Alternatively select one of the other providers of an Erlang package
which does not depend on these packages, e.g. the package from VMware
which is monolithic and more up-to-date:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html

I would use "--skip-broken" only if no other option could possibly work.
While the broker will run because it does not depend on tk or libodbc,
you should avoid broken packages.

Hi Emile

I am using libraries in the respective implementations.
Server:
I am using the amqp_rpc_server from the amqp_client.
 From the source code:

     process_flag( trap_exit, true ),

     %% Get config from config file for the server and port
     Params =
     #amqp_params_network
     {
         username  = amqp_conf:username()
         ,password = amqp_conf:password()
         ,host     = amqp_conf:server()
         ,port     = amqp_conf:port()
     },

     try amqp_connection:start( Params ) of
         {ok, Connection}
         ->
             {
                 ok
                 ,State#state
                 {
                   connection    = Connection
                   ,time_started = {date(), time()}
                   ,server       = amqp_rpc_server:start( Connection, 
State#state.queue, State#state.handler )
                 }
             }
     catch
         _:Reason -> {stop, Reason}
     end

Client:
I am using the RabbitMQ plugin for Grails:

// RabbitMQ
rabbitmq
{
     connectionfactory
     {
         username = 'guest';
         password = 'guest';
         hostname = '127.0.0.1';
         consumers = 1;
     }

     retryPolicy {
         maxAttempts = 3
     }

     queues =
     {
         'unitrac.application.MaxManV1.RPC'()
     }
}

 From the documentation:
" the|autoDelete|,|durable|and|exclusive|attributes default to|false|and 
the|arguments|attribute defaults to null."

According to me the server and the client declare the queue with the 
same attributes, but I will investigate more by only having one of them 
active when I restart the broker. That will indicate which one is 
responsible.

Thanks for the response.

I just wanted to be sure that the behaviour of the broker with or 
without a server or a client must be the same.

I am busy taking a another look at it.

Thanks

Here's your problem. RabbitMQ Grails plugin uses two different constructors to
create a Queue instance (that comes from Spring-AMQP, as far as I can see):

https://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-rabbitmq/blob/master/src/groovy/org/grails/rabbitmq/RabbitQueueBuilder.groovy#L30

Now look at the single argument constructor in org.spring.amqp.core.Queue:
http://static.springsource.org/spring-amqp/api/org/springframework/amqp/core/Queue.html

It says "The queue is durable, non-exclusive and non auto-delete".

So looks like *some* of the time your Grails app was started without a config param that
led the Grails plugin to create a durable exchange.

This should read "a durable queue", of course.

Jan,

Please report this to grails-rabbitmq maintainers [1] with a link to this
thread [2]. They should stop using the 1-argument Queue constructor
and provide default arguments explicitly.

Hi Michael,

Many thanks for the feedback.

I re-tested and found that the Grails client is the one that creates the 
queue with the durability set to true.

I will report this to the grails-rabbitmq maintainers.

Thanks
Jan

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] [PATCH] Suggestions for improving the RabbitMQ
	Erlang Client
Message-ID: <CAGrdgiXvjqL8W_Nyi9mmhuWRSo0_Z3fW7res4gY-X712Yci8XQ@mail.gmail.com>

# Optimizing the Erlang RabbitMQ Client

I originally thought about this as a blog post, but as I don't really have
time finishing it up and polishing it more, I'd just write it here on the
mailing list instead. There are some patches in the mail you may want to
grab and apply on the RabbitMQ Erlang client. In my benchmarks, they helped
me get some more performance squeezed out of my systems in the ballpark of
15-40% more Messages per second.

My benchmark is quite synthetic and bad since it goes great lengths at
playing on all of AMQPs weaknesses. But the patches are probably quite
sound and picks out the low?hanging?fruit there is in there. In the end, I
have written some of the ideas I have for further improvement of the
client. But I did not have the time to do so, and currently, it is fast
enough for our purposes, our load being well under an order of magnitude
lower than the limits it imposes on systems.

In any case, you may want to grab the patches I made since they would
probably help any Erlang RabbitMQ client user. This message was due to me
complaining to Alvaro `gifsockets` Videla about the Erlang client, and he
urged me to write up my findings. So here goes nothing:

## The setup

The current setup is like this:

* Run a RabbitMQ server version 3.1.5.
* Run a fairly recent RabbitMQ erlang client. We use version 3.1.1, but
there are so few changes on it that it doesn't matter it is not the newest
version.
* We run everything on localhost.
* We run with Erlang/OTP R16B01
* We make two connections to RMQ
* One connection manages a "sender" channel, run by a single "sender"
process.
* The other connection runs 10 channels, each channel having a "Handler
function"

The setup is somewhat suboptimal. The same machine runs everything so there
are certain nice optimization like setting scheduler bind types and so on
which won't really help that much. Furthermore, we don't tune memory
allocators, which I have a hunch could help in these situations.

A test is the following:

* We spawn 100 processes. These send 10000 messages each and wait for a
reply.
* The Handlers reply via reply_to queues.
* All messages are very small. A few bytes. We want to test messaging
capability.
* We thus run one million (10?) RPC queries. Each query is two messages: A
request and a reply.
* The single "sender" multiplexes and demultiplexes the 100 worker
processes. This is a known bottleneck in the code base.

## Initial state

I have a Core i7-3630QM Based laptop. Making sure it is not running on
battery, we can process roughly 12.5k RPS (RPC's per second) on this setup.
When running, it seems we max out all cores in the machine. Roughly 3 cores
go to RMQ, 4 cores go to our test case and the last core does other stuff
like playing spotify. My benchmark surely runs in a highly controlled
environment :)

What is odd though, is the load of 400% on the Client Erlang node. Why on
*earth* is the client doing more work than the server?

When debugging stuff like this, the first thing to look at is bottom of
things. We must make sure the kernel and the network is behaving like we
expect them to. Old trusty *tcpdump* always comes to the rescue for these
kinds of things. We grab a typical run on disk just to see what is
happening.

tcpdump -i lo -w tcp.dump 'port 5672'
Given such a trace, we can analyze it in tcptrace and in Wireshark. It can
tell us if there are anything odd to look for in the handling of the
low-level communication. Here is a simple breakdown of the packet sizes:

Size Count Percent
40-79 417900 12.38%
 [?]
160-329 2814258 83.37%

This is *very* odd. A localhost interface has an MTU of 64 Kilobytes. Yet,
most packets are extremely small. RabbitMQ disables Nagle's algorithm
through setting *TCP_NODELAY* and it does not look like there is good
handling of it. Most of the packets we transfer are pretty small. This is
quite nasty for performance.

Wireshark tells us we can push around 65.5 megabit through the link. This
isn't a lot on a localhost interface. I had a hunch something might be
wrong with the TCP window, but it never closes according to Wireshark, so
this can not be the case.

The major problem here is that we are not filling up packets for some
reason and are sending way too small IP datagrams for this to ever be fast.
We are dying by processing small packets.

## Eprof

Another useful approach is to use the *eprof* profiler. We hook amqp_client
and change the main application start callback such that it will profile
its own tree:

 start(_StartType, _StartArgs) ->
eprof:start_profiling([self()]),
amqp_sup:start_link().

In our test case, we can now run a call to `eprof:stop_profiling()`
followed by a call to `eprof:log/1` and `eprof:analyze()`. This only
profiles the amqp_client, not our own test code which we use to load it.
Hence, all the time reported is spent in the AMQP side of things. We could
also try to optimize the test code, but for now, the focus is on the
`amqp_client` side of things. We get a lot of interesting output, most
notably one for a process doing a lot of work:

 ****** Process <0.184.0>    -- 18.45 % of profiled time ***

 [      3.34]

This process runs around 20% of the load and runs roughly 6 million calls
to `erts_internal:port_control/3`. This is odd. We would expect there to be
fewer calls. Since we are passing both the request and the reply through
this area in the code base, it seems odd that we are making 6 calls per
RPC. In fact, the number shouldn't even be two! We are passing a *lot* of
data through the socket so we expect Erlang to be able to pick up a lot of
data and process it with a single call to the underlying socket. Not a call
per message which is very expensive.

Looking into the `amqp_main_reader` module, we see that it handles the
underlying socket in a very odd way. First, it reads exactly 7 bytes off
the socket for the AMQP header. From this it obtains the payload length and
then it reads the payload length. This means two context switches to get a
single packet. And the reason why we are spending all the time in port
control.

The optimization is straight forward: Read as much data as possible from
the underlying socket per call. Then process as much data as you can before
going to the socket again. There are basically two scenarios. Either the
socket is not loaded at all and then there are no reason to even think
about optimization. Or the socket is loaded in which case we should
optimize for the fast path. The fast path in this case is that all data is
available for a message. If not, we can just append data to the old data

<<OldData/binary, NewData/binary>>

since in Erlang releases after OTP R12B this will use the extra capacity
allocated for binaries and avoid copying in most cases anyhow. Also, when
the socket is running slowly, a bit of extra copying like this is not going
to be a problem. Whereas if the socket processes lots of data, we can
fast?path the code. In other words, the natural implementation is
reasonably fast. Implementing this change immediately pushes messages per
second to 31k, so we are up 6000 or around 3000 RPC calls.

It also pushes the 6 million calls down to 6 * 10? shaving off an order of
magnitude calls. And it shuffles the load in the system to other parts for
now. The main problem now is the small packets being pushed all the time,
which has to do with the send?path in RabbitMQ.

## Next optimizations

After these optimizations we have the following breakdown:

amqp_channels_manager 9.91% time

It uses its time for two things. First, for decoding incoming frames. And
secondly on looking up and updating a `gb_trees` structure mapping to the
channel.

amqp_main_reader 8.64% time
 amqp_main_reader 7.43% time

Most of the time is now spent decoding and analyzing frames in the two main
reader processes. They are not working on the socket and using around 20%
cpu each. Rather, they are spending the time in the frame decoder loop,
which is exactly where we want them to spend their time. Optimizing further
is definitely a great idea, but Amdahl tells us there are other culprits
where we can gain more by optimizing.

amqp_channels_manager 8.81% time
amqp_direct_consumer 4.32% time
 amqp_channel 13.11% time
rabbit_writer 14.45% time
 This is around 66.6% of all time spent for the selected processes and
their underlying modules. The remaining 33% are in the same modules, but
for processes that spend less than 2% time each. For the second round, the
major processes to look into is the channel itself and the rabbit_writer
process. Perhaps looking at the latter can tell us why packets are so
small. And looking into the former can explain why we spend so much time
handling channels.

Let us look at what the `rabbit_writer` is doing. It manages writing of
frames to the underlying socket. It can write in two modes, which are the
ubiquituous async and sync variants. The idea is that you can buffer up
writes before pushing them onto the socket, which is running in TCP_NODELAY
mode. This means that we can get low latency operation, but it also
requires us to handle buffering in our end. Otherwise the packets will get
small. Who calls rabbit writer?

 # `gg` is an alias for [git grep -n "$@"]
 ; gg rabbit_writer:
 src/amqp_channel.erl:784:              {network, none, _}  ->
rabbit_writer:send_command_sync(W, Method);
 src/amqp_channel.erl:785:              {network, _, _}     ->
rabbit_writer:send_command_sync(W, Method,
 src/amqp_network_connection.erl:56:    catch
rabbit_writer:send_command_sync(Writer, Method).

Ouch! All writes are synchronous! This means we are forcing a flush to the
underlying socket whenever we write something on it. And we are forcing a
context switch from the `amqp_channel` code to the `rabbit_writer` all the
time, even though we don't need to do so. This accounts for the small
packets we are seeing when we are writing. The response is written on the
socket and then it immediately pushes the result because of TCP_NODELAY. It
also means each write results in a write to the underlying erlang `port()`
which is quite expensive.

[
https://github.com/issuu/amqp_client/commit/42856090936e7196eab6c8e71107a479883f97a9.patch
]

RabbitMQ itself does not use the sync writes for anything but closing down
the line. So we can probably safely change to use async writes on the
socket. The change severely cuts down on the amount of calls to the
`port()` since they can now happen in larger batches.

The change does not help too much on the packet sizes however. Most packets
are still small due to TCP_NODELAY and due to how the processing is
happening on the interface. The main loop looks like this:

 mainloop1(State) ->
     receive
         Message -> ?MODULE:mainloop1(handle_message(Message, State))
     after 0 ->
             ?MODULE:mainloop1(internal_flush(State))
     end.

So if the mailbox is usually small, then we will often push out small
packets. Looking at a running system through the `observer` application
shows us that the main users of reductions in the system is currently
`amqp_channels_mgr` and our muxing client we use for the test.

## Two major problems

The main problems at this point is two?fold: We spend a lot of time
decoding and encoding packets. And we spend an extremely high amount of
time finding the correct channel endpoint for a message. The reason for the
latter is simply the fact that every time we find an appropriate channel
process, we also update the appropriate assembler state. And we run the
decoder loop in the channels manager.

The assembler state is a protocol verifier. It tracks the protocol version
and it checks the next frame matches the expected frame in question. This
is of course a nice and necessary thing to do. But keeping all channels in
the same process and managing the decoder loop like this is odd. We get no
parallel execution on the connection and we have to update a state map for
the assembler state all the time. Furthermore, by decoding first and then
passing data, we will have to send more complex messages rather than simply
a binary reference.

I would probably have chosen a design based on an ETS lookup table. And
then have kept the state in the channel process itself to maximize parallel
behaviour. In turn, we can avoid spending a lot of time updating internal
memory state in a process on the critical path which would speed up the
system by quite a lot. Also, we are paying reductions on busy channels.
This will help fairness.

Also, this means we can do away with the channels_manager process entirely.
There is no need since a decoded message can just be forwarded to the
channel directly, skipping an unneeded message pass on the critical decoder
path.

## More controversial patches to `rabbit_writer`

The writer process inside RabbitMQ is something I wanted to optimize as
well, so I tried changing two things in it. First, I avoided a
recomputation of `iolist_size/1` on every received message. And I just
dropped keeping a small 1414 byte packet size around. The rationale is
this: either we will be running at a high pace in the writer code and then
easily exceed the 1414 byte packet size. In this case, bumping it to 64
kilobytes and making few calls to the underlying port seems to be the right
thing to do. Otherwise, we will be running slowly, which means we will
eventually be able to empty the mailbox of the writer process. When this
happens, we will flush whatever is in our buffer anyway. The controversy is
the fact that if we get into a situation where the writer is kept buffering
all the time, then the 64 kilobyte window is quite large and may take time
to fill. But I guess this won't happen since writing like this will be
awfully fast and it is unlikely that you will be overwhelmed with exactly
that kind of slow-but-steady trickling of messages in practice.

]

While here, I don't know why we are producing an iolist() in the reverse
direction of what we need. Rather, we can just build up an iolist() tree
and then send it out over the line. This avoids a reverse on the critical
path and there is no reason to do that:

https://github.com/issuu/rabbit_common/commit/15c270fcb75ab758d312cf0e4d1d5864127f5244.patch
]

This patch is also slightly controversial since it may not be what you guys
want to do. Furthermore, it did not increase the send and receive rates in
a significant way in my tests.

Jesper,

This is totally awesome, thanks for all your efforts! Quite a few of these items we already have open bugs for, but we've not prioritised optimising the Erlang client up until now. I will however, be picking up these patches and looking at incorporating them. Is it ok if I contact you offline if and when I need to discuss the changes?

Cheers,
Tim

But the patches are probably quite sound and picks out the low?hanging?fruit there is in there. In the end, I have written some of the ideas I have for further improvement of the client. But I did not have the time to do so, and currently, it is fast enough for our purposes, our load being well under an order of magnitude lower than the limits it imposes on systems.

The idea is that you can buffer up writes before pushing them onto the socket, which is running in TCP_NODELAY mode. This means that we can get low latency operation, but it also requires us to handle buffering in our end. Otherwise the packets will get small. Who calls rabbit writer?

And we are forcing a context switch from the `amqp_channel` code to the `rabbit_writer` all the time, even though we don't need to do so. This accounts for the small packets we are seeing when we are writing. The response is written on the socket and then it immediately pushes the result because of TCP_NODELAY. It also means each write results in a write to the underlying erlang `port()` which is quite expensive.

And I just dropped keeping a small 1414 byte packet size around. The rationale is this: either we will be running at a high pace in the writer code and then easily exceed the 1414 byte packet size. In this case, bumping it to 64 kilobytes and making few calls to the underlying port seems to be the right thing to do. Otherwise, we will be running slowly, which means we will eventually be able to empty the mailbox of the writer process. When this happens, we will flush whatever is in our buffer anyway. The controversy is the fact that if we get into a situation where the writer is kept buffering all the time, then the 64 kilobyte window is quite large and may take time to fill. But I guess this won't happen since writing like this will be awfully fast and it is unlikely that you will be overwhelmed with exactly that kind of slow-but-steady trickling of messages in practice.

What do you mean "work in RabbitMQ" exactly? If you asking about running java components inside the broker, then no, that will not work. RabbitMQ is not written in Java. However you can integrate java components into RabbitMQ via the external-exchange-plugin, and more to the point, you can use spring integration to wire up message driven beans easily. Whether or not there is an EJB 3.x compatibility layer that uses the standard javax EJB annotations, I'm not so sure.

Cheers,
Tim

Hi Tim,

We connecting RabbitMQ using Java Client. In the existing project we didn't
use RabbitMQ, we have used MDBs for consuming messages. Now we want to
replace existing Queue with RabbitMQ. So, for this what changes we need to
do in java MDBs in order use in RabbitMQ?

MDBs require JMS

If you are saying you want to convert your MDBs to message-driven java
classes that work with RabbitMQ instead, see the Spring-AMQP reference
document, section 3.5

Yes Gary, MDBs require JMS. I have gone through the documentation which is
available in the above URL. So, if we follow these we need to rewrite the
consumer code instead of making use of existing MDBs. Rewriting the entire
code is only the option or is there any approach which we can make use of
MDBs?

Make sure your package manager is set up in such a way that these dependencies can be installed. A correctly installed base OS should be able to do this.

Alternatively select one of the other providers of an Erlang package which does not depend on these packages, e.g. the package from VMware which is monolithic and more up-to-date:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-rpm.html

I would use "--skip-broken" only if no other option could possibly work.
While the broker will run because it does not depend on tk or libodbc, you should avoid broken packages.

You could try using the Qpid JMS client. However as far as I know MDB 
integration has only been tested over AMQP 0-10. In theory the client 
supports other versions including 0-9-1 and there is also a 1.0 based 
JMS client, but there may be some issues getting JCA working over those 
to your satisfaction. One point to make is that XA transactions would 
*not* work over any of the other versions as the specs don't define 
support for that.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] rabbitmq-erlang-client rpc zombie process after
	broker restart
Message-ID: <52260460.9040606@econsys.co.za>

Hi,

amqp_rpc_server.erl use the default options to create the queue used for 
the RPC.

The queue attributes are as follows:

-record('queue.declare', {ticket = 0, queue = <<"">>, passive = false, 
durable = false, exclusive = false, auto_delete = false, nowait = false, 
arguments = []}).

This results in a non durable queue. Thus if the broker restarts, the 
queue will terminate and not be available on restart.

The gen server process will remain alive and not terminate and rendering 
it unusable.

Is the correct behaviour?

Any help or advice shall be highly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] ANN Logstash 1.2 is out with a new RabbitMQ
	plugin
Message-ID: <EE099AB1-A3BA-420A-85C3-3F3248C668F9@rabbitmq.com>

I'm happy to report to all Logstash users on this list that
Logstash 1.2 is out and it features a completely rewritten RabbitMQ plugin:

https://github.com/logstash/logstash/blob/master/CHANGELOG

It should be backwards compatible configuration-wise. Note that it now
requires you to run RabbitMQ 2.0 or later.

Among many improvements in this version, you will see x4-6 better
throughput for RabbitMQ output and x3-4 for RabbitMQ input (with a single instance)
on JRuby. There will be some improvements on CRuby, too, just not as significant.

I am thinking of having rabbitmq for a SAAS application, that users will be 
able to use it to queue data to be processed for them. I was thinking about 
giving every user there own login. But not sure how rabbitmq will react 
when there are 1000s or 10,000 users in the system and if it will effect 
login times?

Users are just entries in the Mnesia database and your numbers are low
enough that the impact will probably be negligible. If you have any
doubts then you should run a small test to confirm.

Well, every release has bug fixes, so in general I would suggest you 
upgrade to the latest version (3.1.5 at time of writing).

But there are a few incompatibilities between 2.x and 3.x (see 
https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2012/11/19/breaking-things-with-rabbitmq-3-0/) 
so if upgrading to 3.1.x will take too long then 2.8.7 should be the 
same as 2.8.2, just with fewer bugs.

Cheers, Simon

I'd expect the impact to become measurable when the rabbit_user* tables
start consuming many megabytes, but that's just a guess. Beyond that the
question depends on your threshold for concern.

I urge you to try this out for yourself if you have concerns. Perhaps
you could report back on the results?

Hi Alan!

Related to your answer and after install rabbitmq-c, now everything works
fine!

Thanks for support.

Message-ID: <0a84e1f7cb834676baab3d4e096969b2@AM3PR06MB210.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Hello

We are running a two node RabbitMQ 3.1.5 (Erlang R16B01) cluster that recently has been crashing quite often, a couple of times every week.
The log gives no information on what is happening, but there is an erl_crash.dump file in /var/lib/rabbitmq. 
The top of the file says:

Slogan: std_alloc: Cannot allocate 1124815738393216 bytes of memory (of type "arg_reg").

I have attached the gzipped crash dump.

We are using rabbitmq-server 3.1.5-1 and erlang 1:16.b.1-dfsg-4 from Debian. The crashes happened with Erlang R15B01 as well.

Regards,

Oskar Liljeblad (oskar at vergic.com)

Which AMQP client are you using?

Can you confirm the frame_max configuration value of the broker? You can
get this from "rabbitmqctl environment".

Would it be possible to obtain a network capture of the AMQP traffic
leading up to such a crash?

Has anything in your environment changed at the onset of the crashes?

The only thing that may have changed is that we enabled mirroring on some of the queues. But the first crash may have happened just before this - I'm afraid I don't remember.

Frame max setting: {frame_max,131072}

AMQP client: C# RabbitMQ.Client.3.1.1

It may be possible to capture the traffic, but there's quite a few requests to these servers so I suspect the traffic dumps would be very large.
I could look into this though.

Regards,

Oskar

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Help with topics not working from Pika
Message-ID: <52272E52.80607@ontrenet.com>

Hi,
   I have a bizarre situation with topics working and not working in 
pika. Pretty sure this is a bug of some kind.
I adapted the topic pub/sub example slightly and found that it doesn't 
act like a topic anymore, but a direct queue.

Clearly these two files establish a topic exchange and bind a queue to 
it and should thus behave like a topic,
but it behaves like a direct queue only.

Step 1. In one window run "python receive_1.py _workflow"
Step 2. In another window run "python receive_1.py _workflow"
Step 3. In a third window run "python emit_1.py _workflow"

Only one of the receivers gets the message. If you continue to run emit_1.py
it distributes between your two receivers.

Can I not declare a queue name and bind it to a topic exchange? It seems 
not.

Here are the files:

emit_1.py
============================================
#!/usr/bin/env python
import pika
import sys

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(
         host='localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()

channel.exchange_declare(exchange='workflow',
                          type='topic')

routing_key = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else 'anonymous.info'
message = ' '.join(sys.argv[2:]) or 'Hello World!'
channel.basic_publish(exchange='workflow',
                       routing_key=routing_key,
                       body=message)
print " [x] Sent %r:%r" % (routing_key, message)
connection.close()



and receive_1.py
============================================
#!/usr/bin/env python
import pika
import sys

connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(
         host='localhost'))
channel = connection.channel()

channel.exchange_declare(exchange='workflow',
                          type='topic')

result = channel.queue_declare(queue='workflow')
queue_name = result.method.queue

binding_keys = sys.argv[1:]
if not binding_keys:
     print >> sys.stderr, "Usage: %s [binding_key]..." % (sys.argv[0],)
     sys.exit(1)

for binding_key in binding_keys:
     print "binding_key ",binding_key
     channel.queue_bind(exchange='workflow',
                        queue=queue_name,
                        routing_key=binding_key)

print ' [*] Waiting for logs. To exit press CTRL+C'

def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
     print " [x] %r:%r" % (method.routing_key, body,)

channel.basic_consume(callback,
                       queue=queue_name,
                       no_ack=True)

channel.start_consuming()

Because both receivers declare a queue with the same name, they both get 
the same queue. Each message can only exist once in a queue, so 
therefore you distribute the messages between the two receivers.

To get each (matching) message routed to each receiver, each receiver 
needs its own queue, and hence its own queue name. The simplest way to 
do this is with server-named queues as discussed in tutorial 3.

Cheers, Simon

For an explanation of how messages are distributed when multiple consumers
share a queue, see tutorial 2:
https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python.html

Message routing happens between queues, not between consumers.

See https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html if you are still not
sure about the concepts.

Only the last packets exchanged before a crash should be enough, so the
dump that you send need not be enormous.

Your attached crash dump never made it to the mailing list. Could you
please resend?

Can you also please include the output of "rabbitmqctl report"?

An opinion offered on the erlang-questions mailing list about a similar
question suggests that the error logger is responsible for attempting
the allocation:
http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2012-May/066600.html

I hesitate to suggest this for a production environment but try turning
logging off to see if that helps.

Change "'{file,"'${RABBITMQ_LOGS}'"}'" to "false" and
'{file,"'${RABBITMQ_SASL_LOGS}'"}' to "false" in
/usr/lib/rabbitmq/bin/rabbitmq-server.

If that cures the problem then we'll need to find a way of determining
what the original error was that triggered the large error message.

I restarted the service but I see the usual log messages regarding accepted and closed AMQP connections - now only in /var/log/rabbitmq/startup_log (which I assume is stdout) rather than /var/log/rabbitmq/rabbitmq at instance.log

Even if I restore the backup copy of mnesia in 3.1.0 and then start rabbitmq-server....the logs show failed message. Is there any fix for this problem?

RabbitMQ does not support automatic downgrading.

Matt,
Then how should I approach the downgrading process and preserve the cluster
configs and persistent messages ?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] amqpcpp | Temp Queue
Message-ID: <1378314695454-29342.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,

This is my scenario:

We have a scneario where in the consumer will create a temperory queue and
wait on that queue till it gets a message from the publisher. Each temperory
queue can have more than one consumer and there can be multiple temperory
queues like this. The consumer will disconnect from the queue after
consuming one message.

I'm using a 'Topic' exchange as there are specific messages that needs to
get published to these queues based on a routing key. 

How can I make sure that all the consumers listening on a queue will get the
message published and the temp queue should get deleted after that? Any tips
or sample code snippet will be of great help.   

Regards,
Antony.

I'm not familiar with this project or Qt but [1] suggests the program is a port of
RabbitMQ tutorials [2]. [3] seems to demonstrate a help banner that is printed
if you run it as

qamqp --help

[4] is the library code.

I suspect that the upgrade step in the release you are trying assumes a different
[internal] database schema from what you actually have after upgrading to 3.1.

Without writing code to perform a reverse migration, broker won't start. Unfortunately,
some migrations simply cannot be reversed (e.g. if a column was removed
from a table).

See http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server/file/5740b52b882e/src/rabbit_upgrade.erl
to learn what's involved in a database upgrade.

RabbitMQ with Qt


I am new to RabbitMQ with Qt.  I downloaded the code from 
https://github.com/fuCtor/QAMQP on Windows and I successfully compiled the 
code (using qmake/nmake) to produce qamqp.exe.  When I run the executable 
on the command line it just does not do anything.  I don't see any errors 
also.  I have RabbitMQ installed.

As I said to Tyson, if you ant more specific guidance then you'll need to provide further information about how you are consuming, what your topology looks like and so on. It's great that the cluster topology, environment details and use of HA and durability are specified, but how many queues are we talking about, how many consumers per queue, how are consumers configured, etc etc? Feel free to post that info and we can try to point out what might be causing this kind of behaviour. For just one example, if a network connection to one of the consumers is slow, or a consumer is slow to respond, and you have prefect-count set to 1, then *all* the consumers will be affected.

Cheers,
Tim

I've attached an image to this message that shows how we're able to keep up when the publish rate is less than 600 messages/second, but above that, consumption falls behind publication. Around 16:00 on that chart, we doubled the number of consumers, and it made no difference that we could tell. The erratic behavior of the publish rate is us turning off publishes of the most active queue because we were falling far enough behind that we became worried. When the backlog would get low enough, we would turn it back on, and we did that a few times.

If examples work with your exchange, it means something is different in your code.
Please post at least some relevant parts of it.

What I meant to say there was if "some consumers are slow to respond" then it can affect *others* - someone just pointed out that I didn't state that very clearly. Anyway, the point is that many factors can affect delivery rates, so we need as much info as possible.

Looking at your problem from a high-level: if you have a single message in
a queue, and multiple consumers attached to that queue, that message will
only ever be delivered to one consumer. A possible alternative topology
would be to have each consumer have its own temp queue, then for each temp
queue bind it to the exchange so that the message(s) in question get
delivered to all the necessary queues, the upon successfully consuming the
desired message the consuming entities could delete the queue in question.

I haven't used amqpcpp extensively so I don't know the in's and out's of
that library enough to give you a solid example.  I'd recommend checking
out the examples and starting from there to see if you can do what you need
to do.

Sorry, it seems I failed to attach it properly. I blame M$ technologies
(Outlook). Now I'm running a more decent e-mail client so the crash dump should
be attached.

As for the rabbitmqctl report output, I will mail you that directly.

Message-ID: <7F414B031B795146A3697F7EF8C506675E2C41@SQYL07EXMAIL7.quebec.int.ec.gc.ca>

Hi rabbitmq gurus

     I am a newbee  ... sorry.

     I have several producers (python-amqplib)  sending a total of half a million messages per day
     to my rabbitmq-server 3.1.15
     They all use topic.
     I have one consumer that sits there receiving a particular  topic   (275000 messages/daily)

     The connections for both the producers and the consumers are sustained... (connections are opened and are left
     that way unless someone  restarts one of them)

     Every runs smoothly for a while... 
     than  for no apparent reason,  my consumer is missing  some messages from one producer... 
     The producer still sends messages...   I simply restart the producer and the problem is resolved...

     Before restarting 
     netstat -an     tells me that the connections are established
     an so does
     rabbitmqctl list_connections

 
     Any Idea of the source of my problem ?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Connections made to slaves when a master fail
 (and a slave is promoted) stop receiving messages
Message-ID: <fadf8506-9877-42df-a622-94983ce16307@googlegroups.com>

Hi guys,

after complaining about RabbitMQ HA mode in twitter[1], I got a response by 
?lvaro (@old_sound)[2] stating that I should post my problem here. Fair 
enough, here are my details:

Architecture: simple RabbitMQ 2.8.x cluster with two machines. 
Usage: really simple pub-sub on a topic. Nothing fancy. Queues on 'all' 
mirroring.
Library: node-amqp for Node.js [3], v0.1.7, as published on npm, not on 
github)

The symptons are:

1) We connect to several logical brokers from each of our nodes. This means 
that we are connected to the master and slaves of each queue.
2) When the master fails, RabbitMQ selects the eldest slave and promotes to 
be the master.
3) "The slave considers all previous consumers to have been abruptly 
disconnected."[4] So we end up with the connections NOT being closed but 
not binded to any queue, and no information from RabbitMQ to the "slave" 
consumers. This means that we have the connection, we do not have any error 
message, but we stop receiving any further messages.

I have read the documentation and I think this is the expected behaviour, 
but I'm more than open to improve our code to solve this problems.

Thanks,

Guillermo

Thanks Alan and sorry for the additional email.

Do you have any example for creating temporary queue in rabbitmq-c? 

I have done it in Java using 

String queueName = channel.queueDeclare().getQueue(); 

But not able to figure the corresponding thing in rabbitmq-c?

Regards,
Antony.

Hi,

It?s not HA specific but in general a clustering issue. As far as I can tell, it?s a miss in the AMQP 0.9.1 specification, but luckily there is a RabbitMQ specific extension called ?consumer cancellation?: http://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-cancel.html
RabbitMQ 2.8 broker supports that, the question is if your client does.

Regards,
Tobias

Here's and example on creating a temp queue in rabbitmq-c:

https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c/blob/master/examples/amqp_consumer.c#L186

Essentially you need to pass a 0-length string as the queue-name when doing
a queue.declare (amqp_queue_declare()).

The generated name of the queue will be returned by the broker (in the
amqp_queue_declare_ok_t struct).  You can use this to do a queue.delete
(amqp_queue_delete()) later or if its a queue declared with auto-delete
set, the queue will be destroyed when the consumer count falls to 0, or the
channel that created is closed.

minor correction: That last bit happens when the creating *connection* 
closes, and the queue was declared as 'exclusive'.

I am curious... when is such a scenario needed? I don't think creating and
destroying queues like this is going to be efficient in the long run, but
it is a *very* common pattern in certain concurrency settings: You pass a
one-message mailbox and synchronize on the response appearing in that
mailbox. I've done this in several Haskell programs, but there I tend to
reuse the mailbox so I don't run the overhead of creating/destroying it all
the time as well.

Isn't there a clever way you can set up reply-queues and use correlation
id's to achieve the same?

Nearly. The issue actually is that the format of the known cluster 
members file changed. But as with Mnesia, we support automatic upgrades 
for this file but not downgrades.

Yeah. I don't think in practice we have made such upgrades, but that's 
certainly an issue.

The bigger issue of course is that RabbitMQ 2.8.7 is going to have a 
difficult time knowing what changes have occurred after it was released. 
There could be an external tool written for downgrades I suppose. Not a 
high priority for us though.

High wip?

If you want to not lose non-persistent messages you'll have to keep the 
cluster up as you upgrade. Make sure all your queues are mirrored, wait 
for them to synchronise (or manually sync if that will take too long), 
take the first node down, perform the upgrade, bring it back up and let 
it rejoin the cluster, wait for sync again, repeat.

You really need to explain better what you are trying to achieve. Step 
back, forget about federation, and please describe the problem you are 
trying to solve.

Hmm. I'm not sure how well that would work; it's not something we have 
tested. I'm not sure whether the hostname of the machine(s) specified 
here get assumed to be part of the cluster.

The "federation: ..." exchanges and queues are federation 
*infrastructure* - they are not something a user/client is ever expected 
to interact with directly.

I think you are quite confused about how federation works. I'm not sure 
what to suggest as a way forward other than to read the documentation 
again, slowly.

In your example you have:

[{rabbit,
  [{cluster_nodes, {['rabbit at rabbit1', 'rabbit at rabbit2',
'rabbit at rabbit3'], disc}}]}].

What we do is just leave it like that and have a separate part of the
automated install which sets /etc/hosts to resolve those names.

Hi ,

I able to achieve my requirement .

Correct me if i am wrong , My understanding Fro federation -

* Federation use to federate any message between to broker over LAN, WAN
etc.

So i was trying Where i create upstream and upstream exchange with queue .
and when i publish any message to upstream exchange . it automatically
propagated to Down Stream Queue . 
Which i able to do .

Please correct me if my understanding is wrong on this .
This 2 link i went through -

But i still have one question -
as soon i create upstream  and Exchange which mach policy .
in another side it create one exchange with name 
*federation: user.Exdilip -> rabbit at Vxceed-PC B
type: x-federation-upstream*

And also one Queue 
*federation: user.Exdilip -> rabbit at Vxceed-PC*
With default Exchange binding . what is the use of this ?

As i m not seeing its any message coming to this queue .

As I said in my earlier message, the "federation: ..." exchanges and 
queues are part of the federation infrastructure, and not something a 
user/client should be interacting with directly.

Hi rabbitmq gurus

     I am a newbee  ... sorry.

     I have several producers (python-amqplib)  sending a total of half a million messages per day

     to my rabbitmq-server 3.1.15

     They all use topic.

     I have one consumer that sits there receiving a particular  topic   (275000 messages/daily)

     The connections for both the producers and the consumers are sustained... (connections are opened and are left

     that way unless someone  restarts one of them)

     Every runs smoothly for a while... 

     than  for no apparent reason,  my consumer is missing  some messages from one producer... 

     The producer still sends messages...   I simply restart the producer and the problem is resolved...

     Before restarting 

     netstat -an     tells me that the connections are established

     an so does

     rabbitmqctl list_connections

 

     Any Idea of the source of my problem ?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Shovel breaking: Was there a change in shovel
	config from 3.0.4 to 3.1.5?
Message-ID: <CAD6m6fGFY9TjM4_rse3J_0zBpMMbbKG5SCZr3QEpO6jE6p1gVA@mail.gmail.com>

I have the exact same configuration of shovel that i used in 3.0.4 and
tried to use it in 3.1.5 and I get syntax errors now.  Did something change
in 3.1.5?  Below is the config file I'm using that fails (this same config
file works perfectly fine on a 3.0.4 server).  I've looked at this and
looked at this, and can't see anything wrong or that doesn't match the
documentation.  As soon as I remove the shovel configuration section, the
server starts fine.  I get a crash message saying an invalid configuration
(4) before the .
Anyone see anything wrong?
Thanks!
Jason

Hmm. The config you posted looks OK to me (at least I was able to load 
it). What error message are you seeing?

The only change to the shovel in 3.1.x is support for failover in 
clusters - in older versions if you started multiple shovels with the 
same name on different nodes they would run simultaneously, now only one 
runs with another starting if the first one's node fails.

Cheers, Simon

Ah, scratch that. You upgraded Erlang at the same time, right? In R16B 
you're not allowed to use dots in atom names (as you do in your shovel 
names) without quoting them in ''. Actually I think you never were, but 
they tightened up the config parsing.

Cheers, Simon

Bingo putting the name in single quotes fixed my issues :). I'd say change the docs so that shovel names should include single quotes, or at least maybe mention invalid characters.  Thanks!!

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] [rabbitmq-c] amqp_queue_unbind eat a lot of
	memory in some usecases
Message-ID: <1378405957649-29384.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi there!

I have a following problem usecase:
1) Send a lot of message to some queue (I do it using java client)
2) Make connection to RabbitMQ using rabbitmq-c library and bind some
exchange to that queue
3) Call amqp_basic_consume method and start loop for reading messages from
the queue
4) After some time I try to make unbind... and this function eat a lot of
memory.
I think this function recive a lot of messages and save it to buffer until
it get unbind-ok.

I decided to solve this problem by calling basic.cancel befor making unbind,
but the behaviour was the same.

How can I solve this problem?
Is it possible to call cancel or unbind on another channel or it also will
accumulate all messages?
Or shoud I use another connection for it and will it work?

Best regards,
Yury

Hi Simon,

Upgrading to 3.1.5 seems to have made things better.  So either one of the
other bug fixes in 3.1.2 - 3.1.5 helped, or I was just unlucky those couple
of times we were trying it with 3.1.1. ;-)

Unfortunately I don't have the logs from those previous failed attempts.

Thanks for the response,
Chris

You are correct, this is likely what is going on inside the library.

Assuming you're not using the no-ack option of basic.consume, you could do
a basic.qos (amqp_basic_qos()) on the channel with the consumer, which will
limit the number of un-acked messages the broker sends to the client.

Calling it on a different channel won't help, the frame buffer is a
per-connection thing.

This is also an option.

According to the changelogs (http://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html) policy
based configuration of mirrored queues didn't come out until version 3.0.  I
believe before then the mirroring policy had to be declared when the queue
was created.  Eager synchronization (sync_queue) wasn't released until
version 3.1.0.

                     Thanks for the reply , but the mirroring option exists
while creating Queue from
management console -> Queue ->add queue - >type(durable/transient) -Node (
we can chose any node out of 3  ) - mirror (mirror across nodes , do not

Alan, thanks for your reply.

I set no-ack to 0 in basic.consume, so I suggest that server will wait for
basic.ack from client on each message. Or I have to set no-ack to 1 for this
behaviour?

Sync of queues after a failure wasn't released until 3.1.  Mirroring has been around a while but on a failure a node when rejoining the cluster comes on as a slave, assumes its message state is invalid and drops all persistent messages.  Please read the docs - this is very clearly stated in ha and clustering documentation.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Channel storms
Message-ID: <1378450216588-29395.post@n5.nabble.com>

We sometimes see node-amqp clients creating thousands and yet thousands of
channels, bringing a whole cluster to a halt. Normally we detect high
channel counts by polling the /api/connections endpoint, but when this
happens, the channels doesn't even belong to a connection, only if you can
poll /api/channels can you see all the channels (and when the CPU usage is
100% and you have 20000 channels this takes hours), but the connection is
then "unknown"/null. 

https://www.dropbox.com/s/e0koajldzxkuqlo/channelstorm.png

When the cluster is overloaded like that it responds to nothing, not even
rabbitmqctl status or rabbitmqctl delete_user, so a full cluster restart is
required and then we can block the misbehaving client. 

This shows up a lot in the logs when this is happening:

So the problem is two fold, the node-amqp lib obvisouly has a bug, I think
it doesn't closes channels after it self by default, but also, RabbitMQ
allows this kind of behavior and doesnt report the high channel count on
connections so we can't automatically detect it either :(

Yes, if no-ack is set to 0, the broker won't consider the message delivered
until you acknowledge it. By default the broker does not pause sending
messages if there are outstanding unacknowledged messages. You can tune
this by using basic.qos to set a message prefetch on the channel, this will
limit the number of unacknowledged messages on a channel before the broker
will pause and wait for the client to acknowledge a message.

If no-ack is set to 1, the broker considers the message acknowledged as
soon as it leaves the broker, and basic.qos will have no effect consumers
declared with this set.

You can acknowledge a single message with basic.ack (amqp_basic_ack()), or
all messages up to a message by setting the multiple flag when doing a
basic.ack.

OP: you may want to (re)read tutorial #2,

Hi,

I'm a backend engineer at Wingify [1] and we did some geo-distributed
architectural rework in past months which uses Redis, RabbitMQ and
Openresty/Lua which at present handles about peak 20 Billion requests/month
and average 11 Billion request/month.

I'm writing to the three communities of these opensource projects to thank
them for their good work and to share our work [2] as well as a general
purpose reusable component [3] we recently opensourced which moves data
from Redis to RabbitMQ and provides best of speed and reliability.

Alan, 
and if no-ack is false and prefetch_count set to 0 (as in my case)... What
does it mean?
Does it mean that server use default setting for prefetch and send
additional messages to client?

I think that if prefetch_count = 0 server must not push messages to me? Is
it correct?

See:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-errata.html#section_3

In short, the spec was changed at the very last minute before release, 
breaking existing implementations. Rather than break all the clients at 
that point we stuck with the existing meanings.

It's certainly unfortunate.

As a result we try to avoid using these types for headers we add to 
messages.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Issues with basic_consume method !
Message-ID: <1378384439126-29378.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,

Few time I've configured rabbitmq on multiple servers and also implemented
rmq clustering on them. Each server is responsible for consuming messages
from number of queues (there are multiple queues) by using basic_consume
method. Recently I've encountered one issue with basic_consume method, that
is when a server consumes all messages from a queue after that it waits/keep
listening to queue for more messages...But after sometime if new messages
arrives into that queue then server stops to consume those new messages and
this issue occurs very randomly (not always).

Is there anyway to know if the queue is empty or not ? so that we can
terminate script instead of waiting/listening for new messages in queue..and
can anyone please help me to figure out why this issue occurs with rmq
basic_consume method ?

Thanks,
Ding

Is your producer report any errors? Are there any errors or warnings in RabbitMQ log (if you have it,
please post it to the list).

Does it work better if you try Pika (a different Python client)?

Message-ID: <36b02eaf-d4f9-45af-af4c-b1a43165b394@googlegroups.com>

Hi,

I am hoping you can help me as no one on the Zenoss forum is.

I am learning a lot about RabbitMQ during this troubleshooting process! :-)

I setup a two node veritas cluster running Zenoss which uses rabbitmq. In 
my configuration, i believe RabbitMQ does not know it is a cluster.

The cluster consists of a SAN drive this is switches between nodes on 
failover. Each node had rabbitmq installed then I move the mnesia database 
to the SAN drive and implemented a rabbitmq-env.conf

 tail /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf
RABBITMQ_NODENAME=rabbit at localhost
RABBITMQ_MNESIA_BASE=/opt/zenoss/rabbitmq
RABBITMQ_MNESIA_DIR=/opt/zenoss/rabbitmq/mnesia/rabbit\@localhost

By making the rabbitmq nodename localhost, I did not think it would have a 
problem with the failover as both hosts are localhost and it does not seem 
like there is a problem.

RabbitMQ runs fine on both hosts and host B gets an error when the Zenoss 
servers tries to connect to rabbitmq

Seems like none of the nodes can connect to the statistics database. Is there a way to fix this? Please help!!!

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] How list exchanges managed by a given node ?
Message-ID: <5229A89B.6020900@gmail.com>

Hello,

We run a multi node RabbitMQ cluster for several years now, and to 
optimize bandwidth and CPU usage, we try to make producers and 
consumers use the same node (to avoid inter-node communication).

For this to work well, client connections, exchanges and queues must 
all be created on the same node (this drastically improve RabbitMQ 
performances).

The problem is that when we do maintenance operation, we don't know 
how to figure out which exchanges are "managed" by a given node 
(meaning on which node the exchange was created) : this is easy to 
do with queues, but we haven't found any clue to do this for exchange.

Any idea ?

Thanks a lot for your help

This seems to be excluding exception message. Can you past a shell snippet
that demonstrates how you run the script?

There's no way to do that for exchanges because exchanges live on all 
nodes; you don't need to think about which node they're on like with queues.

Declare a queue (for example, with passive = true) and find message and consumer count on the response (queue.declare-ok).

Can you provide a script that reproduces the problem, as well as rabbitmq report
for the node?

Can you explain how clients connect to the rabbit nodes? This warning means
that *client* closed TCP connection abruptly (before finishing amqp 0-9-1 connection
negotiation).

I would guess this would be the traditional problem with some connection 
dying / being disconnected by network infrastructure, and no heartbeats 
detecting it.

Ding: which RabbitMQ version and client are you riunning?

That's to be expected if the connection is not actually talking AMQP. 
You can suppress these warnings, see 'log_levels' at

So I assume the problem is that you don't think these connections should 
be listed, since you think they were short-lived not-really-AMQP 
connections from a monitoring tool?

Connections which have been closed (abruptly or not) should really not 
make it to this list. You might want to attempt to correlate the 
connection pid (e.g. "<0.470.0>" from the log above) with the results of 
"rabbitmqctl list_connections user peer_host peer_port pid state". If 
you see the same pid in both, that's a bug.

But actually I think those are real client connections that have somehow 
been routed to your host B, since the ones from zenoss should never have 
got as far as the 'running' state.

"rabbitmqctl list_connections user peer_host peer_port 
client_properties" might be illuminating - this will add a column 
listing the self-declared client properties to the output, only real 
AMQP clients will have such properties.

Cheers, Simon

I really don't think that's the case. Exchanges are routing logic that 
runs in the publishing channel process. The exchange, bindings and 
queues are looked up in Mnesia beforehand, but Mnesia distributes copies 
to all nodes so it's just a memory lookup. Then the exchange does some 
routing logic locally. That's it. Honest :-)

[NB: the above is true for the built-in exchange types, it's not 
impossible to write an exchange type where routing logic gets made in a 
single process somewhere. But we haven't done that.]

Hi, thanks for your answer, and I agree at a logical level.
Nevertheless, I'm afraid that performance wise, this is not so 
transparent: I experienced the following issue this morning:

Let say an exchange was created by a client connection made on node 
1 at a time. Then, a producer is connected on node 2 and a consumer 
is connected also on node 2 (with the  consumer's queue also on node 
2) then all the network traffic will follow this path:

producer -> node 2 -> node 1 -> node2 -> consumer

instead of

producer -> node 2 -> consumer

this have a big impact on network and CPU

Cheers,

The pid is effectively just a connection identifier in this case. So if 
the connections logging as "closed_abruptly" don't show up under 
"rabbitmqctl list_connections" I'd say you're good.

You don't need to make substitutions there - I mean literally 
"rabbitmqctl list_connections user peer_host peer_port client_properties 
pid". That command means "give me a listing with columns for user, peer 
host, etc". See 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/man/rabbitmqctl.1.man.html#list_connections for 
more details.

Afraid not.

OK, thanks for the reply. I understand your point: I'll do more 
investigations to figure out why my traffix is routed this way. 
Maybe I did something wrong.

By the way, we are running RabbitMQ 2.5.1, if this can make a 
difference.

Simon, thank you very much for your help!

Yes I figured that if my connection was closed those connections would not
listed

I actually killed the connections yesterday and they kept coming back under
different pids

I started the zenoss service that connects to rabbitmq and it looks like
its trying to connect to a PID that does not exist which it sounds like
from your e-mail that that is ok?

sorry I am running a little slow this morning but I couldn't get that
command to work all together but was able to just run it with pid option

rabbitmqctl list_connections zenoss localhost client_properties pid
Listing connections ...
Error: {bad_argument,zenoss}

I wish I knew more about how the client connects but there is not much

zenoss is a vhost name?

Then you want

rabbitmqctl list_connections -p zenoss localhost client_properties pid

You can run rabbitmq on port 5673 (or any other) and use a proxy tool [1]
that ships with the Java client.

Plus you can use Wireshark.

I still don't think I am 100% sure what you are saying your problem is. 
Are you saying:

1) Zenoss should be connecting to node A and node B to monitor them
2) It should also be routing connections from clients to node A but not 
node B since node A has not failed
3) But you're seeing long-lived connections to node B, which shouldn't 
be happening

That's what I've understood from you.

However, I've just Googled "zenoss rabbitmq" and they claim their plugin 
monitors RabbitMQ by invoking rabbitmqctl over ssh. So I don't think 
that adds up with what I've understood.

So please can you explain what you expect to be happening, and why the 
results you're seeing don't match your expectations?

Cheers, Simon

I get the same error when try to list plugins with rabbitmq-plugins.bat

It's happening in three machines completely differents running Windows 7

Also, i'm using rabbitmq-server-3.1.5 and Erlang R16B01.

Please, could anyone help?

Thanks!

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Producer consumer parameters
Message-ID: <CAN+AGk0ELk=zr-nASL9sXVX01ob4CYpA6sist0ZXez=Eh4TUxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I have a scenario where

Producer would keep sending message whether consumer is available or not,
the messages should be durable i.e. persistent unless consumer takes it
process its and gives acknowledgement. Any one producer or consumer may
connect to rabbit any time.

Should they share same exchange and queue?

What parameters should producer exchange/queue have?
What parameters should consume exchange/queue have?
Are there error handlings to be done?

or this should be more than enough to do the above

http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-two-python.html

Thanks,
Marutha

Consumers will need to share a queue to be delivered messages
that were published and routed before they came online.

> What parameters should producer exchange/queue have?

Messages will happily sit in a queue waiting for consumers regardless
of their durability but my guess is that you want durable queues and messages
published as persistent.

Consumers should not worry about how messages reached the queue so you can
publish any way you prefer (e.g. "directly to the queue" using default exchange).

> What parameters should consume exchange/queue have?

Since consumers will share a queue, they should not be exclusive, but that's about it.

> Are there error handlings to be done?

Can you be more specific? What failures do you want to handle?

Hi,
Is amqp-client 3.1.x backward compatible with rabbitmq 2.8.x? We needed to 
upgrade our spring-amqp library to the latest release but it has maven 
dependency to amqp-client 3.1.3. We don't want to upgrade our rabbitmq 
server at this time.

Thanks for your info,

Yes, it does. But why there is a attempt to write this erlang cookie there?
I didnt configure it, all config is default.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ Shovel Bug? (Version 2.8.4)
Message-ID: <201309072237256501753@edocom.cn>

Hi,

Today we encountered a strange issue when using RabbitMQ shovel plugin (Version 2.8.4). 


RabbitMQ sender  -> Source RabbitMQ server  -> RabbitMQ shovel -> Destination RabbitMQ server -> RabbitMQ receiver
192.168.1.10        192.168.1.10               192.168.1.11       192.168.1.12                   192.168.1.12

1: First we didn't start RabbitMQ receiver. The messages are stored in the "Destination RabbitMQ server".
2: Then we stop the RabbitMQ sender. And we start RabbitMQ receiver. At this time the consuming rate is around 500 messages per second.
3: Now we restart the RabbitMQ sender again. However, the RabbitMQ receiver can only consume around 130 messages per second.

So from our view, whether the messages keep coming into the "Destination RabbitMQ server" via shovel can affect the receiver's consuming rate greatly. 
We wonder if you guys have met such similar issues? Thanks a lot.




Best regards,
Johnson

Simon,

Anything else you can think of to troubleshoot more?

You are essential saying that Zenoss is at fault?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Ubuntu Charm Championship Contest
Message-ID: <CA+6NWttfiM8VGZJenKzat7-XSXDZrWt2ZiTr8ZWSSsCUCfmTrQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello RabbitMQ community!

I just wanted to let you know that we're running an infrastructure
competition in Ubuntu:

https://github.com/juju/charm-championship

We've got over $60k in prizes that we're giving out, and I wanted to
point out that we have a nice charm for Rabbit. A charm is a script
that deploys and manages a service:

https://jujucharms.com/charms/precise/rabbitmq-server

We're using this charm in production with our OpenStack deployment; so
we're confident that it's robust enough for people using Rabbit on
Ubuntu to give it a shot. We have over 130 services integrate with in
the Charm Store so I was thinking that if you're using Rabbit on
Ubuntu already and you're deploying it with other services then you
might want to investigate the contest and see if you want to earn some
money too. :)

The contest runs through 22 October, thanks!

 RabbitMQ service on Windows
Message-ID: <84304573-572d-44a5-954f-cd04d6a1bf6b@googlegroups.com>

I've got RabbitMQ running as a service on Windows.  When I enable the 
plugin and try restarting the server/service RabbitMQ won't start and the 
log file shows this:

=INFO REPORT==== 6-Sep-2013::17:54:18 ===

=INFO REPORT==== 6-Sep-2013::17:54:19 ===
Error description:

When I disable the plugin the server starts again just fine.  I've tried 
the rabbitmq-service.bat stop/install/start with no luck either.

How can I get the rabbitmq-jsonrpc-channel pluging working?

Thanks

Hi Simon,

I am not trying to monitor rabbitmq. Rabbitmq is part of the new version of
Zenoss.

I setup my new Zenoss installation in a Veritas cluster that has a SAN and
VIP that fail back and forth between the hosts.

Zenoss and RabbitMQ work fine on Node A but not on Node B. I don't see any
difference in the setup from Node A to Node B.

If this were working right, I could failover to Node B and RabbitMQ would
allow Zenhub (a zenoss service) to connect to it. Zenhub logs tell me
RabbitMQ is refusing its connection.

Thank you for any help!

Cheers

Hi Simon,

Thanks for your help. It is working now! I am not exactly sure what made it
work. A restart was one thing

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Broken Pipe in RabbitMQ
	ConnectionFactory.newConnection()
Message-ID: <7849de98-57e6-41dc-ac4a-8181d5279d60@googlegroups.com>

Rarely, when under more load than usual my RabbitMQ application starts 
returning SocketException: Broken pipe (and basically doesn't process any 
further messages).

The system is using the RPC pattern, with workers listening on a few 
predefined queues for jobs, clients submitting tasks on these jobs while 
opening a temporary auto-delete queues that they specify as replyTo queue 
where they listen for the replies on (and use a correlation ID as well to 
match the messages).

The code that actually leads to the Broken pipe is quite simple, it is in 
the client part and basically does:
    factory = new ConnectionFactory();
    factory.setUri(uri);
    connection = factory.newConnection(); // this is when we get the 
exception

The exception is as follows:
    2013-09-06 21:37:03,947 +0000 [http-bio-8080-exec-350] ERROR 
RabbitRpcClient:79  - IOException

    at 
com.rabbitmq.client.ConnectionFactory.newConnection(ConnectionFactory.java:533) 
    
        ...

I think this generally coincides with the workers taking longer than usual 
about their business, and thus more temporary client queues concurrently 
open (about 20-30 perhaps?), however as far as I know I'm not running into 
any of the usual watermarks (memory, disk - I could be running into some 
limit I don't know about).

I've reviewed the Rabbit logs and the only kind of errors I find there are:

    =ERROR REPORT==== 6-Sep-2013::21:36:59 ===
    closing AMQP connection <0.3105.1297> (10.118.69.132:42582 -> 
10.12.111.134:5672):
    {handshake_timeout,frame_header}

I checked both logs and the first "broken pipe" on the client appeared at 
21:37:03, while the first ERROR of any kind in RabbitMQ logs on that date 
appeared at 21:36:59, with regular errors of the same kind appearing 
regularly thereafter until the systems were restarted. Thus I believe the 
ones published are corresponding log entries. 

I'm using the Rabbit Java client 3.1.4 (latest on Maven central) with 
Rabbit server 3.1.4 running on Amazon Linux un AWS EC2.

Here is the rabbitmqctl status under normal situation (unfortunately not 
during the failure, I will try to get one when it appears next):

Any ideas what could be wrong or at least what I can do to debug this / get

John,

Can you post a snippet of your code that demonstrates what operations lead
[presumably] to this error? Is it possible that you are opening and closing connections
constantly or only creating and deleting reply queues?

What version of Rabbit and Windows do you run? Can you post what's in the SASL log?

Michael,

Actually I am opening and closing connections quite a lot (once every ~3
RPC requests on average). Is that bad and I'm supposed to pool them?

The client code is (split into multiple methods actually, but roughly):

            factory = new ConnectionFactory();
           connection = factory.newConnection();
    channel = connection.createChannel();

    Map<String, Object> arguments = new HashMap<String, Object>();
    arguments.put("x-expires", 10*60*1000); // 10 min
replyQueueName = channel.queueDeclare("", false, true, true,
arguments).getQueue();

    consumer = new QueueingConsumer(channel);
    channel.basicConsume(replyQueueName, true, consumer);

            String response = null;
    String corrId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

    BasicProperties props = new BasicProperties.Builder()

It is simply unnecessary and also really inefficient.

RabbitMQ's protocol assumes long lived connections.
I can imagine there are potential issues in connection shutdown code in some clients simply
because there typically is no good reason to constantly open and close them in "real world" code.

Consider using a long-lived connection first (one channel should be fine for RPC), and
if the issue does not go away, post a stack trace here.

Note that if you publish messages from multiple threads, each should use a separate channel
(connection sharing is fine).

But there shouldn't be. If so, there's a bug that I'd rather see fixed. 
I don't think there is though...

The OP's problem has all the hallmarks of the client, server, or network 
being overloaded. The "{handshake_timeout,frame_header}" in the logs 
indicates that the connection establishment handshake took longer than 
10 seconds. The reported connection.close hang is another indication. To 
the OP: it should not hang indefinitely; it would be good to find out 
how long it takes to return and what 'rabbitmqctl list_connections' says 
at the time.

> Consider using a long-lived connection

That's good advise. I also recommend re-using the temporary reply 
queues; creating one queue per rpc is really inefficient. And finally, 
get rid of the semi-busy loop in the consuming code. What's the point of 
calling nextDelivery with a 100ms timeout, when the code simply loops 
around on timeout?!

Oh, and another thing...

The code is setting an expiry on the published message. If that ever 
gets triggered, then no reply will be sent and the code becomes stuck 
going round the aforementioned consumer loop forever.

Regards,

Matthias.

I've raised a feature request to make durability and other settings

That's really a separate issue. I've filed a bug to address it. You can 
work around it by, say, linking the server process to the connection 
process.

What version of RabbitMQ are you running?

What errors were reported in the logs?

Restarting one of the nodes might help.

As was noted in the reply to your other email, manual (and automatic) 
mirror synchronisation was introduced in 3.1, so you'll need to upgrade.

There have been many performance improvements and bug fixes since 2.8.7. 
This is likely one of them. Please upgrade.

2.5.1 is ancient. You really should upgrade. However, the 
process/node-less nature of exchanges Simon explained hasn't changed; 
it's been like this since 1.0.0.

Ah, that's a bug, triggered when an exclusive queue is created, and 
during the process of creation the creating connection dies. We will get 
that fixed.

There's a minor bug here too, in that the above should be formatted in a 
more readable way. However, we actually fixed that in 3.1.2, so you 
really shouldn't be seeing that on a server running 3.1.5 (as reported 
in the management screenshot you posted). Was the above log message 
taken from a different server, running an older version?

On the server, channels can outlive connections for a while. The 
connections are dead; that's why you can't see the channels showing up 
in their counts.

Matthias.

Michael,
Matthias,

Actually I misclicked and sent the code without some comments (or other
code) that I should have added.

For the nextDelivery w/ 100 ms timeout and the expiration, after the
delivery = consumer.nextDelivery(100) line I am handling both sleeping a
bit in case of no delivery and timing out in case message is presumably
expired (in which case BTW a finally clause calls the connection.abort()) :


if (delivery == null) {
if (System.currentTimeMillis() - start < DEFAULT_TIMEOUT) {
Utils.sleep(200);
continue;
} else {
throw new IOException("Message delivery timed out on " + queueName + "/" +
replyQueueName);
}
}

I snipped it initially as irrelevant to the issue not to clutter up the
code, but now I see how I should have left it in.

In any case I've seen the error in my ways about creating new connections
for every request, I will start reusing connections (and maybe queues) and
see if that helps.

Thanks!

Regards,
John

OK? I found in AMQP 0-9-1 Complete Reference Guide that setting
prefetch-count  to zero meaning "no specific limit".
So I think that problem was in this parameter
p.s. Yep I set it to 1 and amqp_basic_unbind doesn't eat memory

Sorry, it seems I failed to attach it properly. I blame M$ technologies
(Outlook). Now I'm running a more decent e-mail client so the crash dump should

The erlang cookie gets written to the user's home directory. So if, as 
the error indicates, rabbitmq-plugins is trying to write the 
.erlang.cookie. to u:\, then u:\ is presumably set as the home dir.

If the queues are empty and the sender rate is 130 msg/s then the
average consumer rate will not exceed 130 msgs/s. Your description does
not preclude this possibility, though other explanations are possible.

Thanks. I added SERVER_START_ARGS="-kernel error_logger silent" to my /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf and restarted the service.
Now I see no logging in startup_log, and I presume that's the point. Let's see if this helps. I will let you know if there is another crash.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Prefetch count vs unack messages
Message-ID: <1378728333411-29461.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi there!

If I set some value to prefetch_count field (i.e. 20) and begin to get
message from server in
Web UI I see that I have 20 unack messages.
I understand that server push to client 20 messages... but if I stop client
(and didn't send basic.ack for that 20 messages) they disappeared from unack
column. Why?

Is it a correct behaviour and server anderstand that if client hasn't read
pushed messaged - he "take it back"?

Hello again - another crash on the server with the settings above:

=erl_crash_dump:0.2
Mon Sep  9 12:01:31 2013
Slogan: std_alloc: Cannot allocate 1121150602465920 bytes of memory (of type "arg_reg").
System version: Erlang R16B01 (erts-5.10.2) [source] [64-bit] [async-threads:30] [hipe] [kernel-poll:true]
Compiled: Sun Jul  7 05:35:15 2013
Taints:
Atoms: 27430
[..]

I can confirm that logging was disabled prior to the crash.
So next thing I need to do is log AMQP traffic?

Regards,

Oskar

Yes, if the channel in question is closed, all the unacknowledged 
messages are available for redelivery. They will also have their 
"redelivered" flag set.

I have forwarded the error message to the Erlang mailing list.
I'm doubtful that logging AMQP  traffic will lead to a solution. Let us
see if anyone on the Erlang mailing list has any better suggestions for
generating diagnostics.

Those are the standard messages logged when a RabbitMQ server is shut 
down. What do you think is the issue here?

Geoffrey,

This suggests a JSON RPC plugin dependency is not available.

How did you install RabbitMQ?

Hi Simon,

>> Those are the standard messages logged when a RabbitMQ server is shut

One node has been  taken out of the cluster (automatically) since those
messages appeared in the log file. Why RMQ got shutdown ? any idea ?

Thanks

Hey folks,

We (GoCardless) just open-sourced Hutch, an internal tool we've been using
for a while. In a nutshell, it enables simple inter-service communication
using RabbitMQ.

We wrote a blog post explaining the motivation behind it, and what it does
at a high level:
https://gocardless.com/blog/hutch-inter-service-communication-with-rabbitmq/

It's on GitHub at https://github.com/gocardless/hutch

Thoughts / comments / contributions all very welcome!

Yes, you're right, the screenshot was from another server, a server that
experienced another "channel storm" a couple of days before the last one. 

Ok, didn't know that channels could outlive connections, but that can
explain our problem, as we kill connections with too many channels. They
immediately reconnect and again starts thousands of channels, over and over
again, and the channels adds up as they outlive the connection. So a better
solution for us is to block new connections completely for a while instead
of just killing individual connections. 

Thanks!

No error on the producer/publisher side
No errors/warnings in  RabbitMQ log.

I have installed PIKA, and used their asynchronous consumer example
and so far (over the all the weekend) I wasn't able to reproduce the
problem...

This seems to point to my consumer...  will post something if it happens
again.

Thanks

Is your producer report any errors? Are there any errors or warnings in
RabbitMQ log (if you have it, please post it to the list).

Does it work better if you try Pika (a different Python client)?

Message-ID: <0B8CD6850421B745BE39BC5C760192327200BBB8@DDCEP50016.na.corp.mckesson.com>

Hello,

I would like to set the +Q parameter and it appears that I should use RABBITMQ_SERVER_ERL_ARGS parameter.

However, I'm not sure that this is an additive parameter to the Erlang Windows Service or an override.

My plan is to set the env parameter as +Q 65535, run rabbitmq-service stop; rabbitmq-service remove; rabbitmq-service install; rabbitmq-service start.

Looking at the rabbitmq-service.bat file on the install stage it appears that setting the RABBITMQ_SERVER_ERL_ARGS parameter would override the other parameters in the .bat file but wanted to confirm.

Cheers and thanks!

Problem, solved, guys! Thank you!

The problem was that %HOMEDRIVE% was pointing to U: instead of C: (I don't
know why, maybe a security issue implemented here in the company). So, to
solve I've done it:

SET HOMEDRIVE=C:
rabbitmq-plugins.bat enable rabbitmq_management
rabbitmq-service.bat stop
rabbitmq-service.bat install
rabbitmq-service.bat start

SET HOMEDRIVE=U: # Restore initial conditions after install plugin

Everything works ok now! Thank you!

HI,
I was able to complete http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html to tutorial-three-phython.html

When I tried using SendString and SingleGet .NET binaries, and rabbitmqctl.bat I net getting much luck.

Usage: SendString <uri> <exchange> <exchangetype> <routingkey> <message>

RabbitMQ .NET client version 3.1.5.0
Parameters:

or
c:\RabbitMQ.NetClient\bin>SendString "amqp://guest:guest at 127.0.0.1:5672" AMQP direct hello test123

But no message in the hello queue found.

Manually added message via Queue > hello > Publish message (and added messages using steps in tutorial-one-python.html)

Tried getting the message failed also:

How does Rabbit MQ prevent session replay attacks? Does it implement a
session management mechanism to manage active login sessions and to
prevent spoofing/masquerading?

Why don't you just subscribe to that queue with basic.consume, acks on, and
a prefetch of 1

When you get a message, reject it and cancel your consumer (if your logic
calls for it).

The message will be at the front of the queue.

Then spawn your 'consumer process'. The message (and any others) will be
there waiting.

I use python pika async to do this sort of thing. Event driven, no polling.

If speed is important, use the tornado adapter; if you are feeling lucky,
use the libev adapter (full disclosure: I wrote it)

Have you tried writing code similar to the python tutorial using the .NET client? Looking at https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/tree/master/dotnet might help, though that's probably very out of date.

> But no message in the hello queue found.

Well indeed - queues are not magically created for you, you've got to declare them either in your code or using one of the various management tools.

That's one way to do it.

> Tried getting the message failed also:

>  

The reason for the the failure is tucked away in the exception message here:

> text="PRECONDITION_FAILED - parameters for queue 'hello' in vhost '/' not equivalent"

Before singleget attempts to issue a basic.get, it declares the target queue - using queue.declare - to ensure it's present. This is fine, since queue.declare is idempotent - if the queue already exists, the declaration acts like an assertion, otherwise it creates the queue. As you can see below, the code in SingleGet that declares the queue makes very specific assumptions about parameters:

            using (IModel ch = conn.CreateModel()) {
                conn.AutoClose = true;

                ch.QueueDeclare(queueName, false, false, false, null);
                BasicGetResult result = ch.BasicGet(queueName, false);
                if (result == null) {
                    Console.WriteLine("No message available.");
                } else {
                    ch.BasicAck(result.DeliveryTag, false);
                    Console.WriteLine("Message:");
                    DebugUtil.DumpProperties(result, Console.Out, 0);
                }

                return 0;
            }

So at the time that queue.declare method is issued to the server, if the queue that you manually created on the server was configured with *different* parameters, the queue.declare method will fail and a channel error will be raised, invalidating the channel and throwing an exception in the client.

>

Make sure that the queue you're consuming via SingleGet was declared with exactly these same parameters. Alternatively, write you own code to consume messages from the queue, and ensure that when calling the channel's QueueDeclare method, you provide the same parameters that the queue was originally declared/created with.

Cheers,
Tim

Do you mean when using SSL or not? When using SSL, session replay 
attacks should not be possible for the usual SSLish reasons.

When using vanilla AMQP all bets are off - there's nothing in AMQP to 
prevent such attacks (and I think it would be a really bad idea to go in 
that direction, AMQP would end up growing an ad-hoc, 
informally-specified, bug-ridden implementation of half of Common 
Li^W^WSSL).

The RabbitMQ plugin page states the following however I can't get Internet
Explorer 9 to work.  Are older browsers truly magically enabled to work
with "websockets"?

SockJS is a WebSockets poly-fill that provides a WebSocket-like JavaScript
object in any browser. It will therefore work in older browsers that don't
have native WebSocket support, as well as in new browsers that are behind
WebSocket-unfriendly proxies.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Mochiweb / SSL failing to boot on esl-erlang
	R16B01
Message-ID: <522EE05E.2040203@lshift.net>

Hi there.

We're using Erlang Solutions' packages of erlang for ubuntu
(specifically1:16.b.1-1~ubuntu~precise) , and there seems to be some bad
interaction between this, mochiweb, and ssl, meaning that the ASN1
application (seemingly) doesn't get started on boot, and rabbit crashes
trying to start the mochiweb listeners (crash logs below).

The odd thing is, that with a version of R16B01 built from source with
kerl <https://github.com/spawngrid/kerl>, everything works perfectly
well. Also, we can work around this by adding ssl as an application
dependency to either the mochiweb .app or the rabbit .app descriptor
files. But we'd like to understand this better, and get the root issue
fixed.

I don't suppose that anyone could shed any light on this, perhaps?

Thanks.

Can you confirm which version of RabbitMQ you're using? There was 
definitely a bug in this area that was fixed in 3.1.2.

If you're using >= 3.1.2, are you using SSL *just* for mgmt? What 
happens if you enable it for AMQP as well?

Cheers, Simon

Note that you can achieve the same effect by setting ERL_MAX_PORTS on
current versions of Erlang.

The parameter is not used for anything else, so you can safely assign
any additional commandline parameters such as '+Q 65535'.

"rabbitmq-service remove" is actually redundant.

RABBITMQ_SERVER_ERL_ARGS won't override anything and is the correct
environment variable to use.

Note for people reading this in the future: ERL_MAX_PORTS is scheduled 
for removal in Erlang R17, so after that point you *must* use +Q in 
RABBITMQ_SERVER_ERL_ARGS.

Oops - I take that back. The .NET tutorials are in fact up to date! Sorry for any confusion.

We're using 3.1.3, as it happens.

Yes, we're using SSL solely for management at present. And indeed,
enabling a dummy amqp/ssl listener does mean that the rabbit doesn't
crash in the same way.

Ah, OK. Well that gives me something fairly clear to go on. Thanks for

So it turns out that this is fixed in the latest releases due to the 
upgrade we did to Mochiweb in RabbitMQ 3.1.4 (but 3.1.4 has an ugly bug 
so I suggest 3.1.5).

Oh, lovely. We were planning to upgrade anyway, but this just means
we'll do it sooner.

I was able to complete http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html to tutorial-three-phython.html

When I tried using SendString and SingleGet .NET binaries, and rabbitmqctl.bat I net getting much luck.

Have you tried writing code similar to the python tutorial using the .NET client? Looking at https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/tree/master/dotnet might help, though that's probably very out of date.

But no message in the hello queue found.

Well indeed - queues are not magically created for you, you've got to declare them either in your code or using one of the various management tools.



Manually added message via Queue > hello > Publish message (and added messages using steps in tutorial-one-python.html)


That's one way to do it.


Tried getting the message failed also:
c:\RabbitMQ.NetClient\bin>singleget "amqp://guest:guest at 127.0.0.1:5672/" hello


The reason for the the failure is tucked away in the exception message here:


text="PRECONDITION_FAILED - parameters for queue 'hello' in vhost '/' not equivalent"

Before singleget attempts to issue a basic.get, it declares the target queue - using queue.declare - to ensure it's present. This is fine, since queue.declare is idempotent - if the queue already exists, the declaration acts like an assertion, otherwise it creates the queue. As you can see below, the code in SingleGet that declares the queue makes very specific assumptions about parameters:

            using (IModel ch = conn.CreateModel()) {
                conn.AutoClose = true;

                ch.QueueDeclare(queueName, false, false, false, null);
                BasicGetResult result = ch.BasicGet(queueName, false);
                if (result == null) {
                    Console.WriteLine("No message available.");
                } else {
                    ch.BasicAck(result.DeliveryTag, false);
                    Console.WriteLine("Message:");
                    DebugUtil.DumpProperties(result, Console.Out, 0);
                }

                return 0;
            }

So at the time that queue.declare method is issued to the server, if the queue that you manually created on the server was configured with *different* parameters, the queue.declare method will fail and a channel error will be raised, invalidating the channel and throwing an exception in the client.



Please advise.

Make sure that the queue you're consuming via SingleGet was declared with exactly these same parameters. Alternatively, write you own code to consume messages from the queue, and ensure that when calling the channel's QueueDeclare method, you provide the same parameters that the queue was originally declared/created with.

Cheers,
Tim

Yes, thanks - that's exactly why I am attempting to use the
RABBITMQ_SERVER_ERL_ARGS

However, I find that the environment variable has no effect when
installing RabbitMQ/Erlang as a Windows Service.
If I modify the rabbitmq-service.bat install file to add the +Q parameter
it works. From examining the rabbitmq-service.bat file I don't see where
the RABBITMQ_SERVER_ERL_ARGS is actually referenced. Is this intentional?

Cheers,

You can check by inspecting the output of "rabbitmq-service list" after
running "rabbitmq-service install". You should then see the contents of
%RABBITMQ_SERVER_ERL_ARGS% amongst the other VM parameters.

Hi Folks,

I finished writing an adapter to PubNub which extends RabbitMQ to the web.  The idea is to extend your RabbitMQ deployment to non-AMQP clients on the web with minimal changes.  It allows you to have bi-directional communication between back-end servers and web clients without opening up any special ports or changing your RabbitMQ deployment, and without having to manage any client software or installables.

I put it on GitHub (https://github.com/pubnub/rabbitmq) so it is free and ready to use.  I started with tutorials 1 and 2 on the RabbitMQ site as a baseline and extended that example to show how the adapter can just drop right in.  There's also blog post that links to video tutorials so you can see it in action (bit.ly/13GQVyX ).

 I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback and see if this addresses real-world problems.

thanks,
randy

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Cluster node restart
Message-ID: <1378833950189-29504.post@n5.nabble.com>

Have a two node cluster, both were running 3.1.0, but I upgraded one of them
to 3.1.5, but when doing so the node2 didn't start up properly. I killed it
and started again, and again. I restart and upgrade node1 too, then started
node2 again, this shows up in the logs:  

https://gist.github.com/carlhoerberg/455aba31199b6481fc63

I restart node2 a couple of more times, it just hangs with
"msg_store_persistent: rebuilding indices from scratch" and no cpu or io
traffic. 

I restart node1 once again, and then node2 comes up quickly!

Why don't you just subscribe to that queue with basic.consume, acks on, and
a prefetch of 1

When you get a message, reject it and cancel your consumer (if your logic
calls for it).

The message will be at the front of the queue.

Then spawn your 'consumer process'. The message (and any others) will be
there waiting.

I use python pika async to do this sort of thing. Event driven, no polling.

If speed is important, use the tornado adapter; if you are feeling lucky,
use the libev adapter (full disclosure: I wrote it)

This is fine, since queue.declare is idempotent - if the queue already exists, the declaration acts like an assertion, otherwise it creates the queue.

Hi,
We have recently observed this pattern in our production cluster (rabbitmq
2.8.5).

Can you confirm the bug id being discussed in this thread, so that we can
verify that it is currently fixed in the latest release?

Thank you very much,
Carlos

Which version was node2 running? We are not 100% sure of the cause of 
the stack trace there, but we hope that it's a consequence of bug 25638 
(fixed in 3.1.4). So to know either way would be useful.

The (related) bug number is 25215. That was fixed in 3.0.0, before we 
started adding bug numbers to release notes.

This is one of those cases where we never got 100% to the bottom of it, 
but we eliminated some suspicious-looking code and we haven't seen a 
report of the issue on 3.0.0 or later. So I can't promise it's gone, but 
it's looking quite likely.

Cheers, Simon

Please advise! 
I'm using RabbitMQ with elasticsearch server. I have an multithread
application that's publishes messages to RabbitMQ. It wakes up one
connection and for example three channels. 

What's will be faster or better: publish one big message near 500-600
documents per thread, or publish 4-5 more smaller messages, near 100-150
documents per thread 

Thanks.

In general, all else being equal, fewer larger messages is likely to be 
faster (since you hit the routing logic less frequently).

The standard advice in this situation is to do your own performance 
tests though. The Java client ships with a performance testing tool, try 
downloading it and invoking:

$ runjava.sh com.rabbitmq.examples.MulticastMain --help

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Problem when enqueuing with no delay
Message-ID: <52303798.4030903@ific.uv.es>

Hi all,

I'm testing RabbitMQ AMQP with amqp-ruby library client. The scenario is 
1 or 2 producers sending little messages from about 50 KB to one queue 
(the idea is increase this amount of KB)  and various consumers.

The problem comes when there's no delay when producer is enqueuing 
messages, this is the basic code (where variable /productor_time/ is the 
time between enqueuing messages):

[...]
               EventMachine.add_periodic_timer( productor_time ) do
                     exchange.publish message, :routing_key => "queue0", 
:persistent => (true)
                     progress(1)
              end
[...]

When /productor_time/ is 0, it seems that there is a collapse in a 
moment, and publishers are enqueuing messages but consumers don't 
dequeue message and so the RAM memory and SWAP memory increase to the 
crash of the machine. If /productor_time/ is more than 0, for example 
0.1, there's no problem and consumers dequeue messages normally.


The code for consumer:

            queue.subscribe(:ack => true) do |header, message|
                 messages << message
                 header.ack
                 progress(1)
            end


If I try with ruby-STOMP interface this problem is not present.

Do you know what is happening here?

Thanks

Cheers,

Pablo

When you flood publish (interval of 0 is basically an infinite loop), you need to make sure your consumers can keep up with producers.

What RabbitMQ version are you using? Any reasonably recent version will block publishers
when a node crosses RAM high watermark (or disk space). There will be clear messages
about it in the log.

The entire machine or just one process? Which process is that, your Ruby app or RabbitMQ node?

Hi Michael,

I'm using RabbitMQ 3.1.3.

The Ruby app process makes the crash of the machine as it increases the 
RAM and SWAP memory very fast to the limit.

I can't see any clear messages in log about it. I setted high watermark 
with:

sudo rabbitmqctl set_vm_memory_high_watermark 0.9


Thanks,

Pablo

That's expected. With periodic timer set to 0, you have an infinite loop in your app that allocates
memory (first when you publish, then when a message is delivered). CRuby VM will *not*
release memory once it's allocated (only reuse it after GC marks it as free). With an infinite
loop, you allocate faster than GC kicks in and does its work, so at some point OS starts
swapping, and then you run out of memory.

Why do you need to publish messages in a tight loop?

Well, if the Ruby app crashes, RabbitMQ does not know anything about it.

Hi again,

We are publishing messages in this tight loop just for testing purposes 
and simulate scenarios with several publishers per second.

But I don't understand why this problem is happening with the ampq 
interface, but with stomp interface and the same loop, it doesn't occur:

  while true do
                     client.publish "queue0", 
message,{'amq-msg-type'=>'text', 'type'=>'content',:persistent => true)}
                     progress(1)
                     sleep(0.000000000001)
end


Maybe the stomp interface works in another way different to the amqp one 
(with eventmachine, etc.)

Cheers,

Pablo

This is not the same as periodic timer with period = 0. You still sleep, no matter for how
tiny a period.

Profiling memory usage will tell but I doubt many use EventMachine timers with period = 0,
so there can potentially be issues there, too.

One thing that's still not clear is whether you consume messages in the same process with both
AMQP 0-9-1 and STOMP?

Also, if you are not happy with EventMachine or don't use it already, I highly recommend using
Bunny [1] on CRuby and March Hare [2] (previously HotBunnies) on JRuby.

1. http://rubybunny.info
2. http://hotbunnies.info

Thanks for the bug report.

So it looks what is happening is a queue is in the process of being 
deleted while the vhost that contains it is also being deleted. I assume 
you have a user who is busy churning queues while you delete their user 
/ vhost?

At the moment that doesn't appear to be safe. We'll fix this in a future 
release, but for the time being you can work around this with something 
like:

* Remove user permissions to vhosts
* (Remove user if that's what you want to do)
* Kill all connections to the vhost
* Delete the vhost

Cheers, Simon

Yes, deleting the user before the vhost was enough. Thanks :)

More details about message leaking

My publishers all open one connection, uses 1 channel and declare and
feed the same exchange (exchange with auto-delete = true)

When I start the publishers the exchange is created and receives
(publish-in) messages.

Than running my consumer :
it opens one connection, uses 1 channel, creates a queue
(auto-delete=true) and declare the same exchange (auto-delete=true)
 and bind the exchange  to its queue
everything runs smoothly.

When I stop my consumer the exchange is deleted in the rabbitmq server
(rabbitmq-management shows that)
even if the publishers are still feeding ???   Is this normal ?

Restarting the consumer, the exchange is "recreated"  but it seems that
some (or sometimes all) the bindings with the publishers
are broken ???

This is how I am losing messages

Rabbitmq 3.1.5 


What do I do wrong ?

No error on the producer/publisher side
No errors/warnings in  RabbitMQ log.

I have installed PIKA, and used their asynchronous consumer example and
so far (over the all the weekend) I wasn't able to reproduce the
problem...

This seems to point to my consumer...  will post something if it happens

Is your producer report any errors? Are there any errors or warnings in
RabbitMQ log (if you have it, please post it to the list).

Does it work better if you try Pika (a different Python client)?

If you declare a queue as auto-delete, it will delete itself when the 
last consumer disconnects.

If you declare an exchange as auto-delete, it will delete itself when 
the last queue unbinds (possibly as the result of a queue 
auto-deleting). Even if publishers are publishing to it!

Publishers which are publishing at that point will have their channels 
closed for publishing to an exchange which does not exist. If you have 
some retry logic in your publisher client you might then find that the 
publishers are reconnecting and redeclaring everything.

You probably want to stop declaring your exchanges (at least) as 
auto-delete. I doubt it's helping and it sounds like it's causing 
significant problems. In general auto-delete exchanges are a rare thing 
to want to use (they are mostly useful with internal exchanges and 
exchange to exchange bindings).

You might also want to turn on publisher confirms. See 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/confirms.html and 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/reliability.html

Cheers, Simon

I assume you use use auto-delete queues as well, so when your consumer goes away,
the queue is deleted, so is the binding, and you *auto-delete* exchange goes away as well,
regardless of whether there are attempts to publish messages to that exchange.

If the exchange was deleted, how can the bindings be around?

Sounds like you want an non-auto-delete exchange. Queues can be auto-deleted
if you really need them to be, however, if there are no queues bound to an exchange, attempts
to publish a message there will result in messages going nowhere by default.

You can publish with mandatory = true or use AE extension [1], or make queues stick around.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ 'hang' when trying to access HA queues
Message-ID: <8D76E9325134094DA4CFA89A132A4D640270D511BF@SPR3V9.office.local>

Hello,

We have been using RabbitMQ in a high volume application for about two years. We use queues which are durable and mirrored to both nodes in the cluster. We have done a great many load tests and failure tests successfully.

Last week, during a very important test, under very low load conditions, suddenly, two queues 'hung'. Attempts to view the queues via rabbitmqctl resulted in the rabbitmqctl command hanging. Our Java clients called queue declare to check the length of the affected queues but these calls hung (until timed out by application code). We know that publishers were attempting to send messages to the exchange which routed to the affected queues and we had consumers which appeared to be attached to the queues in question but no messages flowed through the system. Eventually the support team started bouncing RabbitMQ brokers, producers and consumers and the messages which had failed to materialise during the 'hang' suddenly appeared in our application. The rabbitmqctl list queues command and queue declare also started working.

During this extended period there were other queues in the broker which were working without issue. Cluster status reported that both nodes of the RabbitMQ cluster were running. We could confirm that memory usage was not higher than the 40% watermark during the outage.

Since memory usage looked normal and producers and consumers not associated with the two failing HA queues we discounted the rudimentary flow control in place at 2.7.1.

Our RabbitMQ broker is version 2.7.1 and is running on Solaris.

We are painfully aware that version 2.7.1 is woefully out of date and that there has been an enormous number of fixes and enhancements applied to HA queues since.

What we are hoping is that somebody could give us any indication of what could cause this issue. In an ideal world, somebody would report that this is a known issue with 2.7.1 and that the issue is resolved at a later release.

Any help much appreciated.

Andrew.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Getting SocketTimeoutException on java Producer
 client during load testing
Message-ID: <c4b4a15f-fffc-485c-9990-9f05864a088c@googlegroups.com>

I am getting the following "caused by" stack on an IO Exception occuring in 
my send method on the basicPublish call.

Caused by: com.rabbitmq.client.ShutdownSignalException: connection error; 
reason: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Timeout during Connection

com.rabbitmq.client.impl.AMQConnection$MainLoop.run(AMQConnection.java:541)

My belief at this point is that my producer load has overrun the connection 
factory pool in writing to the queues.

I have been unable to locate information on settings related to the 
connection factory pool to make it larger or change the timeout.  When the 
connections do timeout, it doesn't look like the pool catches up unless I 
kill the Producer application.  Anyone have advice on how to get past this 
issue? Is there a way to throttle the load at the Producer connection, or 
will it be necessary to just add more nodes to handle the incoming load?

I have not implemented "confirms" yet, because it seems that will only 
provide a way to solve message loss, not prevent connection failure under 
load. Am I wrong on this?

Thanks in advance for your help.

ConnectionFactory does not pool connections. Can you take a look at rabbitmq log to see if
there are any warnings about alarms and blocked publishers?

> Is there a way to throttle the load at the Producer connection, or will it be necessary to just add more nodes to handle the incoming load?

You can implement throttling logic in your own code but in general, you need to have enough
consumer capacity to keep up with producers, or RabbitMQ will block connections that publish
(there will be a very visible warning in the log).

On my last test attempt, this is what I received in the rabbitmq log

=WARNING REPORT==== 11-Sep-2013::16:02:40 ===
file descriptor limit alarm set.

********************************************************************
*** New connections will not be accepted until this alarm clears ***
********************************************************************


After running 2 separate loads with only 1 thread driving the load, 500
msgs ran on the producer and 500 were consumed. on the second, only 230
ran... totalling 730 which gets close to the default connection limit.
Apparently I'm doing something wrong with my Producer connections.

I've set the FD limit on the linux server to something abnormally high
(1024000), so it shouldn't be the OS causing the problem.

And just to close the loop.... problem is solved now. I was creating a new
connection for each sent message and not closing it.  The proper way to do
it is to create one shared connection and open new channels on that
connection for each send. The thing to remember is to close the connections
on client reset.

Thanks for your help!

Hm... I'd removed haproxy, set up and Vbox machine. Install there RMQ. In my
simple c# application I'm connecting directly to RMQ server. I set
RequestedHeartbeat of ConnectionFactory to 10 (means 10 seconds as I
understand). Run my application, set breakpoint after creating connection
and channel. After 10 seconds connectin dropped and in the RMQ logs I saw
like:
{heartbeat_timeout,running}
Also in debug I see that property IsOpen of IConnection object is set to
true, but channel is closed.

When I remove requestedHeardbeat parameter looks like fine, connection
didn't dropped...

Please advise: does current release of c# binaries are properly support
heartbeats? Does anyone have the same problem or maybe I made a mistake?

March Hare (n?e HotBunnies) 2.0.0.rc1 is released [1].
With this version the project changes name from Hot Bunnies
(which has a sexist meaning, chosen unintentionally) to March Hare.

RC1 is ready for developers to start migrating to it while we review and extend
doc guides. Note that there are some breaking public API changes.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] rabbitmqctl doesn't see the cluster?
Message-ID: <0B8CD6850421B745BE39BC5C760192327200FEEF@DDCEP50016.na.corp.mckesson.com>

Hello,

I have a 5 node cluster running on Windows Server 2008R2.
Each RabbitMQ node is Rabbit 3.1.5 and Erlang 16B01.

I am able to view the cluster status via the management console web page. However, I am unable to use the rabbitmqctl command to interact with the cluster. It appears to be unaware of the cluster:

E:\RabbitMQ\rabbitmq_server-3.1.5\sbin>rabbitmqctl cluster_status
Cluster status of node rabbit at SJINRMQ01 ...
Error: unable to connect to node rabbit at SJINRMQ01: nodedown

DIAGNOSTICS
===========

nodes in question: [rabbit at SJINRMQ01]

hosts, their running nodes and ports:
- SJINRMQ01: [{rabbit,50053},{rabbitmqctl879846,54351}]

current node details:
- node name: rabbitmqctl879846 at SJINRMQ01
- home dir: C:\Users\rcordell
- cookie hash: EF9tEYwcgt+6eQWnKm4y2A==


E:\RabbitMQ\rabbitmq_server-3.1.5\sbin>

I am running as an Administrator on the local machine, and running the command shell in Administrator mode. I know I must be missing something quite simple but haven't determined what it might be.

Any ideas?

Thanks!

Ron

Nevermind ? I should've searched for the log error.

The Erlang cookie file in my local user dir doesn't match ? I'll correct that.

Apologies for the noise.

Hi,
If you are trying to cluster two nodes, consider following processes:

1. run rabbit at devserver
2. run rabbit at devagent

At node devagent,
3.1 $ rabbitmqctl stop_app
3.2 $ rabbitmqctl join_cluster rabbit at devserver
3.3 $ rabbitmqctl start_app

4. check clustering : rabbitmqctl cluster_status

Hope this help.

My tests show that, when using c# client, idle connections are dropped after
30 minutes.

Today I started a new connection and channel. Wait near 15 minutes, then I
had published a message, and later on 30 minutes connection was dropped.
When I'm using java client connection is idle for example 2 days and don't
dropped.

Please advise.

This is not possible. If you need greater control then your options are
to implement a custom binding or to use the .net client library directly.

This is a very generic error which can indicate a broad range of issues.

What's in RabbitMQ log? Can you include the code that sets up trust manager and
keychain? Have you seen instructions on http://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html
about adding CA certificates using keytool?

Any activity on a connection counts for a heart beat. Can you post a snippet of code
that creates connection factory and a connection?

Both the Java and .net client default to 600s heartbeat intervals, i.e. 
10 minutes. Please confirm that by checking the output of 'rabbitmqctl 
list_connections name timeout client_properties'. The timeout value 
indicates the negotiated heartbeat interval.

Also, did you run both the c# and java test from the same machine?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Strange behaviour of RabbitMQ or client when
 network problems occurs
Message-ID: <1378979267460-29553.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi there!

I have a program that receive messages from RabbitMQ. The program loop is
like below:

init();
basic.consume();

while (1) {
  msg = read_message();
  if (!msg) {
     deinit();
    amqp_delete_connection (...);    // (1)
     sleep(5);
     init();
   }

  int res = process_message();
  if(res) {
   if (amqp_basic_ack(..) < 0) {
     deinit();
    amqp_delete_connection (...);     // (2)
     sleep(5);
     init();
    }
  }
}


In our test we send 100 messages to server after that starts our program and
sometimes make network problems (by firewall REJECT).
And in result we get 11 duplicated messages and only to times we were in
point (2), where
we couldn't send ack.
I can't understand where from 9 duplicated messages come? 

And one more question:
I use prefetch count = 20, for example if we processed 5 messages and after
that network problem occured why the next received message is 25? I thought
that if we close connection and don't send ack messages should stay in
previous order.

"new ssl" coexisted with "old ssl" until R15B (late 2011), after which the old implementation
was dropped. So the ssl application listed is "new ssl".

So, are you getting 11 or 9 redeliveries?

All unacknowledged messages will be requeued when the channel closes.
Looks like your way of creating network interference causes TCP connection
to be closed, which in turn makes RabbitMQ consider all your channels closed.

With prefetch = 20, if 9 messages were acked and then connection terminated,
you will get exactly 11 redeliveries after you reconnect and re-register your consumer(s).

The message "Halting Erlang VM" will only ever be logged in response to 
"rabbitmqctl stop" (or something that invokes that like 
"/etc/init.d/rabbitmq-server stop"), or when requesting to stop the 
Windows service. It is not something that will be logged when the Erlang 
VM shuts down for any other reason.

So something outside of RabbitMQ told it to shut down.

"queues hang" is not the signature of any bug we've fixed since 2.7.1. 
However, it is unlikely that you have stumbled on a new problem. Odds 
are that whatever causes the hang is no longer present in the most 
recent rabbit releases.

Thanks for your posts.

>>Any activity on a connection counts for a heart beat. Can you post a
snippet of code 
>>that creates connection factory and a connection? 

Sure, 
C#:
var connectionFactory = new ConnectionFactory { Uri =
"amqp://guest:guest at 10.112.1.250:5672/%2F" };
var conn = connectionFactory.CreateConnection();
var channel = conn.CreateModel();

... // << Breakpoint here, wait 30 mins - connection is dropped

Java:
public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
        ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ConnectionFactory();
       
connectionFactory.setUri("amqp://guest:guest at 10.112.1.250:5672/%2F");

        Connection connection = connectionFactory.newConnection();
        Channel channel = connection.createChannel();

        String k = "gfdgdgdf"; // << Breakpoint here, wait 30 mins -
connection is dropped
    } catch (Exception e){
        logger.warn(e);
    }
    System.exit(0);
}

If I set up a requestedHeartbeat, for example, 10, after 10 seconds
connection is dropped. This is Windows machine on both clients.
Also I'm using also rabbitmq-river for elasticsearch. Client is 3.1.1 there.
It runs from Ubuntu machine and connection idle for 2 days and don't
dropped.

Source there:

Thanks

Please set RequestedHeartbeat here.

Our hypothesis is that when you breakpoint a C# client, the entire VM is paused
and so heartbeat sender does not send anything out. With ElasticSearch RabbitMQ
river, no breakpoints are involved, so heartbeat sender is able to do its job.

Hi,

You asked:

> Was there anything unusual in the logs?

No. This was what was most disconcerting about this issue. We have done many many hours of testing under very high loads with multiple failure scenarios and whenever there has been an issue there has always been something in the log files which gave some indication of the problem. In this case the only entries we could see in the log files were the aborted connection reports from rabbitmqctl (I assume when it was cancelled by the operator).

>"queues hang" is not the signature of any bug we've fixed since 2.7.1. 
> However, it is unlikely that you have stumbled on a new problem. Odds are that whatever causes the hang is no longer present in the most recent rabbit releases.

It's a shame that this issue was not explicitly resolved since 2.7.1 as it would have eased the minds of the various parties involved in the investigation. Would it be correct to say that since 2.7.1 there has been major rewrites of the HA queue implementation and given the strong advice for users to upgrade to 2.8 and beyond, it is probable there were very few people using 2.7.1 in HA mode so a defect might have remain undiscovered? I appreciate this sort of question is impossible to answer without a significant amount of conjecture so any answer would be based on 'gut feeling'. 

Regards, Andrew.

"queues hang" is not the signature of any bug we've fixed since 2.7.1. 
However, it is unlikely that you have stumbled on a new problem. Odds are that whatever causes the hang is no longer present in the most recent rabbit releases.

Hmm. Quite.

It's not been rewritten as such, but has undergone substantial change
and improvement. There have been nearly 40 bug fixes to mirrored queues
since 2.7.1.

Michael,
the problem is that I receive some messages on that I send basic.ack by
calling amqp_basic_ack method again.

amqp_basic_ack return 0, but messages redelivered to me.

And why order of messages is mixed after that?

It's really hard to tell from your description what exactly you are doing.

I suggest you run your tests through the RabbitMQ protocol tracer 
(http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#tracer) and inspect the output. 
If things are still not clear after that then please submit the tracer 
output.

As per http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-python.html:

"The AMQP protocol predefines a set of 14 properties that go with a message. Most of the properties are rarely used, with the exception of the following:

delivery_mode: Marks a message as persistent (with a value of 2) or transient (any other value). You may remember this property from the second tutorial.
content_type: Used to describe the mime-type of the encoding. For example for the often used JSON encoding it is a good practice to set this property to: application/json.
reply_to: Commonly used to name a callback queue."

So you can specify the name of a reply queue in the basic.properties attached to a message, and use that to send a reply if necessary.

The problem is that amqp_basic_ack doesn't return error, but 
server does't receive it. Below you can find trace sampled by WireShark:

As a result we don't go to point (2) and this error catch only on processing

It's an asynchronous method, so won't return an error.

Matthias,
so I can't guarantee that if I send basic_ack I won't send it again?
And duplicated messages I have to throw out on application level?

Or did you mean to ask about `rabbitmqctl rotate_logs {suffix}' rather than parameters in general? It'd help if the question was a bit clearer. ;)

There's no 'ack' for an 'ack', so indeed you generally cannot guarantee 
that the server has seen an ack. There are ways around that, e.g. you 
could put the channel in transactional mode, in which case the commit-ok 
response serves an 'ack for the ack'. But that seriously impacts 
performance and doesn't address the broader issue of dealing with 
duplicates (which are unavoidable).

> And duplicated messages I have to throw out on application level?

Yes. I'm assuming you've read http://www.rabbitmq.com/reliability.html

Hi rabbitmq gurus

  In our environment, there is a probability that 
  a portion of our outside consumers  will "come and go away after a
while" ...

  Except for the rabbitmq-management plugin, there is no rabbitmqctl
command to
  delete a queue... is this right !?

  So the only way to delete an unwanted queue will be to code something 
  using the administrator user that will delete a queue using its
name... is that right !? 
  It is possible using PIKA ?

More details about message leaking

My publishers all open one connection, uses 1 channel and declare and
feed the same exchange (exchange with auto-delete = true)

When I start the publishers the exchange is created and receives
(publish-in) messages.

Than running my consumer :
it opens one connection, uses 1 channel, creates a queue
(auto-delete=true) and declare the same exchange (auto-delete=true)  and
bind the exchange  to its queue everything runs smoothly.

When I stop my consumer the exchange is deleted in the rabbitmq server
(rabbitmq-management shows that)
even if the publishers are still feeding ???   Is this normal ?

Restarting the consumer, the exchange is "recreated"  but it seems that
some (or sometimes all) the bindings with the publishers are broken ???

This is how I am losing messages

Rabbitmq 3.1.5 


What do I do wrong ?

No error on the producer/publisher side

I have installed PIKA, and used their asynchronous consumer example and
so far (over the all the weekend) I wasn't able to reproduce the
problem...

This seems to point to my consumer...  will post something if it happens

Is your producer report any errors? Are there any errors or warnings in
RabbitMQ log (if you have it, please post it to the list).

Does it work better if you try Pika (a different Python client)?

You might find that queue expiry is what you want. See

Hi Matthias,

Suchak and I got together and came up with a set of questions regarding our issue which if you were able to give feedback on, would be most useful.

We cannot be sure that during our 'hang' that publishers were blocked but from application behaviour, it seems likely, or at least they did not receive confirms. We do know that calls to queue declare (via the Java client) and rabbitmqctl list_queues both failed to return.

Our questions are:

- Are there any known conditions that you are aware of that would cause list_queues or declare queue to hang? If you are only able to indicate possible areas of the system that cause issue that would be helpful, e.g. if the MNESIA tables holding the queue metadata failed in some way (due to an infrastructure issue at the networking or disk level), could that explain one queue 'hanging'?
- The current documentation for RabbitMQ 3.x describes many situations where flow control kicks and publishers are blocked. We understand that flow control at 2.7.1 is rudimentary but it would simply involve publishers blocking (on basic publish) but could it in any way explain what we saw? (We are guessing not but wanted somebody who knows to confirm!).
- Some of our RabbitMQ clients are written in erlang and are embedded (with a significant amount of other application code) within the same cluster as RabbitMQ. Are there issues with this approach at 2.7.1?
- We are running the broker (and collocated application code) on Erlang R15B (erts-5.9) on Solaris SPARC. Again, are there any known issues with this configuration?

Thanks again for any support you can give us on this issue, I am aware you are going above and beyond the usual level of support especially given the version of RabbitMQ in use.

Regards, Andrew.

Hmm. Quite.

It's not been rewritten as such, but has undergone substantial change and improvement. There have been nearly 40 bug fixes to mirrored queues since 2.7.1.

Correct.

Message-ID: <DUB109-W99143A4AB7C78ED00553A19E3A0@phx.gbl>




Versions
Erlang R16B01RabbitMQ 3.1.5

I've recently tried to install the above versions of RabbitMQ and Erlang after previously uninstalling an older version. But I can no longer get RabbitMQ to install as a windows service. When I run rabbitmq-service install it says the service is already installed and raises "The Handle is invalid" error. When I call rabbitmq-service start it fails to start the service and raises "The handle is invalid" again. I've also tried running as an application using rabbitmq-server -detached but I get a "Failed to create cookie file". I found the following thread http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2011-July/014217.html and realised I may have got myself into this mess by not following the correct uninstall procedure but I can't figure out how to sort it out. I've tried all the things mentioned in this thread but still no joy. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

You can also try
http://markmail.org/message/agweq7n6kigmchjp
http://markmail.org/message/ans32vsylbqu4dco
http://markmail.org/message/donppftsqvokjn2j

The solutions that works for others is to completely remove the broker,
Erlang and all registry keys associated with the service before
re-installing.

The fact that you don't see confirms, and declare and list_queue hangs 
all point to one thing: That the Erlang process for the queue (master, 
in case of mirrored queues) has gotten stuck.

Since you are not seeing any errors, the queue process is likely waiting
for some task to complete.

No, since that flow control - both old and new - wouldn't affect
list_queues. Besides, you'd know that flow control is happening
by the 'blocked' state of the connection in list_connections.

There shouldn't be any issue as long as these clients and associated
application code are "well behaved". Since you are sharing a VM with
rabbit, there is of course the potential for one to affect the other.
And the sort of embedding, at that scale, as you describe above is
somewhat off the well-trodden path. Still, I struggle to see how even a
mis-behaved embedded Erlang client / app could cause the symptoms you
describe.

R15B is quite ancient, so definitely recommend upgrading that. But, 
again, it's very unlikely that this is the source of your problem.

Matthias.

Well, 
https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client#supported-transports-by-browser-html-served-from-http-or-https 
says that IE9 works. It is possible that the sockjs version in rabbit is 
too old, but your best bet is to report the problem to the sockjs 
developers.

You can get the # of consumers from queue.declare-ok (response to
queue.declare).

Exchanges don't have consumers, queues do. See

for more info.

My user is in all groups.

I am able to see all the queues from the Management Plugin.
However, I am not able to list queues from the rabbitmqctl command:

E:\RabbitMQ\rabbitmq_server-3.1.5\sbin>


No output appears and I have to kill the command. Examining the rabbitmq log, I see the following:


=ERROR REPORT==== 12-Sep-2013::11:54:22 ===
webmachine error: path="/api/queues"
"Unauthorized"

=ERROR REPORT==== 12-Sep-2013::11:54:42 ===

"Unauthorized"



I'm not sure what's happening here and why I am unable to list the queues from a particular vHost.

Cheers,

Ron

Hi guru

 

   In pika,  my consumer generates a queue with a rabbitmq autogenerated
name...

   Everything works fine.

   I start my consumer and restarts it specifying for queue name the
autogenerated name

   and I get that error

     Can't it  redeclare/bind with that name  to resume my message
delivery ?

     My consumer user permissions are     ".*"   "^amq.gen.*$"  ".*"

if you can't get SockJS to work on IE9, you can try my adapter instead.  i just published it on github and it connects RabbitMQ to web and mobile clients.  there's a tutorial and code samples on this blog post:
http://www.pubnub.com/blog/extend-rabbitmq-into-mobile-and-web-using-pubnub/

the adapter works as an AMQP client to consume/produce with RabbitMQ and it works as a web client to publish/subscribe to the PubNub network.  then the PubNub network connects to any mobile/web clients on the appropriate channel.

On the browser side, you can just use PubNub's simple api to publish/subscribe.

Applications cannot declare entities that start with amq.

Server-named queues are supposed to be used (and declared) only by consumers. It makes
no sense to use them if you share the name between multiple services. In that case, use
well known names that do not start with amq.

If you really need to share a server-named queue name, you can declare them with passive = true
which will simply do nothing if the queue exists and raise a channel exception if the queue
does not exist.

Matthias,
thanks for helpfull reply!

And one more question that has stayed without answer:
why after such problems order of messages changes?
For example I send 1,2,3,4,5 messages (prefetch count is 20) and on 6
message I have problem...
After network problem the next processed message is 25, but not 6.
RabbitMQ paste unack message to the end of a queue?
Is it any method to save ordering of messages?

By "problem" do you mean the client disconnects and reconnects?

And when you reconnect, has rabbitmq definitely seen the old connection 
disappear? Check the server logs for the sequencing of the 
connect/disconnect events.

Not in recent versions. though there are some caveats. See 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/semantics.html#ordering

If you have a scenario where you think the ordering semantics defined on 
that page is violated, then capture a trace with the RabbitMQ protocol 
tracer (http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#tracer), inspect the 
output, and if after that you still think there is a problem then post 
the trace here.

There are two ways to consume messages from RabbitMQ:

 * "Push API" (basic.consume, creating a long-running subscription)
 * "Pull API" (basic.get, very similar to HTTP GET)

Matthias,

problems - is setting on a firewall with REJECT, as a result i catch an
error in point (1)
and call deinit -> init.
In deinit I call
amqp_connection_close(connection, AMQP_REPLY_SUCCESS);
amqp_destroy_connection(connection);
and in init I reply all init sequence:
amqp_new_connection();
amqp_login_with_properties()
and so on.

I don't have a possibility to get trace, but I think that new connection is
started before the server
delete old connection. 
And how I can avoid this situation? I don't know when server find connection
error and close old connection.

It takes time to detect dead connections and TCP will try redelivery first. This is why
RabbitMQ has heartbeats, to detect that the peer has disconnect earlier.

> error and close old connection. 

If you use REJECT for TCP traffic on a firewall, it does not immediately indicate that the connection
is closed to RabbitMQ. Either find a different way of testing what you are trying to test,
or set heartbeat interval to a low value (e.g. a few seconds).

Consumers know nothing about publishers unless publishers include some information
into message metadata. See https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-python.html
for a common request/reply implementation.

The enabled plugins file is stored in %RABBITMQ_BASE% - by default, 
%APPDATA%\RabbitMQ\enabled_plugins.

So is %APPDATA% somehow non-persistent across reboots on your machine? 
If so you probably want to point %RABBITMQ_BASE% elsewhere since that 
contains the message store too!

See http://www.rabbitmq.com/relocate.html for more information.

Michael, thanks for reply!

And how can I set heartbeat value using rabbitmq-c?
Is it enough to past such value to amqp_basic_qos method?

Or I have to form and send to served additional property (such for cancel
consumer notification)?

It has to be specified during connection negotiation, so look at
various connection options. I'm not sure if librabbitmq-c actually
supports heartbeats.

> Is it enough to past such value to amqp_basic_qos method?

basic.qos controls prefetch value for a channel, not heartbeats

So, are you looking at Node.js RabbitMQ client tutorials?

If so, amqp.node has tutorials code ported [1].

 when accessing Overview Tab
Message-ID: <5364289F36AB9D48904552794BA271CA28261FCE3C@XC203447.MELINDA.LOCAL>

Hello,

Currently on version 3.1.3, on a specific server (windows 2K8  R2 x64 server), when I'm trying to get overview tab shown, I have following error :

TypeError: The value of the property 'queue_length' is null or undefined, not a Function object

I've tried to reinstall server, restart it, enable/disable plugin, suppress Database, etc ... And it still doesn't works.

Is anyone having an idea on that ?

Thanks by advance

I did not want to share.
My consumer was stopped.  At that time the queue was piling up messages
for my consumer.
When restarting my consumer, I simply wanted to declare it and rebind
that auto-generated named queue.
I understand that it is not possible.

Applications cannot declare entities that start with amq.

Server-named queues are supposed to be used (and declared) only by
consumers. It makes no sense to use them if you share the name between
multiple services. In that case, use well known names that do not start
with amq.

If you really need to share a server-named queue name, you can declare
them with passive = true which will simply do nothing if the queue
exists and raise a channel exception if the queue does not exist.

Seenivasan,

Your email has reached the list 4 times now, no need to post more.

Can you be a little more specific about what your setup is like?
What plugins are enabled, what your applications do (over Rabbit)
and when you observe these errors?

Thanks.

MK

This particular warnings means that an AMQP 0-9-1 connection wasn't closed
properly by a client (it just terminated TCP connection instead). This is harmless.

JSON-RPC uses long polling so if a browser client goes away without properly
disconnecting, you will see the HTTP Channel timeout (it should be a warning, too).
Again, this is harmless and indicates clients not disconnecting properly.

Also, have you considered using SockJS or WebSTOMP with the STOMP plugin?
JSON-RPC is a pretty old plugin that is not being actively worked on.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Java Client and Admin
Message-ID: <c1bb987e-8e5b-4bda-a489-4e7da057ff3b@googlegroups.com>

Hello, 
We have two questions about the Java API :

   1. We want to check if a specific policy exist and, if necessary create 
   it, and assign it to the right queue.
   Is there a way to do this with the Java client ?
   
   2. We observe , with a mirrored queue, that if we are not connected to 
   the Master Node ( aka the node which hosted the queue), We have less 
   performance on consuming messages.
   Is it normal? (queue mirrored on 2 node, queue persistent and messages 
   persistent)
   If yes, we want to get the master node of the queue to connect on it.
   Is there a way to get this information with the java client api?

We know that we can realize this 2 "actions" with the REST API but, if it's 
possible I don't want to mix administration of my rabbitmq between java api 
and rest api.

Regards, 
Mike

RabbitMQ Java client is AMQP 0-9-1, HTTP API currently does not have a Java client
(at least the official one).

Yes, because then the node that your consumer is connected to has to request messages
from the master. Intra-cluster communication takes some time.

> If yes, we want to get the master node of the queue to connect on it.
> Is there a way to get this information with the java client api?

HTTP API provides the information you are looking for.

/api/queues/{vhost}/{queue} should contain "node" key that indicates
which node is master.

Hello Michael,
thanks for your answer.

I know that I can do it with the HTTP API but that's I want to know is :
if I can do this with the RabbitMQ Java Client (
http://www.rabbitmq.com/java-client.html)
or this client is only for consumer/producer and I must use the HTTP API.

Regards,

There is no way to do this in AMQP 0-9-1 and thus the Java client. Using HTTP API
is the only way.

so the app starts, but then blows up after 3 seconds...


I tried, re-referencing the jar files , setting the minimum SDK version to 7 , but nothing works

Please Help...

Thanks in advance

It sounds like a classpath issue. What Java version does the Dalvik release you target support?

Message-ID: <etPan.52338c92.22cc3dbb.22ad@heartoftheneutronstar.local>

Hello all

I need to change the erlang cookie on my RabbitMQ server to get clustering working, and wish to know the correct procedure.

I tried doing this:

rabbitmqctl stop_app
vi /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
rabbitmqctl start_app # this gave me an error message:?Error: unable to connect to node 'rabbit at ben-amqp-test4': nodedown

By trial and error, I found this worked:
pkill beam
pkill epmd
vi /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
rabbitmq-server?
# now in a separate window, for some reason it didn't work with rabbitmq-server -detached
rabbitmqctl start_app

That seemed to work, but is ugly, and doesn't feel like the right way of doing it.

Also, what is the difference between "rabbitmqctl start_app" and "rabbitmq-server"?

Thanks in advance

The Erlang cookie belongs to each particular user on your machines.
The cookie can be found on ~/.erlang.cookie and you need to have the same
value there for every node in the cluster.

start_app stops the Rabbit application inside the Erlang VM but the VM has
to be running for that to work.

stop_app will stop the rabbit app, but not the Erlang VM

rabbitmq-server takes care of preparing the env parameters and starting the
Erlang VM to then run RabbitMQ on it.

Regards,

Alvaro

Thank you Alvaro,

I understand? the difference between rabbitmq-server and rabbitmqctl now.

I'm still not able to copy or edit the Erlang cookie without killing the process. I see two different .erlang.cookie files: one in /var/lib/rabbitmq and one in the users home directory. I copied the first to the second and still got the "unable to connect" problem

I am running version 3.1.3.1 on CentOS

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Mnesia crashes on rmq clustering !
Message-ID: <1379139421110-29634.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi,

I've setup rmq clustering on multiple severs with HA queues. But recently
I've noticed one issue with clustering and that is it fails after every
couple of days. When I did some investigation with rmq log files then I saw
following issues logged there :

=ERROR REPORT==== 10-Sep-2013::16:02:30 ===
Mnesia(rabbit at producer): ** ERROR ** mnesia_event got
    {inconsistent_database, running_partitioned_network, rabbit at consumer01}


After reading couple of posts by other people on this issue I get to know
this problem is because inter-network communication failure / network
partition. Though it sounds very difficult for me to move all servers into
same network to get rid of this problem.

Are shovel and federation are good use here over clustering ? If yes ? then
which one is faster and issue free.

Thanks in advance.
Tluck

Shovel and federation both use AMQP 0-9-1 connections which will be recovered.
Note that both are asynchronous replication tools (AP in CAP), while clustering
is CP.

See http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html
and http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html.

Just to add to what Michael said: no replication scheme in a distributed system will be "issue free", but the right tool(s) will enable you to manage the challenges that distribution entails.

Shovel and Federation both provide a means for replicating state across a wide area (or other) network, but require that you write your client in such a way that it can handle duplication (which is good practise anyway). Clustering/HA provides transparent replication without message loss, but doesn't handle network partitions well.

You can, therefore, decide where to invest effort in building your system - either in preventing or handling (through infrastructure management) partitions, or in handling replication yourself. It's advisable to focus your efforts on (a) the scenario you're most likely to encounter vs the risks involved,  and/or (b) the solution and technology with which you're more comfortable (e.g., managing replication over AMQP or handling network design, dealing with partitions using various sysops tools).

Cheers,
Tim

You will have one Erlang cookie per user that started a distributed Erlang
VM. Say you run RrabbitMQ as the user "rabbit". Erlang will create a cookie
for that user.

Then with your own user you try to run rabbitmqctl. That will create an
Erlang cookie in your home folder, and that cookie _won't_ match the one
created for RabbitMQ. What you have to do is either make sure both files
have the same content, or set the cookie during startup, or update it
afterwards to match the one of the other node you are trying to connect to.

See: http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html#id83622

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ custom exchange (script-exchange

Message-ID: <1379204450858-29639.post@n5.nabble.com>

By default when I send a message with absent routing_key, the broker rejects
it. How can I force RabitMQ to send one to the some 'default' queue? For
example, I have 3 consumers with keys 'con1', 'con2' and 'con4'. I send a
message with the key 'con3' and I need broker requeues message to some
'starter' queue that can start 'con3' consumer and requeue message again?

I found this https://github.com/tonyg/script-exchange and I sure it helps
me, but I can't install it because the repository updated 4 years ago and
modern umbrella dev kit is not support this old makefile.

Publish with mandatory = true and it will be returned to the client. Or try AE [1].

I think an Alternate Exchange will fit your use case. Read more here:

I thought about AE using but the message with routing key 'con3' will requeue
to alternate exchange with the same key and obviously will be not processed
by 'default' consumer, will it?

You need to have a queue bound to the Alternate Exchange. Then later you
can add a consumer and process the messages from that queue. Keep in mind
that you don't need consumers for the messages to be queued, you need
queues for that.

The example on that page show's how to set all up.

I misunderstood a little..
So I have an usual direct exchange with 3 queues named 'q1', 'q2' and 'q4'
and an alternate exchange with queue 'default' and 2 bound consumers. I want
the 'default' consumers process messages having an absent routing key ('q3'
for example). However, when I send the message with key 'q3' it will resend
to alternate exchange and reject there because AE does not know what to do
with messages with 'q3' key..

Any one changes -define(DEFAULT_CREDIT, {200, 50}). ?
It seems the throughput changes when I modify these 2 param.

Make your AE a fanout so that it routes everything to the queue named
'default'.

You keep saying "rejected", unroutable messages are not rejected, they are
either

1. Returned to the client
2. Re-published to AE
3. Dropped

In case of 2, you need to make sure that AE can route them somewhere, like
with
any other exchange.

Thanks for reply.
Your advice is almost what I need, but it will be excellent if my AE can
send messages in round-robin-like way. Is it possible to do that? I mean
when i have 3 'default' consumers the first route-absent message sends to
the first, second - to the second one, etc.

And my last question is how can I install script-exchange on the modern
RabbitMQ server?

1. consistent-hash-exchange (bundled with rabbitmq, needs to be enabled via
rabbitmq-plugin)
2. round-robin distribution happens between consumers on a shared queue

HI Tim,

Thanks for your reply. 

<< Shovel and Federation both provide a means for replicating state across a
wide area (or other) network, but require that you write your client in such
a way that it can handle duplication (which is good practise anyway).

What do you mean by this ? you mean that Shovel & Federation don't replicate
messages completely across RMQ severs/brokers (but clustering replicates
messages cross all servers).

I've about 20 servers (nodes) and  they all are connected through rabbitmq
clustering. Only one server is responsible for publishing messages into
queues (and messages get replicated via clustering) and all other severs are
responsible for consuming messages from the queues. As I'm facing network
partition issue after every few days, this has became a complete mess.

Can anyone please suggest me which RMQ distribution method would be more
successful to meet my requirements ?

Thanks,
Tluck

IE9 works, my mistake.  My test pages were writing to the JS console
without checking if it was open and this was the problem, nothing to do
with socksjs.

Why do you have 20 servers? Why not just one? Or perhaps two (for fault 
tolerance)?

Message-ID: <27E054594442884E9A46DBCF9AE7408160F6C9@BSDMSATMBX001.mahindrasatyam.ad>

Hi,

I am working client-server based design using rabbitmq 3.1.5, In my design I am publishing message from client with specific routing key and listening at server by creating queues(Durable and giving explicit ack) with Exactly same name. But I am facing issue that some times at  my listener the message stuck into the listener queue(which is durable) at server end. And if I try again and again to publish on same queue the messages just get queued into queue and my listener unable to get the request from publisher.

My question is How I can make sure that any message should not stuck into the queue and deliver without fail to the listener??

Please Help.

Thanks you,
Rohit

Hi Michael,
Thanks for your reply..

I am using eclipse Indigo (version 3.7), also just installed the ADT version 18.
in addition, tried marking all Jars as export in the build path configuration but that did not work either.
I had to drop the android minimum version project to 7 (originally had it at 8) for it to compile, but now this issue is happening at runtime..
I'm open to any suggestions or ideas..
thanks in advance once more

Luis

It sounds like a classpath issue. What Java version does the Dalvik release you target support?

What do you mean by this? If a queue has consumers, then it will deliver
the messages to them. If the consumer then ack's the message, it will be
deleted from the queue.

It's not very clear what you mean by "stuck into the listener queue at server end". If you shut down your
consumer without acknowledging messages, RabbitMQ will notice and re-queue them. Either
use automatic acknowledgements or always ack or reject messages before consumer apps
shut down.

> My question is How I can make sure that any message should not stuck into the queue and deliver without fail to the listener??

Again, not sure what you are doing.

Messages should be delivered to consumers with respect to channel's prefetch (delivery limit) value.
By default it is "no limit".

See Tutorial 2:
https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html

for more information and please post relevant snippets of your code and maybe a RabbitMQ
management UI screenshot(s).

Hi Matthias,

>> Why do you have 20 servers ? Why not just one? Or perhaps two (for fault

We do some site scrapping and for that we need different IPs to save
yourself from being blocked by the site. This is why we have 20 servers for
handling all this. Do you think that using Rabbitmq is not a right solution
for this ?


Thanks,
Tluck

AMQP is a client-server protocol. Producers and consumers can run on 
different machines from the server. So I don't understand why you need a 
cluster of 20 *rabbit* servers. A single server, with 1 producer and ~20 
consumer machines connecting to it should suffice.

Thanks for your quick reply. I got your point. Let me see how performance is
going to impact after using this scenario (1 producer and 20 consumers
hitting to it).

I'm not sure you can, it looks like it needs some updates to compile 
against modern RabbitMQ.

But from the other thread it looks like AE is what you really want.

Umm, really?

If I was running a scraper and kept finding myself blocked I might start 
to think about what I was doing to provoke that.

A cheap AMD 8 core for 150$ should be able to saturate any 10 Gbit
connector. I really don't understand, why RabbitMQ is so sloooow.

Any ideas?

For what workload?

Are you sure that OP's workload will use 8 cores? Is there any indication
that the link is not saturated already?

Reasons of "so slooow" are context-dependent and there's not enough
information to recommend anything.

Hi Simon,

I'm aware about how they block a server from hitting their website. As per
their site policy if  they see more then 1 request coming from same IP at
the same time then they block the ip of requesting server for a few days.

Thanks,
Tluck

Are you trying to monitor a Rabbit node/cluster and want to alert on
message rates being lower than some expected value?

HTTP API can help with that:
http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-management/raw-file/3646dee55e02/priv/www-api/help.html

Note that those rates indicate throughput, which is only one metric.
Some systems care much more about latency.

Hi,

Our RabbitMQ service just decided that it would not start up anymore and present this error to the reason why:
=ERROR REPORT==== 15-Sep-2013::23:35:10 ===

I don't know why this happened but I couldn't just restart the service. In the sasl log file I found this:

Running

C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /cdir /-C /W \"c:/Users/bme/AppData/Roaming/RabbitMQ/db/rabbit at APPS-mnesia\"

fails due to "eacces" (likely insufficient permissions).

Check if anything has changed around RabbitMQ user and/or
the directory permissions.

let me explain my requirement , suppose  in the particular node. the
performance is slow means so automatically i have to increase the no workers
. so that to improve the performance ..
so for that reason , how want know , how i can  find the performance is slow

RabbitMQ HTTP API should provide you pretty detailed information about
message rates for individual queues. Use those metrics to implement the
scaling logic you need.

Message-ID: <1379341010.8454.YahooMailNeo@web141106.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>



UPDATE:

just wanted to share what I was missing for the intent and the app to fire ok:
I completely missed the <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"></uses-permission>

without this line the intent was not firing the right way..
I am targeting a min sdk of 7

Now the app builds and runs , I am facing another issue: the fact that I cannot perform a networking operation on a main thread (pic shows logs)..
I have read that the Best way is to do an Async Task..
trying to figure out the code for it...

Hi,

Does anybody know if there is an opensource tool available for performance
and load testing of RabbitMQ.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <56f0a17c-2c4f-4bda-badc-4c5d577ca114@googlegroups.com>

Would like to start the discussion on what ( if any ) the Mobile Client for 
RabbitMQ should look like in terms of functionality / features.

For me I would like to see the following:

- Overview ( Something like the management plugin overview tab )
  * minus the import / export functionality

- Connections

- Queues
  * With get and submit message functionality

- Admin
  * User creation/permissions

Would also like to see some sort of alert functionality ( Push 
Notifications ) for:

- Node Down
- Server Restart
- Disc Space
- RAM usage

if anyone else has some ideas as to what should be in the mobile 
app/client, feel free to voice them here

I wrote an application based on EasyNetQ which is available for use by anyone.

https://github.com/chrisedebo/RabbitMQ.LoadTest

It will require a set of text files which are randomly passed across the message bus by the publishers. The subscriber will retrieve these messages and output a count to the console.

Have a look and let me know if you need any assistance with it.

Those are not necessarily errors.

They're logged by the JSON-RPC channel plugin. This plugin emulates 
sort-of-AMQP-ish messaging, implemented underneath by HTTP polling.

The timeouts occur when a browser goes away without sending a channel / 
connection close. Quite plausible.

> HTTP Channel started, timeout 2000

This means a channel has started with a 2000s timeout.

> HTTP Channel timed out, closing.

This means a timeout occurred.

Cheers, Simon

There was a thread about this message just a few days ago.

It's not really an error. It means that HTTP client (in case of JSON-RPC, a Web browser)
disconnected and its connection timed out.

It should be a warning since it's harmless.

channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')

channel.basic_publish(exchange='',

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Web admin interface - doesn't filter Connection
 nor Channels tabs by virtual host
Message-ID: <d368de6f-d178-4be6-b7b5-84be34b8096f@googlegroups.com>

Minor issue/defect.

The Virtual Host drop down box in the upper right of the page does *not *filter 
table rows to the selected virtual host on the following tabs:

   - Connection
   - Channels

The filtering *does *work on the Exchanges and Queues tab (and is very 
helpful).
There is a virtual host column on the Connection and Channels tab so it 
would seem like filtering would be available.  It would be helpful, 
especially for the Connetions tab to have the filtering feature.

We are using RabbitMQ v3.1.5
Browsing from Chrome v29

Recommend adding the support to filter on these two tabs, or 
hiding/disabling the filter drop down if filtering is not possible or not 
intended for these tabs.

Thank you Alvaro, turns out on my setup the rabbitmq user's home directory was /var/lib/rabbitmq, and I thought /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie was common to all users

The Erlang cookie belongs to each particular user on your machines. The?cookie can be found on ~/.erlang.cookie and you need to have the same value there for every node in the cluster.

start_app stops the Rabbit application inside the Erlang VM but the VM has to be running for that to work.?

stop_app will stop the rabbit app, but not the Erlang VM

rabbitmq-server takes care of preparing the env parameters and starting the Erlang VM to then run RabbitMQ on it.

Hello all

I need to change the erlang cookie on my RabbitMQ server to get clustering working, and wish to know the correct procedure.

I tried doing this:

rabbitmqctl stop_app
vi /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
rabbitmqctl start_app # this gave me an error message:?Error: unable to connect to node 'rabbit at ben-amqp-test4': nodedown

By trial and error, I found this worked:
pkill beam
pkill epmd
vi /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
rabbitmq-server?
# now in a separate window, for some reason it didn't work with rabbitmq-server -detached
rabbitmqctl start_app

That seemed to work, but is ugly, and doesn't feel like the right way of doing it.

Also, what is the difference between "rabbitmqctl start_app" and "rabbitmq-server"?

Thanks in advance

Yeah, it's been on the list of things to take a look at for some time. 
Hopefully I'll get to it at some point...

Hmm. That looks like some problem (in the server) encoding the response 
to connection.start-ok, i.e. connection.tune. Have you customised the 
frame_max or heartbeat setting in the rabbitmq.config file? Can you post 
your config?

I did not set frame_max.

Here is my config:

[
    {rabbit, [
                {tcp_listeners, [5672]},
                {log_levels, [{connection, info}]}
            ]},
    {rabbitmq_mochiweb, [
                {listeners, [{mgmt, [{port, 8091}]}]}
            ]}
].

=========================================================

By the way, I change rabbitmq-server version to 2.8.7, send.py and recv.py
can send/recv message.
But I want to know why?

Does it change for the better or the worse? What change did you make?

When we developed the flow control feature we considered making this 
tunable, but there seemed to be a fairly broad plateau for the initial 
credit values with broadly similar performance, so we just picked values 
in the middle of that range and stuck with it. If you have a scenario 
where tuning this value does something useful I'd like to hear about it...

Cheers, Simon

Hmmm. Strange.

Please post the output of 'rabbitmqctl environment'.

Hi,

To add some more context to this thread. This comes up from a conversation
with Phill on Twitter where he asked if we (RabbitMQ) provided a mobile
version of the management plugin.

I think it'd be nice to discuss here if there's enough interest in
something like this. The management plugin offers a REST API, so this
should be doable.

Regards,

Alvaro

The other day I was wondering the same and I randomly changed the defaults
to this: {20000, 50} and it hurt performance badly, at least for the very
simple test I was running of "push as many small messages as possible".

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Towards better handling of RabbitMQ
	connection/channel failures
Message-ID: <CA+es_-y=cPBnS2W-+k8Gp+XS32JjaRcYK438AeP9B4tpW3K2MQ@mail.gmail.com>

I've been experimenting with various sorts of RabbitMQ failures that result
in connections and channels being shutdown with the goal of being able to
re-establish connections, channels, and consumers whenever a failure
occurs. In particular, I've been forcing network partitions on a
pause_minority configured cluster with a client connected to what will
become the minority node, to see how things behave, and the results are a
bit inconsistent.

For a simple test, I created 2 connections and 6 channels then partitioned
the cluster. Within a minute or so the minority node (to which my client is
connected connected) shuts itself down. What happens next varies a bit
which each test run:

Outcome 1: Immediately the shutdown listeners for my 2 connections and all
6 channels are called.

Outcome 2: Immediately 2 of my 6 channels' shutdown listeners are called.
None of the connection shutdown listeners are called. After waiting a few
minutes I heal the partition and the shutdown listeners for the 2
connections and the remaining 4 channels are immediately called.

Outcome 3: Immediate 2 of my 6 channels' shutdown listeners are called.
None of the connection shutdown listeners are called. After about 30
seconds, with the cluster still partitioned, the shutdown listeners for the
2 connections and the remaining 4 channels are immediately called.

---

I'm interested to learn more about when and why certain shutdown listeners
might or might not be invoked so I can do a better job of re-establishing
resources after a failure. Any input is appreciated.

Cheers,
Jonathan

hi, Matthias,

After I retry with rabbit-server2.8.7, which works very well, then I switch
to rabbiter-server3.1.5, It can work now.

so I can not give the environment which has problem.

thx

Hello Team ,

              I am new to Rabbitmq and i am bit confused on shovel .

About our setup ,

we have 2 Data center , ie , Mumbai DC and BLR DC

Mumbai DC

we have 3 node cluster 2.8.7  RB15B02

BLR DC also have similar setup ..

we have installed the shovel on one of the BLR DC node and configured
the shovel.config file as follows ..

[ source MumbaiDC url

 mumbai queues

desination

         Bangalore Dc
            Q Name

for 5 virtual hosts


again
[Source Bangalore DC url

    Bangalore Queues

Destination
     Mumbai DC
     Q name

].

I have few questions ?

how this shovel act upon one DC failure /Network failure ?

How i can bounce the service gracefully in this scenario ?

How to handle the issue  if any the Rabbitmq are overloaded ?

Any possibility to recover the messages from the queue? if the whole
DC down (mumbai)

Regards
sagu

Shovel is AP in CAP, it will try to reconnect and republish messages.

If you need replication with more than one point, consider federation or
perhaps a load balancer in front of Shovel.

> How to handle the issue  if any the Rabbitmq are overloaded ?

Below is a very generic advice without knowing any details about
your workload.

Add more nodes to the cluster (Shovel can replicate between clusters),
make some clients connect to the new node and use additional queues there.
More nodes will not help you if the issue is a single giant queue (queues are
not sharded: this may be implemented in a future version).

You can monitor queue lengths and message rates using HTTP API and
add more nodes to the cluster when you consider it overloaded.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Sometimes RabbitMQ sends RST packets
Message-ID: <1379405333380-29701.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi there!
Now I have a problem that server RabbitMQ sometimes sends to me the RST
packets.
Scenario is as below:
1) I create about 10 consumers (declare exchanges, queues, make binds and
start consume)
2) Create producer (which use own connection and that use confirm extantion
with mandatory bit set on)
3) After that I delete all consumers (make unbind and close using channels
and connections)
4) try to send message from my producer... and amqp_basic_publish returns
error 9 (socket error)
and in WireShark i see that server send to me RST packet.

Do you have any idea what is the problem? And in that cases server can send
RST packets?

RabbitMQ supports multi-tenancy via vhosts (similar to Apache or Nginx vhosts).

Graylog2 probably uses its own vhost and by default the UI presents you the default
vhost (/). See the switcher in the top right corner:

https://www.monosnap.com/image/7aINJygDxDsomYVqwb9AvTw7s

and select the vhost you need. Note that you may need to log out and
log back in with a user that has access to the Graylog2 vhost.

RabbitMQ is good for inter-app communication but it's not really a database.

You can use one queue or one queue per user but in the end there has to be an app (or multiple apps) that consumes those messages and stores them somewhere.

Activity collection is certainly a very common use case, see [1] and [2] [3].

As a general advice, you can start with 1 queue and once that queue gets congested, move to
multiple queues (e.g. using consistent hashing exchange) and more consumer apps.

If the broker was responsible for forcing the connection to close then
the reason will be in the logfile. Check in the regular and sasl logfiles.

If the TCP connection is mediated by an intelligent network device then
that intermediary could be responsible for the RST. Try to rule that out
if it is a possibility.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ - Erlang AMQP client - mutual SSL
	authentication problem
Message-ID: <ABBDC9D7002EB54AB98BA60DA16D269333FEA9CD@FR44EX3003.global.ds.honeywell.com>

Hello,

I have a problem with establishing SSL connections between Erlang AMQP client (v. 3.0.2) and RabbitMQ server (v. 3.1.3). I need to use mutual authentication, i.e. I need to authenticate the server to the client with the server certificate as well as the client to the server with the client certificate. Authenticating the server to the client works fine (ssl_fail_if_no_peer_cert set to "true" at the client and to "false" at the server), but I am not able to make the client-to-servet authentication work ("true at both sides").

My SSL configs are the following:
RabbitMQ:
---------
{rabbit, [
        {ssl_listeners, [5677]},
        {ssl_options, [ {cacertfile, "/etc/ssl/xxx/ca_cert.pem"},
                                        {certfile, "/etc/ssl/xxx/cert.pem"},
                                        {keyfile, "/etc/ssl/xxx/key.pem"},
                                        {fail_if_no_peer_cert, true},
                                        {verify, verify_peer}
                ]
        }
        ]
},

Client:
--------
{port, 5677},
{ssl_cert_ca, "/etc/ssl/xxx/swim-ca_cert.pem"},
{ssl_cert, "/etc/ssl/xxx/cert.pem"},
{ssl_key, "/etc/ssl/xxx/key.pem"},
{ssl_verify, verify_peer},
{ssl_fail_if_no_peer_cert, true},
{username, <<"aaa">>},
{password, <<"aaa">>},
-----------------

I tried everyting that was suggested on the troubleshooting website (http://www.rabbitmq.com/troubleshooting-ssl.html) - check SSL support in Erlang, check the client and server certificates using OpenSSL, check broker listenning on SSL port, attempt SSL connection to broker using OpenSSL, validate client connections with stunnel.. I did not get any errors! I even tried to connect with the Erlang AMQP client to the OpenSSL server - this also worked! (I just got AMQP connection setup timeout after the SSL connection setup - which is not suprprising)

The error I am getting on the client side is:
---------------------------------------------------
{error, esslconnect}

The broker log says:
-------------------------
=ERROR REPORT==== 17-Sep-2013::10:39:40 ===
error on AMQP connection <0.9012.1>: {ssl_upgrade_error,esslaccept} (unknown POSIX error)

=ERROR REPORT==== 17-Sep-2013::10:39:40 ===

---------------------------


Do you have any idea what could be wrong and how to fix it?

Thank you for any thaughts!
Michal

Ruby RabbitMQ HTTP API client 0.4.0 is released.

This is a minor feature release. Release notes:
http://blog.rubyrabbitmq.info/blog/2013/09/17/rabbitmq-http-api-client-0-dot-4-0-is-released/

Note that technically this is a breaking API change. However,
the new behavior is much more sane compared to 0.2.x and 0.3.x versions.

Michal,

According to Erlang ssl docs, this reason means that

"Server SSL handshake procedure between client and server failed"

I suspect that either party refuses to accept the certificate presented by the peer.
Have you tried connecting with openssl s_client to see if it performs
handshake successfully?

Note that the shovel *does* allow you to specify multiple URIs for a 
shovel (so the remote broker can be a cluster and it will fail over as 
needed). And also since 3.1.0 you can declare multiple shovels with the 
same name on different nodes of your cluster, only one will run (and 
fail over as needed) so you can fail over at either end without needing 
a load balancer. So in this respect it's similar to federation.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Problem using SSL in .NET Client
Message-ID: <3F9B2404D7F4C24892FC9C96704967B6FBCE838D9D@HERMES.centrica.es>

Hi Everyone,

I am trying to build a .NET Client to connect to a RabbitMQ server and it requires authentication with a certificate and using SSL.

I have installed:

OpenSSL version 1.0.1
Erlang version 5.10.2
RabbitMQ version 3.1.3
RabbitMQ Dotnet Client version 2.4.1

All of this is installed on Windows XP.

In the RabbitMQ support for SSL page it suggests loading the certificate from the certificate store and setting ConnectionFactory's Ssl.Certs parameter. I am attempting to use code similar to the following, which I found on the internet, to achieve this:

X509Store store = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser);
store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);

X509Certificate cert = store.Certificates
                .Find(
                X509FindType.FindByThumbprint,
                "82 3a 7e 85 a1 cf ca 6f 83 29 4b 3b 91 02 4a d7 af 4c 7a 08",
                true
               )
        .OfType<X509Certificate>()
        .First();

oFactory.Ssl.Certs = new X509CertificateCollection(new X509Certificate[] { cert });
oFactory.Ssl.Certs.Add(cert);
oFactory.Ssl.ServerName = "servercertificatename";
oFactory.Ssl.Enabled = true;

The problem is that this code will not compile in Visual Studio because of this line:

oFactory.Ssl.Certs = new X509CertificateCollection(new X509Certificate[] { cert });

The compiler gives an error saying that the Certs property is read only.

I wonder if this is to do with not having the right version of one of the various platforms (OpenSSL, Erlang, RabbitMQ) or perhaps not having installed them in the right order or having missed some necessary configuration step.

I tried to determine if  there is an error in the configuration of OpenSSL by using werl.exe as recommended on RabbitMQ's SSL Troubleshooting page and typing in "ssl:versions()", but this gives no result at all - werl.exe just outputs "1>".

Can anyone see where the problem might be?

Thanks in advance for any help.
Richard

Any particular reason you're using such an old version of the .net 
client? A quick search suggests that said Certs property used to be read 
only, but is not in more recent versions.

If your code won't compile, the problem is quite likely to be in the client.

You need a full stop to terminate the expression. i.e. "ssl:versions()."

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Send message and wait for ACK for X seconds
Message-ID: <a336e250-59d5-43c8-89d8-97f528bf57f8@googlegroups.com>

I have a basic work queue, and some work tasks are very fast. I can't 
predict whether a task will take 0.1s or 10min.

What I'd like to do is have the producer (HTTP web request) send a job to a 
worker, and wait for 3 seconds. If the job is done by then, then I can 
display "OK" to the user, else I stop waiting and I display "It will be 
effective soon".

A way to do this is using a RPC-style, bidirectional communication. That's 
unnecessarily complex because I don't need the result of the job.

Another way would be to simply wait for the ACK of the worker (task 
completed).

So my question: is there a way to wait for the ACK of a message (i.e. 
consumer finished processing it) on the producer side?

Thanks!

I'm afraid not--the Acks are just used by the broker itself, and they're
not exposed to clients. The nearest you could get is by polling the
numbers of acknowledged / unacknowledged messages in a given queue, but
that would (at best) be an approximation.

If you don't want to send replies via RabbitMQ, then it might suffice to
use a side channel--eg: set a flag in Redis or other database. That
said, unless you otherwise need that information (eg: recording the that
something about an entity has changed) it'd likely just add more
complexity than sending the reply via Rabbit.

Hope that helps,

I think that problem is with heartbeat.
Is it true that heartbeat is sent in both directions - from server to client
and from client to server?

For example if I set heartbeat param to 2 sec after what time server will
close the connection?
(I think server wait 2*N seconds, where N > 1)

Ok, I just fixed it!
It was a well hidden bug. In the "connector" module of my app I had an extra pair {}. Unfortunately, the Erlang AMQP client did not complain and silently ignored it.

Instead of:
#amqp_params_network{ssl_options = [{cacertfile, xxx},																{certfile, xxx},
						{keyfile, xxx},
						{verify, verify_peer},
						{fail_if_no_peer_cert, true}]}
I had:
#amqp_params_network{ssl_options = [{{cacertfile, xxx},																{certfile, xxx},
						{keyfile, xxx},
						{verify, verify_peer},
						{fail_if_no_peer_cert, true}}]}

Thank you for your effort, Michael, and sorry for wasting your time.
Michal

The problem has corrected itself. Somehow it solved itself when I upgraded Java (but I fail to see the connection).

But what is bothering me is that RabbitMQ appears to need something from my login (bme) directory. Can't RabbitMQ be installed as a system service that does not rely on a users homedirectory?

Running

C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /cdir /-C /W \"c:/Users/bme/AppData/Roaming/RabbitMQ/db/rabbit at APPS-mnesia\"

fails due to "eacces" (likely insufficient permissions).

Check if anything has changed around RabbitMQ user and/or the directory permissions.

Erlang reads ~/.erlang.cookie, everything else can be stored elsewhere.

Message-ID: <DB14E94115BBC84E8960C12C176D06760127ECA9F0@MX25A.corp.emc.com>

Hi,
We are using RabbitMQ (version: 3.1.3) in federation mode on two different machines. We are using "rabbitmq-c" client library to publish messages to upstream broker, and right now we are not using confirm method or message persistence. But we want to achieve message reliability i.e. we don't want to lose any messages. To achieve this, I am planning to use confirm method on publisher. I have following questions regarding the same:

*         If I get the confirmation acknowledgement, what does it mean? Is it message successfully delivered to "upstream queue" or "downstream exchange"?

*         If it guarantees delivery to "downstream exchange", then do we need to use message persistence?

*         If confirmation means delivery to upstream queue, then, I think, it makes sense to use message persistence, right? If the upstream broker crashes, then without message persistence, messages in upstream queue will be lost, right?

*         How does message persistence work? How long messages are persisted on disk? Are they removed from disk when the consumer sends the acknowledgement?

*         Or is there any other way to achieve message reliability? Any improvements or suggestions?

Thanks in Advance,
Punit

It means it was successfully published locally.

I'm not sure how you are connecting these two concepts.

Yes.

> ?How does message persistence work?

Short version: messages in queues are stored on disk. It just means that 
messages will survive a broker restart.

Long version: 
http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server/file/c4802531640a/src/rabbit_queue_index.erl#l32 
http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server/file/c4802531640a/src/rabbit_msg_store.erl#l177 
etc.

> How long messages are persisted on

Messages are persisted for as long as they're in the queue, so they are 
removed when they're acknowledged (or delivered in autoack mode).

> ?Or is there any other way to achieve message reliability? Any
> improvements or suggestions?

If you haven't done so already, you should read 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/reliability.html.

Cheers, Simon

When using Windows it gets the Erlang cookie from your home directory 
when you invoke rabbitmqctl. It gets it from c:\windows when starting 
the server.

I'd be interested to see something like this and am more than happy to 
offer advice as to the use of the HTTP API.

I would wonder whether there would be that much demand for it though. 
But maybe I'm wrong, don't let me stop you :-)

We don't currently publish Javadocs for examples like MulticastMain. But 
Javadocs would not do much, it has a method:

  public static void main(String[] args)

For the time being your best bet is to look at its usage instructions, 
unpack the Java client and invoke:

runjava.sh com.rabbitmq.examples.MulticastMain --help

We intend to improve its documentation soon.

Sounds like Shovel cannot connect upstream and times out.

Not necessarily, i.e. if the upstream is clustered. Confirmation 
indicates that the logical broker the client is talking to has taken 
responsibility for the published message.

os_mon child failed to start after a timeout. I don't know enough about
Erlang internals to quickly tell what may be the issue.

Since this message hasn't attracted any replies yet, here's a specific
question:

Why are the shutdown listeners for only some of my channels/connections
called when a rabbit server shuts down?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] When using rabbitmq-jms
 javax.jms.Message.getJMSDestination does not return the actual destination
 when it is received from a consumer listening on a Topic with a wild card
Message-ID: <851fdb0f-10a7-4041-a297-983923b2e978@googlegroups.com>

I posted this same question on the VMWare forum: 
https://communities.vmware.com/thread/457362. I am not sure what the best 
community to use for questions. So I'm copying and pasting that question 
here. 

When using rabbitmq-jms for vFabric RabbitMQ 
javax.jms.Message.getJMSDestination does not return the actual destination 
when it is received from a consumer listening on a Topic with a wild card. 
I have tested with both 1.0.3 and 1.0.5 clients with RabbitMQ 3.1.5.

 

I was wondering if the community was aware of this problem and if there are 
any workarounds? If not what is the proper channel to file a bug report. An 
example code snippet is below. The test fails because the 
TextMessageMatcher expects the destination passed in on construction 
(second parameter) to equal the desination on the message received (aquired 
from getJMSDestination).

 

        Mockery context = new Mockery();

        final MessageListener messageListener = 
context.mock(MessageListener.class);

 

        final Latch latch = new LatchImpl();

        final String prefix = "test" + System.currentTimeMillis();

 

 

 

        context.checking(new Expectations() {

            {

                oneOf(messageListener).onMessage(with(new 
TextMessageMatcher("MSG1", prefix + ".1234")));

                will(new CustomAction("release latch") {

                    @Override

                    public Object invoke(Invocation invocation) throws 
Throwable {

                        latch.unlatch();

                        return null;

                    }

                });

            }

        });

 

        final Connection connection = createConnection(null, null);

        Session session = connection.createSession(false, 
Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);

        connection.start();

 

        Topic wildcardTopic = (Topic) getInitialContext().lookup(prefix + 
"." + "#");

        Topic destination = (Topic) getInitialContext().lookup(prefix + 
".1234");

 

        final MessageConsumer consumer = 
session.createConsumer(wildcardTopic);

        consumer.setMessageListener(messageListener);

 

        MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(null);

        producer.send(destination, session.createTextMessage("MSG1"));

 

        latch.await(5000);

 

 

        connection.close();

 

 

        Thread.sleep(5);

 

 

        context.assertIsSatisfied();

We are running RabbitMQ 3.1.5 and Erlang 16B01 x64 on Windows Server 2008R2 in a clustered configuration.

We are seeing nodes crash at random and don't understand what's going on. However, there is a common theme in the logs, of which a sample is here:

Does anyone have any insight into what might be happening? We see this in several different environments with similar cluster configurations and all running the same RabbitMQ/Erlang versions?

Message-ID: <CAMK+tBh_AQDcdvF04TaPbYAr580nJCKDmJZZ8F=8itS047D9YA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Team  ,

                  I am wondering to know , if the rabbitmq cluster
overloaded due to consumer application failure .

Is there any option to import all the queue messages into hard disk
and Requeue messages on later time with that index ?


Max number of channel on rabbitmq is 49508 right  ?is that possible to
increase ?

Thank you ,

Regards
sagu

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Declare queue dynamically
Message-ID: <1379491385052-29742.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hello everyone. 

My question is whether it's possible to dynamically create queue on message
with the same routing key received by exchange? I need quite a few
(thousands may be) queues with consumers bounded, so I think it will be nice
not to declare all queues during application init, but declare necessary
queue when receive a message.

I mean I have 1000 potential consumers with their exclusive queues and when
my exchange get a message with routing_key 'consumer736' the same queue
declares automatically and the message route to it.

Big thanks for reply.

Applications can declare queues at any moment.

That would require a custom exchange type. I highly recommend declaring queues
upfront and using default exchange which exists specifically for "publishing directly to queues" (see Tutorial 1 [1]).

You need to stop RabbitMQ and back up its entire database directory. Then you can
restore it on a different machine with the same RabbitMQ version.

it's 65536 by default. Clients can negotiate this value but in practice, I haven't seen it
done and some clients probably do not make it easy or let you configure it at all.

Why do you need more than 2^16 channels?

Yes, I understand tha application can.. I thought maybe rabbitmq can also do
this.
Thanks, I will declare all queues during app init and use simple direct
exchange.

Hi Josh,

rabbitmq-jms is not open source. This may change in the future but no
decision has been taken as yet.

The Erlang client simply passes the options to Erlang's ssl:connect/2. 
So the lack of validation is down to Erlang/OTP.

All connection/channel shutdown listeners are triggered when the client detects the shutdown. When the shutdown originates at the server, this activity is mediated on the client side in one of two ways, either (a) the client received a `connection.close' AMQP method from the broker, or (b) the OS networking layer signals to the JVM that the socket has closed, at which point the listening/reading thread handles the relevant exception, tears down any associated local resources and fires the shutdown listeners. In the latter case, there can be a significant time delay before the operating system "notices" that the peer socket has closed/disappeared. Having said all that....

How did you partition the cluster?

If a RabbitMQ node decides to undertake an orderly shutdown, then all AMQP connections should be explicitly closed (as per method "a" listed above) before the network connection is severed. Where this might not work as expected, is if the network connection between client and server is unavailable and/or subject to packet loss. If the `connection.close' signal the broker sends doesn't make it to the client, then the shutdown listeners won't fire until the client's (OS) network stack detects the problem, which can take up to 30 mins depending on environment configuration.

That is what I'd expect to happen if:

1. both connections are between the client and the broker that is shutting down
2. the network link between the broker that is shutting down and the client is in good condition (no packet loss, etc) such that the connection.close from the broker arrives at the client as expected 

> Outcome 2: Immediately 2 of my 6 channels' shutdown listeners are called. None of the connection shutdown listeners are called. After waiting a few minutes I heal the partition and the shutdown listeners for the 2 connections and the remaining 4 channels are immediately called.

That doesn't sound right. If both connections are between the client and the server that is shutting down, and there is a bug in the shutdown listener handling code, then this problem would be showing up all the time (and we'd have fixed it). It is also unnecessary to consider clustering/partitions is the behaviour you describe is happening for two connection between one client and one broker.

Can you share a minimal example of the code you're using please.

> Outcome 3: Immediate 2 of my 6 channels' shutdown listeners are called. None of the connection shutdown listeners are called. After about 30 seconds, with the cluster still partitioned, the shutdown listeners for the 2 connections and the remaining 4 channels are immediately called.

There are no timing guarantees about when shutdown listeners will fire. As I mentioned, these events are only triggered when either the client "sees" a `connection.close' from the broker or detects a network failure whilst listening/sending. Since both of these factors are entirely dependent on the network between client and server, and on the networking layers of the various participating operating systems, the `connection.close' and/or socket closed exception will be detected when the client's OS delivers the relevant signal to the JVM and up into the client library's application code, at which point it is handled immediately.

In both these two cases, if some channels are being used to `send' data, and the disconnection between client and server involves loss of network connectivity, then the "sending" channels are most likely to "see" IOExceptions before the "listening" channels. Modern OS networking stacks are often configured with lower retry thresholds for sending than they are for receiving, thus detection of network failures will likely vary considerably depending on what you're doing in a particular channel over a particular connection.

If you can share an example of your client code, boiled down to the minimal details, that would help. Please also confirm exactly what your setup looks like, viz 

1. are both connections made between the client and exactly one server
2. how are you "partitioning" the server from the rest of the cluster
3. are you sending or receiving on the various channels that we're talking about

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] SSL_TIMEOUT
Message-ID: <52397AB0.2070906@alertme.com>

Hello.

We are experiencing troubles with Java clients connecting to Rabbit over 
SSL. Two problems caused by the very same issue:
* When DNS server takes more than 5 seconds in reverse resolving IP 
address back to name, Rabbit aborts the connection. I assume Java SSL 
layer does that lookup AFTER the TCP connection is already established 
in order to decide which client certificate to provide.
* When Java client is running on a limited processing power hardware, it 
again takes it more than 5 seconds to finish the SSL handshake and 
again, Rabbit server resets the connection.

I saw that reply from Emile which states SSL_TIMEOUT is not configurable 
http://rabbitmq.1065348.n5.nabble.com/Request-Handshake-Timeout-Increase-tt11342.html#a11346
And as I see in the sources, nothing has changed since then.

So my question is - do you have any plans for fixing it in the near future?
Are there any options we can modify it at runtime without rebuilding 
Rabbit? Having custom build server is the least thing we want.

Timeout of 5s is just too short really. 10 works for us but configurable 
would be even better.

Many thanks!

We have no immediate plans of making the timeout configurable. That's 
not to say we won't.

Nope.

5 seconds is a loooooong time. I suggest you look into why DNS queries 
are taking so long in your set up.

Matthias,
DNS we can fix for sure.
But we cannot make 200Mhz CPU run any faster.

Understood. Though 5 seconds is still a long time even on a 200MHz CPU. 
Think how many instructions get executed in that time :)

Thanks Josh,

This indeed appears to be a bug.  [I go to the trouble of serialising and deserializing the destination and then overwrite it with the Consumer?s destination before returning it!]

I will raise an internal bug and should have this corrected in the next release. Should you require further support this should be requested through the usual vFabric channels.

Hi all,

I've got a problem with a 2 node RabbitMQ cluster I hope someone here can shed some light one.

The cluster is a 2 node cluster and today, one of the nodes was patched and had the following updates installed:

bind-libs.9.8.2.0.17.rc1.el6_4.6.x86_64
bind-utils.9.8.2.0.17.rc1.el6_4.6.x86_64

rs-tools.0.1.17.2.el6.noarch
sos.2.2.38.el6_4.2.noarch

Upon restarting the patched server, RabbitMQ does not start.

The command "rabbitmqctl status" outputs this:

Status of node 'rabbit at 496407-Cache1' ...
Error: unable to connect to node 'rabbit at 496407-Cache1': nodedown

DIAGNOSTICS
===========

nodes in question: ['rabbit at 496407-Cache1']

hosts, their running nodes and ports:
- 496407-Cache1: [{rabbitmqctl6831,60496}]

current node details:
- node name: 'rabbitmqctl6831 at 496407-Cache1'
- home dir: /var/lib/rabbitmq
- cookie hash: AZGKHAwBPk+imgw09xDBow==

The command "service rabbitmq-server start" shows this:

Starting rabbitmq-server: FAILED - check /var/log/rabbitmq/startup_{log, _err}
rabbitmq-server.

Looking at /var/log/rabbitmq/startup_log I see this:

init terminating in do_boot",{rabbit,failure_during_boot,{error,{incompatible_bytecode,"Incompatible Erlang bytecode found on nodes

The version of elang is the same on both nodes however (This was verified with the command "erl").

I'm absolutely stumped now as I can't find anything about " Incompatible Erlang bytecode found on nodes"

Can anyone help?

Thanks

Robin

Hi. This is a stack trace we're aware of. The cause of this is a partial 
network partition - e.g. in a cluster of three nodes ABC, where A is 
partitioned from B but C can see both A and B.

We hope to mitigate this crash in a future release. In the mean time I'm 
afraid all I can suggest is that you try to ensure such partitions don't 
happen.

Cheers, Simon

 com.rabbitmq.client.AlreadyClosedException and Shutdown event
Message-ID: <ea951568-a9a8-4a6f-9fdd-e7f193513774@googlegroups.com>

Hello,

Since a week ago, I was having a lot of 
"com.rabbitmq.client.AlreadyClosedException: clean connection shutdown; 
reason: Attempt to use closed channel" the worst part was that the 
"DefaultExceptionHandler" was caught without being rethrowed, so I was 
unable to automatically restart my app when this occured. I updated to the 
last amqp-java client version but nothing changed.

So I extended AMQConnection to specify my own exception handler in order to 
crash the app (with System.exit()) when this occured.

public ExtendedAMQConnection(ConnectionFactory factory, Integer 
workerCount) throws Exception {
        super(factory.getUsername(),
                factory.getPassword(),
                new 
SocketFrameHandler(factory.getSocketFactory().createSocket(factory.getHost(), 
factory.getPort())),
                Executors.newFixedThreadPool(workerCount),
                factory.getVirtualHost(),
                factory.getClientProperties(),
                factory.getRequestedFrameMax(),
                factory.getRequestedChannelMax(),
                factory.getRequestedHeartbeat(),
                factory.getSaslConfig(),
                new DefaultExceptionHandler() {
                    @Override
                    public void handleConsumerException(Channel channel,
                                                        Throwable exception,
                                                        Consumer consumer,
                                                        String consumerTag,
                                                        String methodName) {
                        try {
                            // TODO: change this to call 4-parameter close 
and make 6-parm one private
                            ((AMQConnection) channel.getConnection())
                                    .close(AMQP.INTERNAL_ERROR,
                                            "Internal error in Consumer " + 
consumerTag,
                                            false,
                                            exception,
                                            -1,
                                            false);
                        } catch (Throwable e) {
                            console.error("handleConsumerException", e);
                            System.exit(1);
                        }
                    }
                });
        this.start();
    }

But after some time I understood that it was not the main issue, the app 
was still throwing the same error without doing anything at all to fix it 
so I added a listener to channel shutdown event:

Connection conn = new BringrAMQConnection(factory, workerCount);
Channel channel = conn.createChannel();
channel.addShutdownListener(new ShutdownListener() {
            @Override
            public void shutdownCompleted(ShutdownSignalException e) {
                console.error("RabbitMQ[channel] Shutdown. Stopping the 
server");
                System.exit(1);
            }
        });

and now I got a lot of restarts. I'm not sure I clearly understood if I 
should do something when "shutdownCompleted" occurs (I never stopped 
RabbitMQ and RabbitMQ was always running when this happened), or if 
amqp-client can handle this by itself.

I use com.rabbitmq:amqp-client:3.1.4 with a cluster of two mirrored 
RabbitMQ v3.1.1.

Recent versions of RabbitMQ required all clustered nodes to be upgraded
simultaneously. Make sure this is not the problem you are running into
by ensuring that the beam files are identical across all clustered nodes.

Check whether any servers have multiple instances of Erlang installed.
Your check would not be valid if multiple instances are present.

Unfortunately, shutdown events will be fired in both cases:

 * Unexpected shutdown (e.g. network goes down or RabbitMQ node dies)
 * Clean (application initiated) shutdown

ShutdownSignalException provides a number of methods to tell between various cases:

http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-java-client/file/0609500ae6bc/src/com/rabbitmq/client/ShutdownSignalException.java#l78

Hard errors generally cannot be recovered from. Soft errors are channel-level exceptions,
e.g. when you try to consume from a queue that does not exist.

You can also see the cause of shutdown signal, and if it's an I/O exception,
it's a good indicator that your app needs to reconnect (or even shut down and be restarted).

Hi Emile

Thanks for your feedback. Since I posted this issue I've found out that instead of the 16 updates being installed on 1 node in the cluster, 27 updates were installed include an update to rabbit which explains the problem.

I'm now in the process of attempting to rollback those updates and re-install the previously installed version of rabbit - wish me luck!

Robin

How can i disable logging in RabbitMQ in case of durable queues and 
persistent messages? I don't want my hard drive was filled with logs. 
Maybe some option or smth like this?

Thanks, Simon. That explains some of the behavior I've seen that matches
exactly what you describe - 1 node in the cluster is partitioned from
another node, but is seen by the remaining nodes. If I check the cluster
status from some nodes, all nodes in the cluster appear to be functional
with no partitions. If I check status of the cluster from the "affected"
nodes, the affected nodes show as partitioned.

Now I just need to get to the bottom of what is going on with respect to
network partitions.

Cheers,

Ron

Hi ,


How do the Producer gets response from the subscribers ..
suppose the Producer send the command to the two conumers,
each conumer has to spawns the multiple workers and each one has send the
response to the Producer like "I have done with no of worker list".

is it possible in the exchange_type='fanout'.

thanks in advance ..

Maybe for a production service you should consider rotating and otherwise
prudently managing logs for what one presumes to be an important service?

I think you've basically hit on what I'm experiencing. The client in

I wrote a test attempting to reproduce what my actual client is
experiencing, but I was only able to come close to reproducing my client's
results when pushing a lot of volume down to the consumers, and even then
it was not consistent enough to draw any conclusions. At this point I'm
satisfied to simply tweak my client to account for potential delays in
ShutdownListener calls and move on. I just wanted to be sure that there
were no mechanisms introduced by amqp-client which could be causing any
additional ShutdownListener delays, and it sounds like there are not.

Cheers,
Jonathan

I'm pretty sure there's nothing untoward going on in the java client in that respect. You might want to consider enabling AMQP heartbeats to ensure 'timely' detection of disconnects in situations where there's a possibility of network interruption.

You can't stop logging altogether.

You can silence connection logging (which is responsible for most of the 
"noise" in a typical log file) with log_levels in the configuration 
file, see http://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html#configuration-file

You probably also want to set up something like logrotate for automatic 
rotation / compression / deletion of logs. If you install RabbitMQ from 
Debian or RPM packages then this is automatically done for you.

Cheers, Simon

Currently this isn't very documented I'm afraid. It's on the list to get 
looked at, in the mean time feel free to ask here if you have specific 
questions.

It is possible to turn logging off completely by modifying the startup
scripts, but this is strongly discouraged since the broker becomes
unsupportable. This post explains how:

thanks Alvaro Videla-2,


i tried the way u suggested ,


Producer the sends a command to the consumer  to spawn the process . so each
consumer has to give the response back to the Producer ..

 but i am not getting the response back to the Producer, consumer is going
on the infinite loop...


here is the my code .. 

consumer code 
=========================
import pika
import uuid
import subprocess
import sys
import copy
import  os
class Consumer(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(

        self.queue_name = result.method.queue
        
        self.channel.queue_bind(exchange='logs',
                   queue=self.queue_name)

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] rabbitmqadmin.py SSL help
Message-ID: <CACf2s0QRD0GGZoph-csub67LunXG2geV5GwmT_S8p+ygP8MN+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have been having some issues running rabbitmqadmin.py ever since enabling
SSL. I was wondering if i could get some extra eyes to see what i am
missing, or if other people are having the same issues.

Here is the setup:

RabbitMQ version: 3.1.3
Erlang: 16B

*** Some of the following has been changed aka certs names/paths and UN/PW
***

I tried follwing the "rabbitmqadmin.py help config" page, but i keep
recieving this error message when running the command following:

Here is how i tried to exectue the command:

python rabbitmqadmin.py -c rabbitmqadmin.conf -N host_ssl

python rabbitmqadmin.py -c rabbitmqadmin.conf -N host_ssl list nodes

But i always receive the same error.

ERROR: Could not read section 'host_ssl' in config file
'rabbitmqadmin.conf':
   File contains parsing errors: rabbitmqadmin.conf
[line  2]: '  hostname = localhost\n'
[line  3]: '  port = 15671\n'
[line  4]: '  username = guest\n'
[line  5]: '  password = guest\n'
[line  6]: '  ssl = True\n'
[line  7]: '  ssl_key_file = /path/to/key.pem\n'
[line  8]: '  ssl_cert_file = /path/to/key.pem\n'

Here is the rabbitmqamdmin.conf:

[host_ssl]
  hostname = localhost
  port = 15671
  username = guest
  password = guest
  ssl = True
  ssl_key_file = /path/to/key.pem
  ssl_cert_file = /path/to/cert.pem


Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

Hi,

The only strange thing I see there are the spaces before the config lines.
You could try to validate that conf file, which looks like .ini format to
me, against and .ini parser and see what's wrong.

Cheers,

Alvaro

amqp gem 1.1.0.rc1 is released.

This version removes amq-client dependency, introduces some usability improvements
and removes more long time deprecated API elements.

Please give this version a try. A few things will be added before 1.1.0 final,
but we need some feedback about stability after substantial internal changes.

Not without changing the code. As Simon said, the timeouts are probably 
quite harmless.

Alvaro,

thanks for getting back to me. I tried removing the spaces (same error),
made it look exactly like the example in the help menu just changing my
paths and logins. Its not working.

Do you know of another way to run ssl options with the rabbitmqadmin.py?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Unbind queue when many consumers work with the
	same queue
Message-ID: <1379663526316-29782.post@n5.nabble.com>

hi there!

For example, I have a lot of consumers (workers), that consume from the same
queue.
And I want to make unbind only when the last consumer will stop.
How can I do it? 
As I understand If the first stopping consumer make unbind - the server do
it and others won't get message at all. Or server won't make unbind while
another consumers are active?

Please how does the exchange and queues fit into the whole system e.g

Jack follows john 
John follows Jack
Are you trying to say that I will have one exchange e.g ?myapp.publish ? and have another exchange myapp.read , now each of these exchanges have their own queues .

So how do I use these exchanges to produce and consume from john and jacks queues ?  , supposing I am jack and I want to publish and read data from followers real time , Thanks please bare with me as I am still studying and trying to get acquainted with ?the system .

If you make the queue auto-deleted, it will be removed when the last consumer goes
away (if there ever was at least one).

Ignoring restart scenarios for this discussion, RabbitMQ never deletes bindings unless

1. You use queue.unbind
2. A queue or exchange for the binding is deleted

It's also possible to check how many active consumers a queue has
by issuing queue.declare and inspecting the response (queue.declare-ok).

Message-ID: <20130920105824.513c7ac0@pitrou.net>


Hi,

Apologies if this has been asked already, I can't find anything in the
archives.
If I'm federating RabbitMQ exchanges together (in e.g. a reciprocal
fashion), is there any way to get notified when the federation links go
up or down?  Otherwise, do I have to write manual code to detect split
horizon situations? (at the risk of having a different view that
RabbitMQ has, if e.g. some firewall settings prevent some packets from
going through)

Thanks

Antoine.

Because elapsed is measured in milliseconds, but we want to display the

You can view the current link status via rabbitmqctl or the 
rabbitmq_federation_management plugin. See 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/federation.html#status

The federation plugin also logs when links go up or down, so you could 
check the logs.

You can't currently get a push notification about this though.

It's also worth bearing in mind that federation is designed to deal with 
split networks anyway though - messages will just get queued up and be 
delivered when the link comes back.

Cheers, Simon

Yes, but when the federation link is up, messages will be duplicated
accross exchanges. My application then has to know about this and take
measures to avoid duplicate handling (duplicate handling is still
better than no handling, though).

It sounds like I should perhaps investigate mirrored queues with
autoheal instead.

(the intended setup is two nodes with varying network conditions -
not always datacenter-quality - and fully automated operation)

Regards

Antoine.

Hi. I tested your ini file. With indenting, it produced exactly the 
error message you posted. Without indenting, it works.

Michael, thanks for reply!

i think the last solution (queue-declare with passive bit set on and
checking consumers count in declare-ok)
is good for me.

Hi,
We are using federation setup with two URIs defined in an upstream, as suggested by you. I simulated link failure by closing one of the Ethernet port. I observed that it takes around 15-20 minutes to switch link. Why is it taking this much time? Is there a way I can decrease the switch time?

One more question: on the same setup, I stopped RabbitMQ server on downstream and started it after few seconds. Sometimes the messages published to upstream exchange during that duration are lost. Though, they were present in the upstream queue during that period, but lost after the downstream broker was started.

Thanks,
Punit

It should switch as soon as the "old" AMQP connection goes down - so 
check your heartbeat settings.

Hmm.

Of course that shouldn't be happening. How do you know they are lost? In 
particular, it's possible for the downstream bindings to change while a 
link is down, in which case messages can be queued on the upstream, then 
when the link comes back they get transferred over and then dropped. 
Could something like that be happening? The tracer might be helpful to 
see if these messages are indeed getting published downstream.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Can't Bind After Upgrading from 3.1.1 to 3.1.5
Message-ID: <CAHEpgBDSJYrjocFPxbcoehu1n_JtD7MLXtn9QK8tyeiYKMn8iQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello RabbitMQ gurus,

After upgrading a customer site from RabbitMQ 3.1.1 to 3.1.5 (on RHEL 6.2),
we had a few durable queues that did not seem to be working correctly (they
weren't receiving any messages).  It should be noted that this is a cluster
of 5 servers with queue mirroring set to exactly 2 nodes.

During troubleshooting, we deleted and recreated the queues.  After
creating the queues, we attempted to rebind them to the exchange (in the
web management GUI), but this always failed.

[In the following example, names have been changed to protect the
innocent].  After attempting to bind durable mirrored 'my.queue' to durable
direct exchange 'my.exchange' using routing key 'my.queue' (in vhost
'abc'), we get the following error:

NOT_FOUND - no binding my.queue between exchange 'my.exchange' in vhost
> 'abc' and queue 'my.queue' in vhost 'abc'


This behavior in the web console confirms the behavior we see when trying
to bind programmatically in our app (we get an AMQP 404 error).

Here is the kicker-- if we change the routing key by just one character, it
works flawlessly!  Or if we don't change anything, but add "foo=bar" to the
binding arguments, it also works!  So it seems that because we did this
binding in the past, and it was somehow corrupted, it won't allow us to
re-bind with the same arguments now.  As noted above, even after deleting
and re-creating the queue, it still won't let us do that one binding we
need.

Is there any way we can fix this easily without interrupting the customer
too much?  Or is it likely we will have to wipe mnesia on all the nodes and
rebuild the cluster (my fear is that this may be the only way)?

Is there anything I can or should do on my end to further debug /
investigate?

Thanks for your help!

-Chris

Can you post actual routing keys you use (both that do not work and do work)
and create a script that can reproduce your issue?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] clustered ram node loosing its membership
	without being reset
Message-ID: <CAAxCTjQ0uerhKXjf50oKnP82bkjWOZoW7EXn9MXKaM980Ti9yA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I think this is a bug - but if it's an intended behavior, I cannot get
the rationale behind it:

I have a cluster with 2 nodes, node01 disc based and node02 ram based.
I have clustered them. Then after shutting down both, rebooting node02 it
starts in standalone mode.
Booting node01, it fails saying that node02 is no longer in cluster with
it: I would expect this behavior only in case I had explicitly reset
node02, but that is not the case: booting the RAM node without its peer let
it loose its membership - that's seems quite odd to me.

IMHO a more reasonable behavior would be that node02, when started with
node01 being down, not being able to find any reference peer, and being ram
based, should just fail.

Can you confirm this is a bug, or if the intended behavior, what is the
rationale?

RabbitMQ version is 3.1.5

Thanks,
   Sigismondo

Hi Michael,

I don't think it is easily reproducible.  We haven't run into this with any
of our upgrade tests or at other customer sites.  So... I wouldn't know how
to create a script that reproduces the problem.

If it is helpful to have the actual queue, routing key, and exchange names,
then here you go (they actually aren't that special-- not sure why I
censored them the first time):
Queue: mail.global.v0.requests
RoutingKey: mail.global.v0.requests
Exchange: Local.Requests

This happened with two queues.  There are about 10 other durable queues
with similar names/keys (and the same exchange) that do not have this
problem.

That happens when the binding in question exists but the 'home' node of 
the (durable) queue is not alive. In case of a mirrored queue that would 
imply that all mirrors are down. Essentially both the queue and 
associated bindings are in a limbo state at that point - they neither 
exist nor do they not exist.

So when you see the above error, please check whether the queue you are 
binding actually exists, i.e. shows up in 'rabbitmqctl list_queues'. If 
it does not then you are seeing normal behaviour. Otherwise there's a bug.

Regards,

Matthias.

Do you remember in what order the nodes were restarted? During full cluster restarts,
RabbitMQ currently requires that the node that was shut down last needs to be started first.

Hi Matthias,

According to "rabbitmqctl cluster_status" and the management web console,
all 5 nodes were up in the cluster (with no partitions).  In addition, I
could see the queue in the web management console-- and successfully
deleted and re-created the queue too.  I also could successfully create
other bindings against the same queue and exchange.

I did not try "rabbitmqctl list_qeueus" (and don't have access to the
system right now to try it).  Still, I would think that successfully
deleting and creating the queue in the management console would indicate
the queue should be alive and on an online node.

If this is in fact a bug, is there anything you can recommend to get it
into a better state?

-Chris

But was that *always* the case? Would be good to see the logs all the 
way from the time of the upgrade.

Yes, that should be the case.

Hard to know without understanding what the problem is. Is this
reproducible at all? e.g. do you have a queue *now* that is suffering
from this behaviour?

Hi Matthias,

I can try to get the logs.  Of course, during the upgrade nodes went up and
down...  So there could have been a time when the nodes the queue was on
were both down.  But this continued even after all nodes were back up and
the queue was recreated.

It is very reproducible now on this specific customer system (we haven't
yet resolved it there since I was hoping for an option that doesn't include
clearing mnesia or resetting the nodes).  So, yes, I can make the binding
fail all I want on that system.  I cannot, however, get the bug to
reproduce on any other systems.

Thanks again,
Chris

Right. I want to check the logs for anything unusual.

In which case please post the output of 'rabbitmqctl report' from one of 
the nodes, and a screenshot of the management UI when you get the 
NOT_FOUND error.

Fill it with messages

Then restart the server towards the end of the 24 hour period.

Can I expect the messages to be purged at the end of the original 24 hour

Im using 2.8.4 and it seems the TTL is reapplied after a restart? Can

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Fine-grained LDAP access to resources
Message-ID: <fcf6bdee-28de-4b0f-ba2f-8a29a03cc1ed@googlegroups.com>

Hello,

I'm in the process of configuring RabbitMQ to leverage LDAP. I have it 
configured and working but I'm now looking to lock down the access using a 
finer grain. Right now I'm doing this for resource control:

{permission, configure,
  {for, [
     {resource, queue,
         {in_group, "CN=rmq-${vhost}-queue,OU=xxx,OU=xxx,DC=xxx,DC=xxx"}}]}}

Using this method, anyone in a matching group can create any queue anywhere 
inside the vhost. What I'd like is to provide them access to create queues 
only with a specific prefix based on group name.

It seems you could kind of do this by using CN=rmq-${vhost}-${name}-queue 
but that would expand to the full resource name and would require multiple 
ldap groups for every single object in the vhost which quickly becomes 
maintainable and non dynamic.

I'm wondering if there's some way I could get functionality similar to 
{in_group, CN=rmq-${vhost}-${prefix}-queue} where ${prefix} is the first 
token in a period delimited string.

Any thoughts?

Thank you,
James M.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Problems with RabbitMQ installlation and startup
Message-ID: <523CCA44.1090300@irisat.mx>

Good morning/afternoon/evening to all.

This email is to request some feedback with regards as to what could be 
possibly wrong with a RabbitMQ
installation in Debian 6.0, specifically with the startup script or 
which issue is not allowing the program to
run, even tough if run without the script it works.

The install is done this way:
1. You install the package rabbitmq-server_2.8.4-1_all.deb with dpkg -i.
2. It installs but it warns you about a dependency for ernang-nox, this 
was solved by doing>
apt-get -f install which in turn downloaded all of the packages for 
Erlang. The server started
and there was no issue until now.
3. If you install the package, here what it brings out:
Selecting previously deselected package rabbitmq-server.
(Reading database ... 33486 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking rabbitmq-server (from rabbitmq-server_2.8.4-1_all.deb) ...
Setting up rabbitmq-server (2.8.4-1) ...
Adding group `rabbitmq' (GID 106) ...

dpkg: error processing rabbitmq-server (--install):
  subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1
Processing triggers for man-db ...
Errors were encountered while processing:
  rabbitmq-server

The startup script brings out this error:
/usr/lib/rabbitmq/bin/rabbitmq-server: line 90: 10492 Segmentation 
fault  erl -pa "$RABBITMQ_EBIN_ROOT" -noinput -hidden -s 
rabbit_prelaunch -sname rabbitmqprelaunch$$ -extra 
"$RABBITMQ_ENABLED_PLUGINS_FILE" "$RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_DIR" 
"${RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_EXPAND_DIR}" "${RABBITMQ_NODENAME}"

If we venture to run the erl line:
erl -pa "$RABBITMQ_EBIN_ROOT" -noinput -hidden -s rabbit_prelaunch 
-sname rabbitmqprelaunch$$ -extra "$RABBITMQ_ENABLED_PLUGINS_FILE" 
"$RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_DIR" "${RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_EXPAND_DIR}" 
"${RABBITMQ_NODENAME}"

This brings out:
{"init terminating in 
do_boot",{undef,[{rabbit_prelaunch,start,[]},{init,start_it,1},{init,start_em,1}]}}

Crash dump was written to: erl_crash.dump
  init terminating in do_boot ()
And this generated the dump attached.

One thing to mention is that the scripts /etc/init.d/rabbit-mqserver and 
/usr/sbin/rabbit-mqserver give the same error.
However, interestingly enough, if you run 
/usr/lib/rabbitmq/bin/rabbitmq-server:

I'm not sure why the init script segfaults while running erl directly doesn't but the issue
seems to be with rabbit_prelaunch not being on code path.

I'd recommend giving RabbitMQ's own Debian repository a try:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html

You will get a recent version (3.1), for which it will be easier to get
support here compared to 2.8.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Questiong about plugins and clustering
Message-ID: <CAMcAHLXdmoS3y8rENhohaSSFkLrX-Ay-=2Sgxmi07ByUhDDYPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is there a way for a plugin to know when a node joins or leaves the
cluster?

Is there any notification that can be received by my plugin about this
event happening or I need to poll Mnesia once in a while?

I see there's rabbit_node_monitor:notify_joined_cluster/0 but that's
doesn't seem to help me.

Regards,

Alvaro

I have just tried shutting down node02 last: I can confirm that when
rebooted first, it starts "unclustered".

I think the second time here when you call rabbitmq-server - detached, you
need to have stopped RabbitMQ before, else you are trying to start two
RabbitMQ's at the same time.

After you enable the plugins you need to run:

rabbitmqctl stop

And then start the server by calling: rabbitmq-server - detached

Alvaro

Hi Team ,

             I have installed rabbitmq 3.1.5 with erlang 15B02 and i
am facing lot of issues .
First started rabbtimq-server -detached without plugins working fine
and if enabled all plugins including  jsonrpcchannel then it 's not
working .

Do you have any specific reason on this version ?

note : i have stopped the rabbit service after plugins were enabled
and this issue appear during next start up..

1 . rabbitmq-server -detached  command giving following warning  messages ..

Warning: PID file not written; -detached was passed.


2. Rabbitmq.config  , please correct me the format is correct ?

[ {rabbit, [{disk_free_limit, 5000000000}]},

         {rabbit, [{vm_memory_high_watermark, 0.4}]} ].



3. is there any order need follow for 3.1.5 version to enable plugins
using enable-plugins file .






I can able to enable these much plugins only ..

Good day everybody ,
Let's say I need to use rabbitmq for a work queue for a production environment I am using a java producer and a php consumer .
Naturally my php code sits on the web server ,looking at the examples online we need to run the consumers separately on a command line e.g worker.php in two different consoles (based on the amount if workers/consumers we want to listen for messages ), how do I make my php consumers work without running them on a command-line to listen to producer messages ?

Yes, but when the federation link is up, messages will be duplicated
accross exchanges. My application then has to know about this and take
measures to avoid duplicate handling (duplicate handling is still
better than no handling, though).

It sounds like I should perhaps investigate mirrored queues with
autoheal instead.

(the intended setup is two nodes with varying network conditions -
not always datacenter-quality - and fully automated operation)

Regards

Antoine.

Hi. I tested your ini file. With indenting, it produced exactly the 
error message you posted. Without indenting, it works.

Michael, thanks for reply!

i think the last solution (queue-declare with passive bit set on and
checking consumers count in declare-ok)
is good for me.

Hi,
We are using federation setup with two URIs defined in an upstream, as suggested by you. I simulated link failure by closing one of the Ethernet port. I observed that it takes around 15-20 minutes to switch link. Why is it taking this much time? Is there a way I can decrease the switch time?

One more question: on the same setup, I stopped RabbitMQ server on downstream and started it after few seconds. Sometimes the messages published to upstream exchange during that duration are lost. Though, they were present in the upstream queue during that period, but lost after the downstream broker was started.

Thanks,
Punit

It should switch as soon as the "old" AMQP connection goes down - so 
check your heartbeat settings.

Hmm.

Of course that shouldn't be happening. How do you know they are lost? In 
particular, it's possible for the downstream bindings to change while a 
link is down, in which case messages can be queued on the upstream, then 
when the link comes back they get transferred over and then dropped. 
Could something like that be happening? The tracer might be helpful to 
see if these messages are indeed getting published downstream.

Cheers, Simon

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Can't Bind After Upgrading from 3.1.1 to
	3.1.5
To: Discussions about RabbitMQ <rabbitmq-discuss at lists.rabbitmq.com>
Message-ID:
	<CAHEpgBDSJYrjocFPxbcoehu1n_JtD7MLXtn9QK8tyeiYKMn8iQ at mail.gmail.com>

Hello RabbitMQ gurus,

After upgrading a customer site from RabbitMQ 3.1.1 to 3.1.5 (on RHEL 6.2),
we had a few durable queues that did not seem to be working correctly (they
weren't receiving any messages).  It should be noted that this is a cluster
of 5 servers with queue mirroring set to exactly 2 nodes.

During troubleshooting, we deleted and recreated the queues.  After
creating the queues, we attempted to rebind them to the exchange (in the
web management GUI), but this always failed.

[In the following example, names have been changed to protect the
innocent].  After attempting to bind durable mirrored 'my.queue' to durable
direct exchange 'my.exchange' using routing key 'my.queue' (in vhost
'abc'), we get the following error:

NOT_FOUND - no binding my.queue between exchange 'my.exchange' in vhost
> 'abc' and queue 'my.queue' in vhost 'abc'


This behavior in the web console confirms the behavior we see when trying
to bind programmatically in our app (we get an AMQP 404 error).

Here is the kicker-- if we change the routing key by just one character, it
works flawlessly!  Or if we don't change anything, but add "foo=bar" to the
binding arguments, it also works!  So it seems that because we did this
binding in the past, and it was somehow corrupted, it won't allow us to
re-bind with the same arguments now.  As noted above, even after deleting
and re-creating the queue, it still won't let us do that one binding we
need.

Is there any way we can fix this easily without interrupting the customer
too much?  Or is it likely we will have to wipe mnesia on all the nodes and
rebuild the cluster (my fear is that this may be the only way)?

Is there anything I can or should do on my end to further debug /
investigate?

Thanks for your help!

-Chris

Can you post actual routing keys you use (both that do not work and do work)
and create a script that can reproduce your issue?

Hi, I think this is a bug - but if it's an intended behavior, I cannot get
the rationale behind it:

I have a cluster with 2 nodes, node01 disc based and node02 ram based.
I have clustered them. Then after shutting down both, rebooting node02 it
starts in standalone mode.
Booting node01, it fails saying that node02 is no longer in cluster with
it: I would expect this behavior only in case I had explicitly reset
node02, but that is not the case: booting the RAM node without its peer let
it loose its membership - that's seems quite odd to me.

IMHO a more reasonable behavior would be that node02, when started with
node01 being down, not being able to find any reference peer, and being ram
based, should just fail.

Can you confirm this is a bug, or if the intended behavior, what is the
rationale?

RabbitMQ version is 3.1.5

Thanks,
   Sigismondo

Hi Michael,

I don't think it is easily reproducible.  We haven't run into this with any
of our upgrade tests or at other customer sites.  So... I wouldn't know how
to create a script that reproduces the problem.

If it is helpful to have the actual queue, routing key, and exchange names,
then here you go (they actually aren't that special-- not sure why I
censored them the first time):
Queue: mail.global.v0.requests
RoutingKey: mail.global.v0.requests
Exchange: Local.Requests

This happened with two queues.  There are about 10 other durable queues
with similar names/keys (and the same exchange) that do not have this
problem.

That happens when the binding in question exists but the 'home' node of 
the (durable) queue is not alive. In case of a mirrored queue that would 
imply that all mirrors are down. Essentially both the queue and 
associated bindings are in a limbo state at that point - they neither 
exist nor do they not exist.

So when you see the above error, please check whether the queue you are 
binding actually exists, i.e. shows up in 'rabbitmqctl list_queues'. If 
it does not then you are seeing normal behaviour. Otherwise there's a bug.

Regards,

Matthias.

Do you remember in what order the nodes were restarted? During full cluster restarts,
RabbitMQ currently requires that the node that was shut down last needs to be started first.

Hi Matthias,

According to "rabbitmqctl cluster_status" and the management web console,
all 5 nodes were up in the cluster (with no partitions).  In addition, I
could see the queue in the web management console-- and successfully
deleted and re-created the queue too.  I also could successfully create
other bindings against the same queue and exchange.

I did not try "rabbitmqctl list_qeueus" (and don't have access to the
system right now to try it).  Still, I would think that successfully
deleting and creating the queue in the management console would indicate
the queue should be alive and on an online node.

If this is in fact a bug, is there anything you can recommend to get it
into a better state?

-Chris

But was that *always* the case? Would be good to see the logs all the 
way from the time of the upgrade.

Yes, that should be the case.

Hard to know without understanding what the problem is. Is this
reproducible at all? e.g. do you have a queue *now* that is suffering
from this behaviour?

Hi Matthias,

I can try to get the logs.  Of course, during the upgrade nodes went up and
down...  So there could have been a time when the nodes the queue was on
were both down.  But this continued even after all nodes were back up and
the queue was recreated.

It is very reproducible now on this specific customer system (we haven't
yet resolved it there since I was hoping for an option that doesn't include
clearing mnesia or resetting the nodes).  So, yes, I can make the binding
fail all I want on that system.  I cannot, however, get the bug to
reproduce on any other systems.

Thanks again,
Chris

Right. I want to check the logs for anything unusual.

In which case please post the output of 'rabbitmqctl report' from one of 
the nodes, and a screenshot of the management UI when you get the

period still, or another 24 hours from the time the server restarts?

Im using 2.8.4 and it seems the TTL is reapplied after a restart? Can 
anyone confirm if that is by design? Or changed in latest version.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Fine-grained LDAP access to resources
To: rabbitmq-discuss at googlegroups.com
Message-ID: <fcf6bdee-28de-4b0f-ba2f-8a29a03cc1ed at googlegroups.com>

Hello,

I'm in the process of configuring RabbitMQ to leverage LDAP. I have it 
configured and working but I'm now looking to lock down the access using a 
finer grain. Right now I'm doing this for resource control:

{permission, configure,
  {for, [
     {resource, queue,
         {in_group, "CN=rmq-${vhost}-queue,OU=xxx,OU=xxx,DC=xxx,DC=xxx"}}]}}

Using this method, anyone in a matching group can create any queue anywhere 
inside the vhost. What I'd like is to provide them access to create queues 
only with a specific prefix based on group name.

It seems you could kind of do this by using CN=rmq-${vhost}-${name}-queue 
but that would expand to the full resource name and would require multiple 
ldap groups for every single object in the vhost which quickly becomes 
maintainable and non dynamic.

I'm wondering if there's some way I could get functionality similar to 
{in_group, CN=rmq-${vhost}-${prefix}-queue} where ${prefix} is the first 
token in a period delimited string.

Any thoughts?

Thank you,
James M.

Fixed since 2.8.6.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Problems with RabbitMQ installlation and
	startup
To: rabbitmq-discuss at lists.rabbitmq.com

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"; Format="flowed"

Good morning/afternoon/evening to all.

This email is to request some feedback with regards as to what could be 
possibly wrong with a RabbitMQ
installation in Debian 6.0, specifically with the startup script or 
which issue is not allowing the program to
run, even tough if run without the script it works.

The install is done this way:
1. You install the package rabbitmq-server_2.8.4-1_all.deb with dpkg -i.
2. It installs but it warns you about a dependency for ernang-nox, this 
was solved by doing>
apt-get -f install which in turn downloaded all of the packages for 
Erlang. The server started
and there was no issue until now.
3. If you install the package, here what it brings out:
Selecting previously deselected package rabbitmq-server.
(Reading database ... 33486 files and directories currently installed.)
Unpacking rabbitmq-server (from rabbitmq-server_2.8.4-1_all.deb) ...
Setting up rabbitmq-server (2.8.4-1) ...
Adding group `rabbitmq' (GID 106) ...
Done.
Adding system user `rabbitmq' (UID 103) ...
Adding new user `rabbitmq' (UID 103) with group `rabbitmq' ...
Not creating home directory `/var/lib/rabbitmq'.
Starting message broker: rabbitmq-serverFAILED - check 
/var/log/rabbitmq/startup_\{log, _err\} ... (warning).
  failed!
invoke-rc.d: initscript rabbitmq-server, action "start" failed.
dpkg: error processing rabbitmq-server (--install):
  subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1
Processing triggers for man-db ...
Errors were encountered while processing:
  rabbitmq-server

The startup script brings out this error:
/usr/lib/rabbitmq/bin/rabbitmq-server: line 90: 10492 Segmentation 
fault  erl -pa "$RABBITMQ_EBIN_ROOT" -noinput -hidden -s 
rabbit_prelaunch -sname rabbitmqprelaunch$$ -extra 
"$RABBITMQ_ENABLED_PLUGINS_FILE" "$RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_DIR" 
"${RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_EXPAND_DIR}" "${RABBITMQ_NODENAME}"

If we venture to run the erl line:
erl -pa "$RABBITMQ_EBIN_ROOT" -noinput -hidden -s rabbit_prelaunch 
-sname rabbitmqprelaunch$$ -extra "$RABBITMQ_ENABLED_PLUGINS_FILE" 
"$RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_DIR" "${RABBITMQ_PLUGINS_EXPAND_DIR}" 
"${RABBITMQ_NODENAME}"

This brings out:
{"init terminating in 
do_boot",{undef,[{rabbit_prelaunch,start,[]},{init,start_it,1},{init,start_em,1}]}}

Crash dump was written to: erl_crash.dump
  init terminating in do_boot ()
And this generated the dump attached.

One thing to mention is that the scripts /etc/init.d/rabbit-mqserver and 
/usr/sbin/rabbit-mqserver give the same error.
However, interestingly enough, if you run 
/usr/lib/rabbitmq/bin/rabbitmq-server:

broker running

It works! What could be wrong with the startup scripts? I attach them 
also to see
if there's something there that could be useful.

Your help would be most appreciated.

TIA,
Allan

I'm not sure why the init script segfaults while running erl directly doesn't but the issue
seems to be with rabbit_prelaunch not being on code path.

I'd recommend giving RabbitMQ's own Debian repository a try:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html

You will get a recent version (3.1), for which it will be easier to get
support here compared to 2.8.

Hi,

Is there a way for a plugin to know when a node joins or leaves the
cluster?

Is there any notification that can be received by my plugin about this
event happening or I need to poll Mnesia once in a while?

I see there's rabbit_node_monitor:notify_joined_cluster/0 but that's
doesn't seem to help me.

Regards,

Alvaro

Sir/Madam,
                 This is for first time I am using RabbitMQ. After
searching, I come to know that first I have to install RabbitMq sever and
after doing that I used a code sample given in rabbitMq's official site.I
am pasting that code here also. I also tried to search the resolution of
this error but I am not able to get it's solution. This is a request to
please help me as soon as it can br possible.

Actually, the problem is that createConnection() method is throwing an
exception and the exception is "BrokerUnreachableException was Unhandled".

Please HELP ASAP.

Thanks.

Hello All,

I would like to federate all messages to the default unnamed queue - is
this possible?  I have tried variations of pattern matching nothing, but
believe I'll need to alter my publishing behaviour.  True or false?

Thanks in advance,

Sukhjeet,

Can you please be a bit more specific about

 * What the stack trace look like
 * How did you install RabbitMQ
 * If it is running
 * If there's anything in the log
 * What tutorial are you following and for what language

Then it will be much easier to provide specific advice.

MK

It's the default exchange that is "unnamed" (clients specify an empty string to refer to it).
Queue federation will be supposed in the next release (3.2). Are you talking about
exchanges?

>  I have tried variations of pattern matching nothing, but believe I'll need to alter my publishing behaviour.

It should be possible to federate any exchange, as far as I know. Can you post some specific
federation configuration examples and you code, and explain what your queues and bindings
setup is?

Hi,

If by "unnamed queue" you mean the default exchange with no name, then no,
you can't federate that exchange.

Alvaro

What do you mean by this? You can just run the PHP consumer directly on the
webserver process, although I wouldn't recommend doing that since you would
end up blocking all the server threads.

Is there a reason why you don't want to run the consumer from the command
line directly?

I think it was set to default value which is 600. I changed it to 30 seconds on upstream.
Now it detects the failure in around a minute and changes the link.

This behavior was observed when both links were up, but we just stopped and started the downstream broker. 
Bindings were not changed, there was only one queue listening to downstream stream with '#' routing key.
I will use tracer when I observe this next time.

No, not at the moment. Currently we just ask Mnesia whenever we need to 
know.

Well, you can invoke rabbit_mnesia:cluster_nodes(running) or 
rabbit_mnesia:cluster_nodes(all) or whatever.

No, that's the other way round - used to tell the node monitor that a 
node has joined.

What are you trying to do?

As Alvaro pointed out, it's any exchange other than the default exchange 
(since the "default exchange" really just means "publish to queue").

I'll update the documentation to make this clearer.

The clue's in the name. The broker was not reachable. Catch the 
exception to find out more, but I would bet that you haven't pointed the 
ConnectionFactory at the broker.

Hi Alvaro,

A plugin could subscribe to Mnesia system events that will report when
Mnesia stops and starts on nodes:
 http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/Mnesia_chap5.html#id76679

Depending on the kind of plugin you are writing you could use the
information sent to the log exchange (amq.rabbitmq.log) to determine
when nodes leave and join.

The consumer is publishing the response to the 'logs' exchange with a '' 
routing key, whereas...

...the producer is expecting replies on an exclusive, server-named queue.

Clearly that isn't going to work. And because the 'logs' exchange is 
also the exchange on which the consumer queue is bound you end up with 
the 'infinite loop' at the consumer since the response published by the 
consumer will be consumed by the consumer!

You need to change your consumer to publish the response to the default 
exchange ('') with the routing_key taken from props.reply_to of the request.

The main difference in starting in these two ways is that the server is 
run as root in the latter case, rather than the "rabbitmq" user. The 
failed startup also failed due to "undef" - i.e. the Erlang VM could not 
find the definition for a module.

I therefore wonder if the permissions of the server code have been 
changed somehow so that the "rabbitmq" user can't read it. If so, the 
easiest way to fix the permissions is probably to remove the deb and 
reinstall it.

Thanks alvaro like I said this concept is totally new to me , however I would like to know if the consumers would run stand alone , that is apart from the web server ? , if that is the case does it mean I would have to keep my command line open always on my servers?

Sir/Madam,
                 This is for first time I am using RabbitMQ. After
searching, I come to know that first I have to install RabbitMq sever and
after doing that I used a code sample given in rabbitMq's official site.I
am pasting that code here also. I also tried to search the resolution of
this error but I am not able to get it's solution. This is a request to
please help me as soon as it can br possible.

Actually, the problem is that createConnection() method is throwing an
exception and the exception is "BrokerUnreachableException was Unhandled".

Please HELP ASAP.

Thanks.

Hello All,

I would like to federate all messages to the default unnamed queue - is
this possible?  I have tried variations of pattern matching nothing, but
believe I'll need to alter my publishing behaviour.  True or false?

Thanks in advance,

Greg

Sukhjeet,

Can you please be a bit more specific about

 * What the stack trace look like
 * How did you install RabbitMQ
 * If it is running
 * If there's anything in the log
 * What tutorial are you following and for what language

Then it will be much easier to provide specific advice.

MK

It's the default exchange that is "unnamed" (clients specify an empty string to refer to it).
Queue federation will be supposed in the next release (3.2). Are you talking about
exchanges?

>  I have tried variations of pattern matching nothing, but believe I'll need to alter my publishing behaviour.

It should be possible to federate any exchange, as far as I know. Can you post some specific
federation configuration examples and you code, and explain what your queues and bindings
setup is?

Hi,

If by "unnamed queue" you mean the default exchange with no name, then no,
you can't federate that exchange.

What do you mean by this? You can just run the PHP consumer directly on the
webserver process, although I wouldn't recommend doing that since you would
end up blocking all the server threads.

Is there a reason why you don't want to run the consumer from the command
line directly?

Alvaro

I think it was set to default value which is 600. I changed it to 30 seconds on upstream.
Now it detects the failure in around a minute and changes the link.

This behavior was observed when both links were up, but we just stopped and started the downstream broker. 
Bindings were not changed, there was only one queue listening to downstream stream with '#' routing key.
I will use tracer when I observe this next time.

No, not at the moment. Currently we just ask Mnesia whenever we need to 
know.

Well, you can invoke rabbit_mnesia:cluster_nodes(running) or 
rabbit_mnesia:cluster_nodes(all) or whatever.

No, that's the other way round - used to tell the node monitor that a 
node has joined.

What are you trying to do?

As Alvaro pointed out, it's any exchange other than the default exchange 
(since the "default exchange" really just means "publish to queue").

I'll update the documentation to make this clearer.

The clue's in the name. The broker was not reachable. Catch the 
exception to find out more, but I would bet that you haven't pointed the 
ConnectionFactory at the broker.

Hi Alvaro,

A plugin could subscribe to Mnesia system events that will report when
Mnesia stops and starts on nodes:
 http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/Mnesia_chap5.html#id76679

Depending on the kind of plugin you are writing you could use the
information sent to the log exchange (amq.rabbitmq.log) to determine
when nodes leave and join.

The consumer is publishing the response to the 'logs' exchange with a '' 
routing key, whereas...

...the producer is expecting replies on an exclusive, server-named queue.

Clearly that isn't going to work. And because the 'logs' exchange is 
also the exchange on which the consumer queue is bound you end up with 
the 'infinite loop' at the consumer since the response published by the 
consumer will be consumed by the consumer!

You need to change your consumer to publish the response to the default 
exchange ('') with the routing_key taken from props.reply_to of the request.

Matthias.

Yes. PHP environment is reset between requests, this does not work very

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Many consumers on 1 queue. What algorithm
 RabbitMQ use to send messages?
Message-ID: <1379930405578-29831.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi there!

For example, I have 3 consumers on 1 queue.
If I set prefetch_count = 1, then server will use round-robin algorithm:
1st message to consumer1
2nd message to consumer2
3rd message to consumer3
4th message to consumer1 and so on.

But how does strategy changes when prefetch_count !=1? (for example 10)
Will server push 10 messages to consumer1, next 10 to 2 and so on?

And if prefetch_count = 1 but 1st consumer has already processed his
message? Will server send new message again to consumer1? Or in any cases
next message will be sent to consumer2?

It's round robin between consumers that haven't gone above the basic.qos
setting
for their channel. With prefetch > 1 it's just harder to see because you
have more
messages in flight.

Message-ID: <CAAc6ZR-WMup1miiMuLQTEsCLpe+v3Nzc8yZfYQNi+N0vuMdTfA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

Are channel best practices for connected RabbitMQ clients published
anywhere? I understand the threading limitations, that channels should not
be shared between threads. Does the channel concept exist only to support
multi-threaded applications, or does it have some other purpose?

If I marshal all calls to a channel onto a single thread in my application
code, is there any problem with simply maintaining a single channel for all
declares, publishes and consumes?

Additional questions:

1. Should each basic consume be invoked on a dedicated channel?

2. Do I need to basic.ack on the same channel on which I invoked
basic.consume?

Many thanks
Mike

Yes, rabbitmq_jsonrpc_channel is broken in 3.1.5 I'm afraid. It will be 
fixed in the next release.

It was added to avoid having N TCP connections from the same client in case
it needs to have multiple logical connections.

Should be fine.

If you want to have N consumers from the same OS process, it's not strictly
necessary.

You must ack/nack/reject on the same channel the delivery was on because
delivery_tag is
scoped per channel.

A good reason to use more than one channel is error handling, which in many
cases is per-channel.
For example, if you expect an exception for one operation that you can
recover from, you can use
a separate channel to make sure the connection closure caused by the
exception does not affect other operations in the same VM.

No, it's a bug. I'm sure it used to work the way you describe.

The channel concept exists (in AMQP) to provide a lightweight alternative to having one TCP connection per client, since the latter are resource intensive (to both client and server's detriment). Multiplexing multiple "clients" over a single TCP connection turns out to be a fairly common approach amongst network intensive applications. Channels also provide a unit of atomicity with regards message ordering, i.e., messages are always fully (FIFO) ordered from client to server over a single channel, whereas there are no ordering guarantees regarding messages concurrently sent (or delivered) over multiple channels.

One problem you might run into relates to the answer I've given below about correlating ACKs with the correct channel.

That's not strictly necessary, though neither is it wrong. Depending on your application logic, you might find that introduces unnecessary overhead (in terms of threads and associated synchronisation primitives used in the client and/or additional resource use on the server), so if I were you I would only do it if it is (a) necessary or (b) significantly simplifies your client code. Remember that a channel provides a FIFO ordering guarantee, so having multiple consumers on a single channel means that you're potentially dealing with messages from more than one source queue, in which case you might inadvertently introduce a serial bottleneck.

Yes, that is absolutely necessary. An ACK sent on another channel to the one on which the delivery was received will be treated as a channel error.

That doesn't exist at the moment, no.

Hmm, we almost want some equivalent of the JSP-EL there. Oh god, another

Thanks Michael, Tim. great answers.

One more channel question:

You shouldn't share a channel between multiple threads, but given that an
ACK should be sent on the same channel that the delivery is received mean
that one _must_ violate this rule? I call basic.consume on my application
thread, but basic.deliver will be called on the client library's internal
message loop thread and then the ACK will no doubt be called on a separate
application thread (where I de-queue the message from my queuing consumer).
Is this violation of the do-not-use-channels-on-multiple-threads rule OK?

Thanks
Mike

If you run one consumer per thread, use a new channel for every one of them.

http://qdb.io/

This version adds filtering on routing key and/or grep on the message
body. Filtering is available on the list messages endpoint and
outputs.

# Fetch messages containing a line starting with a number
# The -g option to curl stops it from messing with [] and {}
# The %2b is the + character url encoded
$ curl -g "http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?grep=^[0-9]%2b"

# Fetch messages with routingKey matching a RabbitMQ expression

$ curl "http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?routingKey=foo.*.%23"

# Fetch messages with routingKey matching a Java regular expression
$ curl -g "http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?routingKey=/^[0-9]%2b/"

Some output examples:

# The %2b is the + character url encoded
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/foo/out/rabbit -d from=10:20 -d grep=^[0-9]%2b

I want to have a plugin that works with a concept of topics and partitioned
queues. What does this mean?

I want to create a topic called "my_topic" which implies having a
consistent hash exchange (CHE) called "my_topic" + one queue called
"node_name.my_topic" bound to the my_topic exchange. The queue message
contents should live in the "node_name" node.

Whenever a node joins the cluster, I want to automatically declare a queue
called "new_node.my_topic" and bind it to the "my_topic" CHE. That queue
will be declared on new_node, so the message contents would end up in that
node.

With this I want to achieve some sort of "partitioned queues".

I plan this plugin to be an extension to the management plugin, so one
would create one of these topics via an HTTP call.

Also when connecting to a broker, one could ask this plugin via HTTP to
send the proper queue name for a particular topic, in order to consume from
it.

Does this makes sense?

Thanks for the clarification Simon. This feature would be a huge benefit
for us. The way it stands now, if someone wants access isolation within a
vhost, we have to spin up a new vhost and then create shovels if they need
to intercommunicate.

I took a shot at modifying and compiling the ldap plugin and came up with a
seemingly working solution. I'm just getting my feet wet with Erlang but
does this have any glaring issues at first glance? I'm basically adding a
new derived value to the Args list so that when it's sent to fill()
${prefix} is properly expanded.

https://gist.github.com/jmcle/2b91d991c9a163ec9d37/revisions

My follow up question would be, what are the chances of getting something
similar to this added to the official code base?

Thanks,
James

Message-ID: <2C43E142-1836-48A4-BA00-273643BB1133@dushin.net>

Hi folks,

I was wondering why we don't support the connection_timeout amqp_params_network parameter in the amqp_uri:parse functions.

It seems to boil down to:

parse_amqp_param(Field, String) when Field =:= channel_max orelse
                                  Field =:= frame_max   orelse
                                  Field =:= heartbeat   ->
 try return(list_to_integer(String))
 catch error:badarg -> fail({not_an_integer, String})
 end;
parse_amqp_param(Field, String) ->
 fail({parameter_unconfigurable_in_query, Field, String}).


Would it be possible to add connection_timeout to the guard expression?

Thanks!

-Fred

What do you mean by "use rabbitmq in multiple users"? You could have 
your application connect to the RabbitMQ broker with a single user and 
enforce permissions itself; many applications do this.

Or you could use RabbitMQ access control: see 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html

Based on a quick look at the code, nothing is too wrong from a low level 
point of view. However, this is wrong:

case Predicate of
     true  -> Var = Something;
     false -> Var = SomethingElse
end,

since although Var happens to escape the inner scope in all cases, it's 
not very clear and modern Erlang compilers will complain. Instead you want:

Var = case Predicate of
           true  -> Something;
           false -> SomethingElse

However, I'd be reluctant to merge this; conceptually it's very specific 
to your use case - what if you want to match something other than up to 
the first '.'? What if you want to do that on something other than the 
resource name?

Really you want to be able to write something like ${name.prefix('.')}. 
That is (obviously) much more complicated though.

It's possible some half-way house could exist between these two 
extremes; if so I can't immediately think of it.

Cheers, Simon

Thanks for the feedback. You're right, the compiler didn't complain but
your way does makes more sense. I've updated the gist to reflect the
changes if anyone is following along.

As for use case specificity, I can see your point. Although, I'm struggling
to come up with a case where you would want to use a tokenized version of
anything other than name. Assuming name is the only thing that makes sense
you could potentially have a new attribute called 'prefix_delimiter' which
would be sent to the tokens function. If you wanted to add more
customization there could be 'prefix_depth' as well which controlled how
many tokens were returned.

These would be global settings but they do have a parallel to the native
user permission regex matching which I think makes sense. Going inline with
the logic like you mentioned would be flexible but I'm not sure how helpful
it would be to have individual delimiters for different resource types.
Delimiters seem like they would be more of a global decision for the entire
broker once a proper group name convention was decided on.

This is not possible at the moment. Also it will make RabbitMQ violate the
assumption that the broker is not modifying messages at all.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Determining home node for queue
Message-ID: <1073b2a0-3aa2-49a4-88b3-7e0b8ff2e463@googlegroups.com>

Hi,

We currently run a two-node cluster with mirrored queues. We see a huge 
drop-off in throughput when our publishers or consumers connect to the 
non-home node for the queue. This was also confirmed outside of production 
with two fresh Vagrant VMs on both CentOS and Ubuntu, see 
gist https://gist.github.com/boffbowsh/6675281 and the Java Client 
MulticastMain example. Do others see this behaviour? We see this being 
easily mitigated by always connecting to the home node for the queue, and 
failing over if the home node goes down. However, we haven't yet been able 
to think of a nice clean way of ensuring clients always connect to this. We 
do have a dynamic LB at our disposal so we can create a sort of floating IP 
if that's easiest. 

Does anyone have any experience of this sort of setup in production, and 
can they provide any tips?

Many thanks,

Paul Bowsher

One of the cluster recovery configurations is "ignore":




  *   ignore - Your network really is reliable. All your nodes are in a rack, connected with a switch, and that switch is also the route to the outside world. You don't want to run any risk of any of your cluster shutting down if any other part of it fails (or you have a two node cluster).

Does this mode effectively turn off the heartbeat? Is a node detected as partitioned but nothing done?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] rabbitpy 0.5.0 released
Message-ID: <CAPnH5kqhxEGF3jwXPZCBuCsN-6DoCmJvYb4UhARjZb6fEfLhCg@mail.gmail.com>

rabbitpy 0.5.0, a minimalistic, thread-safe, pythonic RabbitMQ client
library is now available on pypi:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rabbitpy

Documentation is available at http://rabbitpy.readthedocs.org

*Highlights*

- Simple, blocking Pythonic API
- A thread-based connection and IO management system that properly supports
AMQP 0.9.1 server to client RPC semantics.
- Support for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3
- Support for the up-coming Connection.Blocked feature in RabbitMQ:
http://next.rabbitmq.com/connection-blocked.html

*Examples of Use*

A simple publisher for one-off message publishing:

    >>> rabbitpy.publish('amqp://guest:guest at localhost:5672/%2f',
                         exchange='test',
                         routing_key='example',
                         body='This is my test message',
                         properties={'content_type': 'text/plain'})

A simple consumer:

    >>> with rabbitpy.consume('amqp://guest:guest at localhost:5672/%2f',
'test') as c:
    ..    for message in c.next_message():
    ...         print message.properties['message_id']
    ...         print message.body
    ...         message.ack()
    ...
    856dfdc7-5ee3-4fc1-9635-977bf0043a9f
    {"foo": "bar"}

And a more complete consumer example:

    import rabbitpy
    with rabbitpy.Connection('amqp://guest:guest at localhost:5672/%2f') as
conn:
        with conn.channel() as channel:
            queue = rabbitpy.Queue(channel, 'example')
            with queue.consumer() as consumer:
                for message in consumer.next_message():
                    print('Message:')
                    print(' Time: %s' % message.properties['timestamp'])
                    print(' Body: %s' % message.body)
                    message.ack()


*Development Status*

This library is still considered experimental, but the API is set is not
expected to change. Barring any bug-fix releases, the next version (0.6.0)
will be move the library from alpha development status to beta. Testers are
needed!

Please report any bugs to https://github.com/gmr/rabbitpy/issues

Regards,

Gavin

AMQP heartbeats are a feature to enable client and server to detect connection failures in a timely fashion), whereas clustering operates over a completely different network transport and uses a different protocol. So there's no connection between these two things.

> One of the cluster recovery configurations is "ignore":
[snip]
> Does this mode effectively turn off the heartbeat?

No - as mentioned above, AMQP heartbeats and clustering are orthogonal.

> Is a node detected as partitioned but nothing done?

Yes, that's pretty much what this recover mode does. The idea behind 'ignore' is to avoid any further loss of service. The other recovery modes can lead to one or more of the remaining (unpartitioned) nodes restarting in order to heal the cluster (see 'autoheal' mode) or total loss of service on some nodes if they reside in a minority island (see 'pause_minority' mode). 

Cheers,
Tim

In theory you can but given that messages can be requeued and delivering and processing
them rarely takes a fixed amount of time, it will be pretty inaccurate.

Hi ,
I trying Clustring in two machine .

but after changing *.erlang.cookie* file of slave machine .
That slave machine node getting down
 after that if i am running any command on the slave machine - 
like -

rabbitmqctl stop_app
rabbitmqctl -n slave at host status

it always saying could not connect  node name node down 


but if i am running this command in slave machine -
rabbitmqctl -n master at host status

so its able to connect master machine .
but slave rabbitmq getting  down  

Please suggest solution on this .

Not so.

Commercial support is available from Pivotal for both vFabric RabbitMQ 
and open source RabbitMQ. The terms do differ between them.

The main differences are:

- vFabric RabbitMQ has a commercial license [0] whereas open source 
RabbitMQ is licensed under the MPL1.1 [1]
- vFabric RabbitMQ support can be purchased under a perpetual license 
whereas open source RabbitMQ is annual subscription only [2]
- the support window for a particular release of vFabric RabbitMQ is 
substantially longer (3yrs) than open source RabbitMQ (1yr) [3]
- the vFabric RabbitMQ release comes with a JMS client that is not 
available as part of the open source distribution [4]

That suggests that the .erlang.cookie files are not the same on both
nodes. Check that the cookie hash is identical as reported in the

Can you confirm that the slave is running when you experience these
failures? What does the slave logfile say?

Dear rabbitmq.com,

My name is Dessyre and I 'm Indonesian. I interested to use rabbitmq but i
have some problem for implementation. I want to use RPC for my 2 websites.
It's just to show the database from website as a server(website A) to
website  as a client (website B ). Maybe it will be help, if i use example.
Website A is a student data collection website from A university. Every
student can register themselves to this website just for name, id_student
and address. Website B is a goverment website that want to display data
from each university. if one student edit and update her/his data then the
data will be automatically be updated on the website A and B. And if come
website C as a client that want to have the same thing, i just make a
connection with the queue. Am I right???

Maybe it's so simple but I'm really new here. I confuse how to start. I
already finish make a dummy website by symfony framework. But I don't know
what the next. Please help me. Please, Thank you very much.

Hi,

Why do you keep only the last release in your repo? I'm not able to do
apt-get install for specific version.

Another question, when do you plan to  publish the next release ?

For boring technical reasons to do with our rather complicated release 
process. We hope to fix this at some point, but "at some point" might be 
quite a way off.

If it's any consolation you can download older debs from 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-server/

Hopefully a month or so. You can download nightly builds from:

(Previous message sent before finalisation -- please ignore it.)

Sorry to butt in, but I wanted to clarify a few things (about the Java client):

There is no ?rule? ?you shouldn?t share a channel between threads?.  It is (good) advice, though.

It is not true that ?basic.deliver will be called on the client library?s internal message loop thread?, handleDelivery is called on a Consumer callback thread.

It is fine to call ack from a Consumer.handleDelivery method, and it is OK to call any other channel method, but it is hard to program multi-thread control of a channel without getting into serious difficulties.

Some channel commands don't wait for a response, and some do.  If you are waiting for a response then your application thread is waiting (blocked). If you issue a second command that wants to wait for a response, the Java Client will block the second thread until the response has returned from the first.  This is thread-safe, and as designed.  However, there is no serialisation of these requests: if many simultaneously issue commands, they may execute in any order.  The state of the channel each command sees is therefore not predictable, and so the application threads need to cope with potential failures and reorderings.

Even commands that don't expect a response can interfere with another thread's commands by changing the state of the channel, so it is quite important that the application threads know what each other are doing.

Issuing acks from many threads runs the risk of a double ack (acking the same message twice), which is a protocol error.  Multi-acks suffer from the same problem.

I refer you to the following sections on the Java Client API documentation page (http://www.rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html):
> Channel thread-safety
> Channel instances are safe for use by multiple threads. Requests into aChannel are serialized, with only one thread being able to run a command on the Channel at a time. Even so, applications should prefer using a Channel per thread instead of sharing the same Channel across multiple threads.
> 
and, in the following section:
> Callbacks to Consumers are dispatched on a thread separate from the thread managed by the Connection. This means that Consumers can safely call blocking methods on the Connection or Channel, such asqueueDeclare, txCommit, basicCancel or basicPublish.
> 
> Each Channel has its own dispatch thread. For the most common use case of one Consumer per Channel, this means Consumers do not hold up other Consumers. If you have multiple Consumers per Channel be aware that a long-running Consumer may hold up dispatch of callbacks to other Consumers on that Channel.
> 
If you are interested?.  (background info):

It used to be the case that the consumer callbacks (e.g. handleDelivery) executed on the Connection thread. (This is no longer true?see below.) This meant it was quite dangerous to issue channel commands in a callback method:  the same thread that listened for frames from the server, might block waiting for a response from a channel command.  Deadlock.

The basic.ack command was alright, because there is no response waited for (and any other command which doesn?t have a protocol response is fine, too).  However, many applications tried to issue channel commands (like declareQueue or createChannel) which did expect responses, so they ran into trouble.

To obviate this problem, the QueueingConsumer was created: this essentially does all the necessary things in the callback to receive the message, puts it in a (communicating, thread-safe) Java queue, and returns.  The message can then be obtained from the Java queue by any other thread, including the original application thread.  If channel commands are subsequently issued they cannot block the Connection thread.

Issuing channel commands from more than one thread ran the risk of issuing a command requiring a response (a ?synchronous? command) while another thread was already waiting for a response.  This would be an error (a thread-safety error) because the client cannot cope with overlapping synchronous commands on the same channel.  This is prevented: a thread that issues a command expecting a response will block until any outstanding response is received on that channel.

Although the thread-safety issues are (should be?let?s not get complacent) now all fixed, this solution just made a deadlock on the Connection thread more likely if you were trying to code your own Consumer.

In RabbitMQ 2.7.0 and 2.7.1, the Java client was changed to take the callback executions off of the Connection thread altogether. This was for three reasons.  One was to allow channel commands to be issued in handleDelivery (et al.), which, by the way, meant that bespoke Consumers were easier to write?QueueingConsumer is now not (so) necessary.  The second was to recover more gracefully from Consumers that do silly things: throwing exceptions, hanging indefinitely, and so on.  And the third was to prevent Consumers on distinct channels from holding each other up.  (There is now a pool of threads used to execute Consumer callbacks, each channel?s callbacks being executed serially, but distinct channels? callbacks being allowed to run concurrently.)

It is quite safe to issue an ack (or nack) from another thread.  But you should beware of doing this twice, so multi-threaded applications need to be carefully designed to avoid ?confusion? over which thread does what??channel control fights?.

Channel commands can be issued from multiple threads if you can ensure that the correct channel protocol is observed.  To do this properly requires communication between the threads in the application, which can be non-trivial to get right (I recommend Java Concurrency in Practice, Addison Wesley, Goetz, et al.).

So, the ?advice? is not to share channels between application threads, but it is just advice.  It is expected that you might issue (n)acks from the Consumer handleDelivery method, and put other Channel method calls there, too.  No rules are being ?broken?.

Thanks Michael for your response , however I have another question , rabbit is best for propagation and routing and is not a database  , I am designing a social based system and I have my users in the database .
e.g Jack follows john , john follows jack
So when jack makes a post I write the post to my db and deliver the message to john by writing to johns exchange .John gets the message by waiting on a queue based on any message written to his exchange.is this the right approach to designing a social system with rabbitmq ?, thanks.

The main difference in starting in these two ways is that the server is 
run as root in the latter case, rather than the "rabbitmq" user. The 
failed startup also failed due to "undef" - i.e. the Erlang VM could not 
find the definition for a module.

I therefore wonder if the permissions of the server code have been 
changed somehow so that the "rabbitmq" user can't read it. If so, the 
easiest way to fix the permissions is probably to remove the deb and 
reinstall it.

Cheers, Simon

Thanks alvaro like I said this concept is totally new to me , however I would like to know if the consumers would run stand alone , that is apart from the web server ? , if that is the case does it mean I would have to keep my command line open always on my servers?

Sir/Madam,
                 This is for first time I am using RabbitMQ. After
searching, I come to know that first I have to install RabbitMq sever and
after doing that I used a code sample given in rabbitMq's official site.I
am pasting that code here also. I also tried to search the resolution of
this error but I am not able to get it's solution. This is a request to
please help me as soon as it can br possible.

Actually, the problem is that createConnection() method is throwing an
exception and the exception is "BrokerUnreachableException was Unhandled".

Please HELP ASAP.

Thanks.

Hello All,

I would like to federate all messages to the default unnamed queue - is
this possible?  I have tried variations of pattern matching nothing, but
believe I'll need to alter my publishing behaviour.  True or false?

Thanks in advance,

Greg

Sukhjeet,

Can you please be a bit more specific about

 * What the stack trace look like
 * How did you install RabbitMQ
 * If it is running
 * If there's anything in the log
 * What tutorial are you following and for what language

Then it will be much easier to provide specific advice.

MK

It's the default exchange that is "unnamed" (clients specify an empty string to refer to it).
Queue federation will be supposed in the next release (3.2). Are you talking about
exchanges?

>  I have tried variations of pattern matching nothing, but believe I'll need to alter my publishing behaviour.

It should be possible to federate any exchange, as far as I know. Can you post some specific
federation configuration examples and you code, and explain what your queues and bindings
setup is?

Hi,

If by "unnamed queue" you mean the default exchange with no name, then no,
you can't federate that exchange.

What do you mean by this? You can just run the PHP consumer directly on the
webserver process, although I wouldn't recommend doing that since you would
end up blocking all the server threads.

Is there a reason why you don't want to run the consumer from the command
line directly?

Alvaro

I think it was set to default value which is 600. I changed it to 30 seconds on upstream.
Now it detects the failure in around a minute and changes the link.

This behavior was observed when both links were up, but we just stopped and started the downstream broker. 
Bindings were not changed, there was only one queue listening to downstream stream with '#' routing key.
I will use tracer when I observe this next time.

No, not at the moment. Currently we just ask Mnesia whenever we need to 
know.

Well, you can invoke rabbit_mnesia:cluster_nodes(running) or 
rabbit_mnesia:cluster_nodes(all) or whatever.

No, that's the other way round - used to tell the node monitor that a 
node has joined.

What are you trying to do?

As Alvaro pointed out, it's any exchange other than the default exchange 
(since the "default exchange" really just means "publish to queue").

I'll update the documentation to make this clearer.

The clue's in the name. The broker was not reachable. Catch the 
exception to find out more, but I would bet that you haven't pointed the 
ConnectionFactory at the broker.

Hi Alvaro,

A plugin could subscribe to Mnesia system events that will report when
Mnesia stops and starts on nodes:
 http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/Mnesia_chap5.html#id76679

Depending on the kind of plugin you are writing you could use the
information sent to the log exchange (amq.rabbitmq.log) to determine
when nodes leave and join.

The consumer is publishing the response to the 'logs' exchange with a '' 
routing key, whereas...

...the producer is expecting replies on an exclusive, server-named queue.

Clearly that isn't going to work. And because the 'logs' exchange is 
also the exchange on which the consumer queue is bound you end up with 
the 'infinite loop' at the consumer since the response published by the 
consumer will be consumed by the consumer!

You need to change your consumer to publish the response to the default 
exchange ('') with the routing_key taken from props.reply_to of the request.

Matthias.

Yes. PHP environment is reset between requests, this does not work very

Hi there!

For example, I have 3 consumers on 1 queue.
If I set prefetch_count = 1, then server will use round-robin algorithm:
1st message to consumer1
2nd message to consumer2
3rd message to consumer3
4th message to consumer1 and so on.

But how does strategy changes when prefetch_count !=1? (for example 10)
Will server push 10 messages to consumer1, next 10 to 2 and so on?

And if prefetch_count = 1 but 1st consumer has already processed his
message? Will server send new message again to consumer1? Or in any cases
next message will be sent to consumer2?

It's round robin between consumers that haven't gone above the basic.qos
setting
for their channel. With prefetch > 1 it's just harder to see because you
have more
messages in flight.

Hi All,

Are channel best practices for connected RabbitMQ clients published
anywhere? I understand the threading limitations, that channels should not
be shared between threads. Does the channel concept exist only to support
multi-threaded applications, or does it have some other purpose?

If I marshal all calls to a channel onto a single thread in my application
code, is there any problem with simply maintaining a single channel for all
declares, publishes and consumes?

Additional questions:

1. Should each basic consume be invoked on a dedicated channel?

2. Do I need to basic.ack on the same channel on which I invoked
basic.consume?

Many thanks
Mike

Yes, rabbitmq_jsonrpc_channel is broken in 3.1.5 I'm afraid. It will be 
fixed in the next release.

It was added to avoid having N TCP connections from the same client in case
it needs to have multiple logical connections.

Should be fine.

If you want to have N consumers from the same OS process, it's not strictly
necessary.

You must ack/nack/reject on the same channel the delivery was on because
delivery_tag is
scoped per channel.

A good reason to use more than one channel is error handling, which in many
cases is per-channel.
For example, if you expect an exception for one operation that you can
recover from, you can use
a separate channel to make sure the connection closure caused by the
exception does not affect other operations in the same VM.

No, it's a bug. I'm sure it used to work the way you describe.

The channel concept exists (in AMQP) to provide a lightweight alternative to having one TCP connection per client, since the latter are resource intensive (to both client and server's detriment). Multiplexing multiple "clients" over a single TCP connection turns out to be a fairly common approach amongst network intensive applications. Channels also provide a unit of atomicity with regards message ordering, i.e., messages are always fully (FIFO) ordered from client to server over a single channel, whereas there are no ordering guarantees regarding messages concurrently sent (or delivered) over multiple channels.

One problem you might run into relates to the answer I've given below about correlating ACKs with the correct channel.

That's not strictly necessary, though neither is it wrong. Depending on your application logic, you might find that introduces unnecessary overhead (in terms of threads and associated synchronisation primitives used in the client and/or additional resource use on the server), so if I were you I would only do it if it is (a) necessary or (b) significantly simplifies your client code. Remember that a channel provides a FIFO ordering guarantee, so having multiple consumers on a single channel means that you're potentially dealing with messages from more than one source queue, in which case you might inadvertently introduce a serial bottleneck.

Yes, that is absolutely necessary. An ACK sent on another channel to the one on which the delivery was received will be treated as a channel error.

That doesn't exist at the moment, no.

Thanks Michael, Tim. great answers.

One more channel question:

You shouldn't share a channel between multiple threads, but given that an
ACK should be sent on the same channel that the delivery is received mean
that one _must_ violate this rule? I call basic.consume on my application
thread, but basic.deliver will be called on the client library's internal
message loop thread and then the ACK will no doubt be called on a separate
application thread (where I de-queue the message from my queuing consumer).
Is this violation of the do-not-use-channels-on-multiple-threads rule OK?

Thanks
Mike

If you run one consumer per thread, use a new channel for every one of them.

outputs.

# Fetch messages containing a line starting with a number
# The -g option to curl stops it from messing with [] and {}
# The %2b is the + character url encoded
$ curl -g "http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?grep=^[0-9]%2b"

I want to have a plugin that works with a concept of topics and partitioned
queues. What does this mean?

I want to create a topic called "my_topic" which implies having a
consistent hash exchange (CHE) called "my_topic" + one queue called
"node_name.my_topic" bound to the my_topic exchange. The queue message
contents should live in the "node_name" node.

Whenever a node joins the cluster, I want to automatically declare a queue
called "new_node.my_topic" and bind it to the "my_topic" CHE. That queue
will be declared on new_node, so the message contents would end up in that
node.

With this I want to achieve some sort of "partitioned queues".

I plan this plugin to be an extension to the management plugin, so one
would create one of these topics via an HTTP call.

Also when connecting to a broker, one could ask this plugin via HTTP to
send the proper queue name for a particular topic, in order to consume from
it.

Does this makes sense?

Thanks for the clarification Simon. This feature would be a huge benefit
for us. The way it stands now, if someone wants access isolation within a
vhost, we have to spin up a new vhost and then create shovels if they need
to intercommunicate.

I took a shot at modifying and compiling the ldap plugin and came up with a
seemingly working solution. I'm just getting my feet wet with Erlang but
does this have any glaring issues at first glance? I'm basically adding a
new derived value to the Args list so that when it's sent to fill()
${prefix} is properly expanded.

https://gist.github.com/jmcle/2b91d991c9a163ec9d37/revisions

My follow up question would be, what are the chances of getting something
similar to this added to the official code base?

Thanks,
James

Hi folks,

I was wondering why we don't support the connection_timeout amqp_params_network parameter in the amqp_uri:parse functions.

It seems to boil down to:

parse_amqp_param(Field, String) when Field =:= channel_max orelse
                                  Field =:= frame_max   orelse
                                  Field =:= heartbeat   ->
 try return(list_to_integer(String))
 catch error:badarg -> fail({not_an_integer, String})
 end;
parse_amqp_param(Field, String) ->
 fail({parameter_unconfigurable_in_query, Field, String}).


Would it be possible to add connection_timeout to the guard expression?

Thanks!

-Fred

What do you mean by "use rabbitmq in multiple users"? You could have 
your application connect to the RabbitMQ broker with a single user and 
enforce permissions itself; many applications do this.

Or you could use RabbitMQ access control: see 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html

Based on a quick look at the code, nothing is too wrong from a low level 
point of view. However, this is wrong:

case Predicate of
     true  -> Var = Something;
     false -> Var = SomethingElse
end,

since although Var happens to escape the inner scope in all cases, it's 
not very clear and modern Erlang compilers will complain. Instead you want:

Var = case Predicate of
           true  -> Something;
           false -> SomethingElse
       end,

> My follow up question would be, what are the chances of getting

However, I'd be reluctant to merge this; conceptually it's very specific 
to your use case - what if you want to match something other than up to 
the first '.'? What if you want to do that on something other than the 
resource name?

Really you want to be able to write something like ${name.prefix('.')}. 
That is (obviously) much more complicated though.

It's possible some half-way house could exist between these two 
extremes; if so I can't immediately think of it.

Cheers, Simon

Thanks for the feedback. You're right, the compiler didn't complain but
your way does makes more sense. I've updated the gist to reflect the
changes if anyone is following along.

As for use case specificity, I can see your point. Although, I'm struggling
to come up with a case where you would want to use a tokenized version of
anything other than name. Assuming name is the only thing that makes sense
you could potentially have a new attribute called 'prefix_delimiter' which
would be sent to the tokens function. If you wanted to add more
customization there could be 'prefix_depth' as well which controlled how
many tokens were returned.

These would be global settings but they do have a parallel to the native
user permission regex matching which I think makes sense. Going inline with
the logic like you mentioned would be flexible but I'm not sure how helpful
it would be to have individual delimiters for different resource types.
Delimiters seem like they would be more of a global decision for the entire
broker once a proper group name convention was decided on.

This is not possible at the moment. Also it will make RabbitMQ violate the
assumption that the broker is not modifying messages at all.

Hi,

We currently run a two-node cluster with mirrored queues. We see a huge 
drop-off in throughput when our publishers or consumers connect to the 
non-home node for the queue. This was also confirmed outside of production 
with two fresh Vagrant VMs on both CentOS and Ubuntu, see 
gist https://gist.github.com/boffbowsh/6675281 and the Java Client 
MulticastMain example. Do others see this behaviour? We see this being 
easily mitigated by always connecting to the home node for the queue, and 
failing over if the home node goes down. However, we haven't yet been able 
to think of a nice clean way of ensuring clients always connect to this. We 
do have a dynamic LB at our disposal so we can create a sort of floating IP 
if that's easiest. 

Does anyone have any experience of this sort of setup in production, and 
can they provide any tips?

Many thanks,

Paul Bowsher

One of the cluster recovery configurations is "ignore":




  *   ignore - Your network really is reliable. All your nodes are in a rack, connected with a switch, and that switch is also the route to the outside world. You don't want to run any risk of any of your cluster shutting down if any other part of it fails (or you have a two node cluster).

Does this mode effectively turn off the heartbeat? Is a node detected as partitioned but nothing done?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

rabbitpy 0.5.0, a minimalistic, thread-safe, pythonic RabbitMQ client
library is now available on pypi:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rabbitpy

Documentation is available at http://rabbitpy.readthedocs.org

*Highlights*

- Simple, blocking Pythonic API
- A thread-based connection and IO management system that properly supports
AMQP 0.9.1 server to client RPC semantics.
- Support for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3
- Support for the up-coming Connection.Blocked feature in RabbitMQ:
http://next.rabbitmq.com/connection-blocked.html

*Examples of Use*

A simple publisher for one-off message publishing:

    >>> rabbitpy.publish('amqp://guest:guest at localhost:5672/%2f',
                         exchange='test',
                         routing_key='example',
                         body='This is my test message',
                         properties={'content_type': 'text/plain'})

A simple consumer:

    >>> with rabbitpy.consume('amqp://guest:guest at localhost:5672/%2f',
'test') as c:
    ..    for message in c.next_message():
    ...         print message.properties['message_id']
    ...         print message.body
    ...         message.ack()
    ...
    856dfdc7-5ee3-4fc1-9635-977bf0043a9f
    {"foo": "bar"}

And a more complete consumer example:

    import rabbitpy
    with rabbitpy.Connection('amqp://guest:guest at localhost:5672/%2f') as
conn:
        with conn.channel() as channel:
            queue = rabbitpy.Queue(channel, 'example')
            with queue.consumer() as consumer:
                for message in consumer.next_message():
                    print('Message:')
                    print(' Time: %s' % message.properties['timestamp'])
                    print(' Body: %s' % message.body)
                    message.ack()


*Development Status*

This library is still considered experimental, but the API is set is not
expected to change. Barring any bug-fix releases, the next version (0.6.0)
will be move the library from alpha development status to beta. Testers are
needed!

Please report any bugs to https://github.com/gmr/rabbitpy/issues

Regards,

Gavin

AMQP heartbeats are a feature to enable client and server to detect connection failures in a timely fashion), whereas clustering operates over a completely different network transport and uses a different protocol. So there's no connection between these two things.

> One of the cluster recovery configurations is "ignore":
[snip]
> Does this mode effectively turn off the heartbeat?

No - as mentioned above, AMQP heartbeats and clustering are orthogonal.

> Is a node detected as partitioned but nothing done?

Yes, that's pretty much what this recover mode does. The idea behind 'ignore' is to avoid any further loss of service. The other recovery modes can lead to one or more of the remaining (unpartitioned) nodes restarting in order to heal the cluster (see 'autoheal' mode) or total loss of service on some nodes if they reside in a minority island (see 'pause_minority' mode). 

Cheers,
Tim

Publishing to an arbitrary node increases intra-cluster traffic so this is expected.

RabbitMQ HTTP API should provide relevant information:

In theory you can but given that messages can be requeued and delivering and processing
them rarely takes a fixed amount of time, it will be pretty inaccurate.

Hi ,
I trying Clustring in two machine .

but after changing *.erlang.cookie* file of slave machine .
That slave machine node getting down
 after that if i am running any command on the slave machine - 
like -

rabbitmqctl stop_app
rabbitmqctl -n slave at host status

it always saying could not connect  node name node down 


but if i am running this command in slave machine -
rabbitmqctl -n master at host status

so its able to connect master machine .
but slave rabbitmq getting  down  

Please suggest solution on this .

Not so.

Commercial support is available from Pivotal for both vFabric RabbitMQ 
and open source RabbitMQ. The terms do differ between them.

The main differences are:

- vFabric RabbitMQ has a commercial license [0] whereas open source 
RabbitMQ is licensed under the MPL1.1 [1]
- vFabric RabbitMQ support can be purchased under a perpetual license 
whereas open source RabbitMQ is annual subscription only [2]
- the support window for a particular release of vFabric RabbitMQ is 
substantially longer (3yrs) than open source RabbitMQ (1yr) [3]
- the vFabric RabbitMQ release comes with a JMS client that is not 
available as part of the open source distribution [4]

That suggests that the .erlang.cookie files are not the same on both
nodes. Check that the cookie hash is identical as reported in the
logfile when the broker starts up.

A superlative follow up - thanks for clearing up the details Steve, and for the history lesson (which I for one, found very enlightening)!

You should be able to recover the 'not found' bindings by a) recreating 
the queues (as you already have) and then b) stopping the entire cluster 
(i.e. no node must be left running) and restarting it.

> Regarding #2, if you need anything else from me, please let me know!

There is no smoking gun in the logs, so the likely source of the problem 
is some edge case error in the mirroring and/or recovery logic. That may 
take us a while to track down. I don't think there's any other info we 
need from your running cluster. Thanks for reporting this issue.

Matthias.

Matthias and Team,

Many, many thanks for your help in this matter.  We'll proceed with your
recommended approach.  We will also probably stop doing upgrades on running
clusters.  It seems it might be safer to do the full procedure (bringing
down the whole cluster for the upgrade).

If you happen to find the cause of this bug at some point, of course I
would be interested to know (especially if you fix it).

Thanks again,
Chris

At the moment that's not clear. There's very likely not to be anything 
upgrade-specific to this bug, minor version upgrades (i.e. 3.1.1 to 
3.1.5) don't really look any different to the cluster from stopping a 
node and then starting it again.

Sure, will do.

Many thanks Steve! A excellent summary. I've updated my blog post. Thanks
especially for clarifying how the threading around consumers works. I'm
using the .NET client. Is it a straight port of the Java client, or are
there significant differences?

Cheers
Mike

The AMQP URI spec page doesn't explain how to specify these parameters in the URI.
Should they be documented there?  The Java Client (as far as I know) doesn't look
for them when interpreting an URI.

Hmm. This is currently rather badly documented, it's split between the 
URI page and the shovel page (those query string params were originally 
shovel-specific).

I'll file a bug to get this made clearer...

Cheers, Simon

For those of you following along... We did as Matthias suggested, stopping
all the RabbitMQ nodes in the cluster, then restarted them.

After restarting, the bindings were there and working!  We did not need to
rebind.  So it seems that the bindings were really there all along, but
they were in some kind of weird latent state where they were not actually
active.  Bringing down the whole cluster and restarting it seems to have
resolved the issue.

In case it is of any importance, I will also mention that when we stopped
the cluster, nodes 2 and 5 did not stop gracefully-- they just hung.  So we
had to kill beam on those nodes.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi,

If you want that one event, like change of student information, is
broadcasted to many consumers, then use pub/sub and the fanout exchange as
explained here: http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-three-php.html

Just releasing what I've been working on :)  The perl based ones I had some
issues with, as they use for example the security realm from a way old
release of rabbit and hadn't been updated in a long while.  I'll be working
on this as time goes on adding more features and details.  Let me know if
anyone has any questions!  NOTE  by default I'm returning performance data.
 This is still a work in progress and open to help/ideas :)

There are significant differences. The .NET client thread model is
explained in section 2.9 and 2.10 of the user guide. (linked from
http://www.rabbitmq.com/clients.html). While the Java client allows
blocking AMQP methods to be invoked from consumer callbacks, the .NET
client does not. We plan to improve the .NET client to work more like
the Java client in this respect.

Hi,

It is not possible to say what the "right" approach is. An alternative
design is to create a common exchange and one queue for each user, with
bindings for all messages that a user is interested in. Messages will be
routed to the user's queue based on the bindings.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ crash report
Message-ID: <1380097272338-29893.post@n5.nabble.com>

With a two node RabbitMQ 3.1.5 cluster, Erlang R16B01:

Suddenly all vhost delete operations times out (or never finishes) via both
the http api and rabbitmqctl. Later queue delete operation stops, and
eventually creating new vhosts/users. 

Restarting just one node (and yeah, as usual the node can't be stopped
normally but have to be killed), and when bringing it back up again it
endlessly throws: 

Discarding message {'$gen_call',{<0.11812.0>,#Ref<0.0.0.180597>},stat} from
<0.11812.0> to <0.684.0> in an old incarnation (2) of this node (3)

A full cluster restart was required. But then "msg_store_persistent:
rebuilding indices from scratch" takes about ten minutes. 

Have a big log dump with a lot of juice error messages in if you want to
take a look. Some examples:

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Delayed stats
Message-ID: <1380097532433-29894.post@n5.nabble.com>

Often when polling stats msgs count and such is 0 or very low although i know
the machine is shuffling tons of messages. Instead the "correct" stats shows
up 10-60 seconds later, and you can see it in the charts on the mgmt
overview page that suddenly 10000msg/s pops up in the chart, when you've
seen anything like it in the "current" stats. 

Is there anything I can do to decrease the latency of the stats?

Presumably the management database process is getting overwhelmed and 
struggling to keep up. We already prioritise this process, and we can't 
really raise the priority further.

Things you could do:

* Switch off fine-grained statistics. If you don't need message rates 
that will cut the amount of work the management database is doing.

* Run the management plugin on a separate cluster node that isn't used 
for messaging.

Cheers, Simon

It does not sound unreasonable.

You can use RabbitMQ and something
like SockJS to propagate events to the clients. Or you can use it to distribute messages between
services that update the database.
The former largely depends on how your clients and UI work. The latter is whether you have
reasons to avoid updating the database directly (e.g. not all updates have to happen
immediately but lower client latency is desired).

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Binding key and routing key
Message-ID: <l1ugp3$2l3$1@ger.gmane.org>

I'm a bit confused about terms "binding key" and "routing key" in case 
of RabbitMQ. Until this moment, i thought that binding key is the mask 
that connets several RabbitMQ objects like queues and exchanges while 
routing key is the one of the message headers. Am i right? If so, why is 
C# API uses term "routing key" in methods QueueBind, ExchangeBind and 
ExchangeUnbind? I think that it must be "binding key". Java API also 
uses term "routing key" in case of queueBind. Why?

the term "binding key" is not used widely (I don't think 0-9-1 spec uses it, or any popular
clients do).

Your understanding of the two is correct but both are called routing key. A more appropriate term
for queue.bind and exchange.bind would probably be "routing pattern" but it would
not be very precise for e.g. fanout exchanges.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Clustering - just can't get it going
Message-ID: <CAMxG3ZOF_qEDd7BmZBV0dBjy7rDXjm7KY7haxf4ViUroiHMqTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've seen a number of people failing to get clustering running and,
unfortunately, I can't get it going either.  Here's the summary of what
I've got:

   - Two nodes - RMQ1 and RMQ2
   - I can ping RMQ1 from RMQ2, and vice versa
   - I can telnet from RMQ1 to RMQ2:epmd, and vice versa
   - I can telnet from RMQ1 to RMQ2:amqp, and vice versa
   - The cookie file is identical, as is clear from the startup INFO

My goal is to have RMQ2 join RMQ1 in a cluster.

The servers are started using the init script in Ubuntu (i.e. service
rabbitmq-server start).  This is different than the script at
http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html, which says to start with
"rabbitmq-server -detached".  I've tried that and it doesn't seem to make
any difference so I always use the init script instead.

So, the script says to stop the RMQ2 server and then join the cluster.  The
following transcript shows how well all this goes:

02:~$ sudo rabbitmqctl stop_app
Stopping node 'rabbit at RMQ2' ...
...done.

02:~$ sudo rabbitmqctl join_cluster --ram rabbit at RMQ1
Clustering node 'rabbit at RMQ2' with 'rabbit at RMQ1' ...
Error: {cannot_discover_cluster,"The nodes provided are either offline or
not running"}

However, as I said above, telnetting to the ports works just fine:

02:~$ telnet RMQ1 epmd
Trying <ip address>...
Connected to RMQ1
Escape character is '^]'.
booger!
Connection closed by foreign host.

02:~$ telnet RMQ1 amqp
Trying <ip address>...
Connected to RMQ1
Escape character is '^]'.
booger!
AMQP Connection closed by foreign host.

I'm stuck for what else to test.  Does anyone know how to troubleshoot this
thing further?

Thanks,
Derek

Check your erlang cookie on both servers to make sure it matches I think
it's in - /var/lib/rabbitmq/ - then you can use rabbitmqctl from one
machine and see if you can connect to another to list queues.  I THINK
that's rabbitmqctl -n <servernode> list_queues for example.  If both
servers can talk to each other then it should be rabbitmqctl stop_app,
join_cluster, start_app.

Thanks Jason.  The cookies are the same.  Running anything from rabbitmqctl
to the remote host fails, unfortunately.  The list_queues call fails to
connect, the same as join_cluster.

As I indicated, the telnets all work just fine, so I'm stuck for what to
diagnose next.  Any ideas would be great.

Ah, I do have more information though:

DIAGNOSTICS
===========

nodes in question: ['RMQ1']

hosts, their running nodes and ports:
- unable to connect to epmd on RMQ1: nxdomain (non-existing domain)

current node details:
- node name: 'rabbitmqctl1577 at RMQ2'
- home dir: /var/lib/rabbitmq
- cookie hash: ohQKEF09peb6bAgNqawvKA==

And just to be clear, the cookie is the same:

*01*:~$ sudo md5sum /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
a2140a105d3da5e6fa6c080da9ac2f28  /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
*02*:~$ sudo md5sum /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
a2140a105d3da5e6fa6c080da9ac2f28  /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie

Somehow, telnet to epmd works just fine, but something that RMQ is doing
fails to make that happen.  Is there some sort of DNS work that it's doing,
instead of using the hosts files?

i.e. one thing I found is that nslookup fails:

02:~$ nslookup RMQ1
;; Got SERVFAIL reply from <ipaddress>, trying next server
Server: <ipaddress>
Address: <ipaddress>

** server can't find RMQ1: SERVFAIL

But if I ping RMQ1 it works fine.  /etc/nsswitch.conf specifies that files
should be tried first, before DNS w.r.t. hosts.

So, it looks like RMQ is doing something more rigorous to resolve the host,
and I don't know how to change that.  I also don't have access to the DNS
server configuration in order to modify it in any way.

Hi,

In my case, I have a 2 node cluster (called cache1 and cache2) and I needed to add an entry to the hosts file on both nodes to ensure each node can resolve the name of the other node before clustering worked for me.

My hosts file is in /etc and is called hosts

In there I entered the following:

On cache1.lon.hosting, enter the line 192.168.3.1 Cache2.domain.com Cache2
On cache2.lon.hosting, enter the line 192.168.3.0 Cache1.domain.com Cache1

Once done, I needed to confirm I could ping each node using it's hostname from the other node. I don't care about DNS or nslookup working/resolving the name.

HTH

Hi,

I've seen a number of people failing to get clustering running and, unfortunately, I can't get it going either.  Here's the summary of what I've got:

  *   Two nodes - RMQ1 and RMQ2
  *   I can ping RMQ1 from RMQ2, and vice versa
  *   I can telnet from RMQ1 to RMQ2:epmd, and vice versa
  *   I can telnet from RMQ1 to RMQ2:amqp, and vice versa
  *   The cookie file is identical, as is clear from the startup INFO
My goal is to have RMQ2 join RMQ1 in a cluster.

The servers are started using the init script in Ubuntu (i.e. service rabbitmq-server start).  This is different than the script at http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html, which says to start with "rabbitmq-server -detached".  I've tried that and it doesn't seem to make any difference so I always use the init script instead.

So, the script says to stop the RMQ2 server and then join the cluster.  The following transcript shows how well all this goes:

02:~$ sudo rabbitmqctl stop_app
Stopping node 'rabbit at RMQ2' ...
...done.

02:~$ sudo rabbitmqctl join_cluster --ram rabbit at RMQ1
Clustering node 'rabbit at RMQ2' with 'rabbit at RMQ1' ...
Error: {cannot_discover_cluster,"The nodes provided are either offline or not running"}

However, as I said above, telnetting to the ports works just fine:

02:~$ telnet RMQ1 epmd
Trying <ip address>...
Connected to RMQ1
Escape character is '^]'.
booger!
Connection closed by foreign host.

02:~$ telnet RMQ1 amqp
Trying <ip address>...
Connected to RMQ1
Escape character is '^]'.
booger!
AMQP Connection closed by foreign host.

I'm stuck for what else to test.  Does anyone know how to troubleshoot this thing further?

Thanks,
Derek

The other issue I had in creating a cluster was that it wouldn't create if the web management plugin was running/installed on both nodes.

I needed to enter the following commands on each node:

rabbitmq-plugins disable rabbitmq_management
service rabbitmq-server restart

Hi,

In my case, I have a 2 node cluster (called cache1 and cache2) and I needed to add an entry to the hosts file on both nodes to ensure each node can resolve the name of the other node before clustering worked for me.

My hosts file is in /etc and is called hosts

In there I entered the following:

On cache1.lon.hosting, enter the line 192.168.3.1 Cache2.domain.com<http://Cache2.domain.com> Cache2
On cache2.lon.hosting, enter the line 192.168.3.0 Cache1.domain.com<http://Cache1.domain.com> Cache1

Once done, I needed to confirm I could ping each node using it's hostname from the other node. I don't care about DNS or nslookup working/resolving the name.

HTH

Ah, I do have more information though:

DIAGNOSTICS
===========

nodes in question: ['RMQ1']

hosts, their running nodes and ports:
- unable to connect to epmd on RMQ1: nxdomain (non-existing domain)

current node details:
- node name: 'rabbitmqctl1577 at RMQ2'
- home dir: /var/lib/rabbitmq
- cookie hash: ohQKEF09peb6bAgNqawvKA==

And just to be clear, the cookie is the same:

01:~$ sudo md5sum /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
a2140a105d3da5e6fa6c080da9ac2f28  /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
02:~$ sudo md5sum /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie
a2140a105d3da5e6fa6c080da9ac2f28  /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie

Somehow, telnet to epmd works just fine, but something that RMQ is doing fails to make that happen.  Is there some sort of DNS work that it's doing, instead of using the hosts files?

i.e. one thing I found is that nslookup fails:

02:~$ nslookup RMQ1
;; Got SERVFAIL reply from <ipaddress>, trying next server
Server:       <ipaddress>
Address:  <ipaddress>

** server can't find RMQ1: SERVFAIL

But if I ping RMQ1 it works fine.  /etc/nsswitch.conf specifies that files should be tried first, before DNS w.r.t. hosts.

So, it looks like RMQ is doing something more rigorous to resolve the host, and I don't know how to change that.  I also don't have access to the DNS server configuration in order to modify it in any way.

Hi,

I've seen a number of people failing to get clustering running and, unfortunately, I can't get it going either.  Here's the summary of what I've got:

  *   Two nodes - RMQ1 and RMQ2
  *   I can ping RMQ1 from RMQ2, and vice versa
  *   I can telnet from RMQ1 to RMQ2:epmd, and vice versa
  *   I can telnet from RMQ1 to RMQ2:amqp, and vice versa
  *   The cookie file is identical, as is clear from the startup INFO
My goal is to have RMQ2 join RMQ1 in a cluster.

The servers are started using the init script in Ubuntu (i.e. service rabbitmq-server start).  This is different than the script at http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html, which says to start with "rabbitmq-server -detached".  I've tried that and it doesn't seem to make any difference so I always use the init script instead.

So, the script says to stop the RMQ2 server and then join the cluster.  The following transcript shows how well all this goes:

02:~$ sudo rabbitmqctl stop_app
Stopping node 'rabbit at RMQ2' ...
...done.

02:~$ sudo rabbitmqctl join_cluster --ram rabbit at RMQ1
Clustering node 'rabbit at RMQ2' with 'rabbit at RMQ1' ...
Error: {cannot_discover_cluster,"The nodes provided are either offline or not running"}

However, as I said above, telnetting to the ports works just fine:

02:~$ telnet RMQ1 epmd
Trying <ip address>...
Connected to RMQ1
Escape character is '^]'.
booger!
Connection closed by foreign host.

02:~$ telnet RMQ1 amqp
Trying <ip address>...
Connected to RMQ1
Escape character is '^]'.
booger!
AMQP Connection closed by foreign host.

I'm stuck for what else to test.  Does anyone know how to troubleshoot this thing further?

Thanks,
Derek

That was something new to try - thanks - but didn't help :)

I'm looking into this nxdomain (non-existing domain) issue - it's gotta
have something to do with that.  Seems odd though... the hosts file is just
fine.

You may (depending on Erlang version) need to make sure that each 
machine can resolve its own hostname too, as well as the other one.

Uh, really?

If you try to create a cluster on a single machine then you need to 
configure management to open a different port for each node. But 
clusters where every node runs management are definitely supported (and 
indeed rather common). What error message did you see?

Cheers, Simon

Yep, really. I can't recall the error message though but after creating the cluster the web management plugin was enabled again.

This is rabbitmq 3.1.5 - I'm not sure what the erlang version is, but the
erts version is 5.8.5.  I'm a little new to the whole erlang thing, so I
just picked a component with 'e' in it :P

I'm planning to get these machines into the DNS proper to see if that
helps.  It would be pretty weird if it works, since everyone else works OK
with just /etc/hosts resolution, but it's worth a try.

SOLVED.

After getting these things in the DNS and ensuring that /etc/resolv.conf
was correct (the dynamic configuration puts them in the wrong domain),
things are working.  checking the cluster_status on both machines has
things listed properly.

Thanks for the help.

Regs,
Derek

I have few questions on MultiCastMain.java...

1) Could you tell me how is the -c option behaving and what appropriate
integer value should we use in it.
2) What is nacked rate? It comes always 0 msg/s irrespective of what options
we use.
3) What is returned rate?
4) Whenever we use the option -f immediate it throws an exception "Exception
in thread "Thread-1" com.rabbitmq.client.AlreadyClosedException: clean
connection shutdown; reason: Attempt to use closed channel
"

Hello Derek

Three things I might recommend given my experience having issues similar 
to yours.

1) Do be sure that every package that you have, depending on your Linux 
distribution (or depending on the OS version), is updated to the latest 
version.
In my case, I apparently had permission problems with Erlang and a 
segmentation fault. I added the Debian repository
along with the Squeeze repositories, used the latest version and it 
worked. This only applies to Debian Squeeze (6) and RabbitMQ V 3.1.5

2) Be sure that you don't have the hosts ports restricted by any 
Firewalling or Wrappers software. Be sure you have no entries
on /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny and that your endpoint (network 
router/switch) doesn't have any port or network restrictions.

3) Test the connectivity and the ports. You can try doing "telnet 
hostname port" to see if you can see the ports from one host to the
other. I would particularly recommend testing this with the Rabbit and 
to simply disconnect.

Let's hope this helps

Regards,
Allan Baker

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ - strange synchronization behavior
Message-ID: <CAOne3=kTrJ_Y8aV1K+U4n7pB4aFrCVDqOqBnwa2_M1MSRfkm+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have a small RabbitMQ cluster with two nodes(CentOS, RabbitMQ 3.1.5,
Erlang R15B, 2GB ram). Mirroring and synchronization is on.

When I restart one of the nodes(by "stop_app" and "start_app" from the
commandline)  the whole cluster is blocked. It doesn't accept any
publish and receive operations during synchronization stage. When
synchronization is finished everything get back to normal - cluster
accepts publish and receive operations.
Is this behavior normal?

Actually, if you type "binding key" into the search field on the RabbitMQ site, 
you discover that the term is used (in the sense Nikita espouses) in two tutorials,
in the Exchange to Exchange bindings blog entry, and in the discussion on Alternate
Exchanges.

The STOMP adapter page refers to a binding 'pattern', but I didn't find any other
references.

There are phrases like "the binding's routing key" in the rabbitmqctl manual page,
and (interestingly) the Introduction to the AMQP 1.0 Draft (presentation pdf) uses
the term unconsciously on a Topic Exchange diagram.

I think that the term binding key, used consistently, would improve the description
and understanding of bindings no end.  This point seems to have been embraced by
the tutorials quite successfully.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] msg_store_transient usage question
Message-ID: <CAHYBi3DbV3bkqjF60mJW51xpWkEK4o9jHUxKd6j8dJGJge8Leg@mail.gmail.com>

hello,
i was hoping someone could help explain to me under what circumstances
messages are written to the msg_store_transient directory.  i have been
witnessing this directory grow to 10's of GB - infact it spun out of
control at one point consuming almost 100G of space.  i do have a queue
with quite a few messages ready for consumption, yet when i monitor memory
utilization for this queue it rarely spikes above 20MB.

my understading from reading the documentation is that transient messages
are only written to disk when memory has been exhausted or put under
pressure, yet beam.smp is only consuming a fraction of available resident
memory.

our configuration for reference is:
erlang = R16B
rabbitMQ = 2.8.7
os = centos-5.8-x64

thanks in advance!
-pete

	usage
Message-ID: <DD7729D61B083D48A2CDCB66A27AD4C98C89DC@BSDMSATMBX001.mahindrasatyam.ad>

Hi Alan,

Thanks for the earlier prompt replies. I am trying amqp_simple_wait_frame_noblock API in amqp_listen.c example from rabbitmq-c library. I have successfully opened new connection and channel and created queue for this listner. I want the frame to wait for 10 seconds to receive the message sent by sender. I declared the timeout as follows.

struct timeval timeout;
timeout.tv_sec = 10;
timeout.tv_usec = 0;

result = amqp_simple_wait_frame_noblock(conn, &frame, &timeout);

However I noticed that this API is not waiting for 10seconds and I am getting timeout in around 1-2seconds. Could you please provide a snippet for the usage of this API as I was not able to get it from the current examples?

Thanks and regards,
Shashank

Hi Alan,

Currently I am trying SSL APIs from Rabbitmq-C master. I am able to open SSL connection with broker. Most of the time when I publish I don't get any error but sometimes I get AMQP_STATUS_SSL_ERROR. What is the reason for this error? My keys and certificates remains is unchanged during the testing. Also there is no connection loss to the broker otherwise I would have received AMQP_STATUS_SOCKET_ERROR.

Please help.
Thanks and regards,

Yes.

"If a queue is set to automatically synchronise it will synchronise 
whenever a new slave joins - becoming unresponsive until it has done so."
    -- http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html#unsynchronised-slaves

While any given queue is (explicitly) syncing it will not do anything 
else; publishes to it will block. Therefore it's a reasonable idea to 
only explicitly sync queues that are not busy, if a queue is being 
actively published to and consumed from then it will become synchronised 
after a while anyway, explicit syncing is not needed. We envisaged 
explicit syncing being used more for queues that are not very active.

And yes, it would be nice if explicit syncing could happen in the 
background while other things happened. Let's just say that it would be 
complicated to do that...

Cheers, Simon

The memory use reported by the queue does not include message bodies 
(since these are shared across queues). Also it does not include 
anything that's been paged out, so if messages are paging out it can be 
quite low anyway.

The decision as to whether to page messages is made globally based on 
how much memory is in use. All released versions of RabbitMQ (since 
2.0.0 when the persister was rewritten) will start to page out when 20% 
of the way to the high watermark. By default the high watermark is at 
40% of physical memory, so paging will start at 8% memory used.

That's probably too cautious, so the next release (3.2.x) will raise the 
paging ratio from 20% to 50% (so paging will start at 20% memory used by 
default) and also make it configurable. See 
http://next.rabbitmq.com/memory.html#memsup-paging

Having said that, if msg_store_transient grows to 100GB of space, I 
suspect you probably have 100GB of messages. If you don't have 100GB of 
RAM, you're going to page out...

Hope this helps.

Cheers, Simon

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] memory leak rabbitmq 3.1.5
Message-ID: <7c569223-7049-4993-8690-9333de7056b4@googlegroups.com>

Hi!


I 'm running 3.1.5 rabbitmq cluster composed by 2 virtual servers. Centos 
6.3/6.4 kvm virtual machines.

( actually I have 6 clusters composed by 2 virtuals each )

When running 3.0.4 version cluster performance was so good. 

But I upgrade to 3.1.5 and start to notice a strange behaviour. 

Although the cluster was not used, no queues were created, memory used by 
"beam.smp " start growing gradually.

All seems like a memory leak.

I check the report command and all the memory was used by plugins.


 [{total,756328224},
      {connection_procs,1207264},
      {queue_procs,2457672},
      {plugins,696907152},
      {other_proc,3627680},
      {mnesia,1369320},
      {mgmt_db,3730856},
      {msg_index,167952},
      {other_ets,1476848},
      {binary,4091872},
      {code,17899383},
      {atom,1803449},
      {other_system,21588776}]},



These are the plugins I am using.


[root@ ~]# rabbitmq-plugins list                  
[e] amqp_client                       3.1.5

[e] webmachine                        1.10.3-rmq3.1.5-gite9359c7
[root@ ~]# 



I start disabling one by one the plugins and I come across with the most 
feasible candidate. Stomp.


I disable stomp plugin and memory settle.




Any of you experienced same behaviour?


Any feedback will be really appreciated.

Thanks!

It turns on confirms, and then will only allow (number specified)

Nacks are very rare, you would only tend to receive them if a queue

Yes, immediate support was removed from RabbitMQ server 3.0.0, see

Hmm. Odd. I'm certainly not aware of a memory leak in STOMP.

Are you sure nothing is opening STOMP connections to your broker? 
Connections will only appear in mgmt when a CONNECT frame has been sent, 
so if something is just opening TCP sockets then they will not show up.

What does
$ rabbitmqctl eval 
'length(supervisor:which_children(rabbit_stomp_client_sup_sup)).'

say when the system is in this state?

Yes, but the spec names the field 'routing-key' in 
{queue,exchange}.[un]bind. We cannot change that.

AMQP and MQTT are both supported by RabbitMQ, but they are different
protocols. If you explain your goal then we can guide you in the right
direction.

I already got this link by exploring. But there is Condition to run code
under this tutorial; first of all i ave to install amqplib thats why i
asked you...


Requirements
Apart from npm and node, to run this code you need
node-amqp<https://github.com/postwait/node-amqp>
 version 0.1.X. To pull the dependency from npm run:

I'd highly recommend taking a look at https://github.com/squaremo/amqp.node,
too. It has the tutorials ported as well, see the README.

To install either client you need to have Node installed (recent versions bundle NPM).

To learn how to do that, see http://nodejs.org.

After that, you can install one of the clients using npm, e.g. see the first line
in the README of amqp.node:

https://github.com/squaremo/amqp.node/

Yes, there are prerequisites that need to be installed first. Node.js is
the only JavaScript library with a translation of the tutorials
available at this time.

If you translate the tutorials for another library then please consider
contributing it. Also see the information on web messaging from the
RabbitMQ website:

Please keep rabbitmq-discuss on CC.

I have just synced 2M x 512 byte messages in 50 seconds on my 
workstation with paging disabled. So the sync mechanism itself is not 
necessarily slow.

But that's with a) a fast network b) all messages in RAM on both nodes. 
Once the queue is big enough that it's paged out, synchronisation slows 
right down. On a slower machine (2010 MBP), the same test took 9 min 36 
sec with much paging.

Obviously paging will slow things down, although it does look like the 
slowdown is disproportionate (it took 3min to load the messages in the 
first place, which also required paging). So there might be room for 
improvement there.

But 7 hours is way too much! Are you sure the messages were 512 bytes? 
Were there any unacknowledged messages? Is your disk particularly slow?

Cheers, Simon

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Long pauses when closing many channels
	simultaneously
Message-ID: <8a7a1859-5ff0-49a3-8ba9-edef63830591@googlegroups.com>



I have 1 RabbitMQ Connection, 10K publishing Channels, 10K consuming 
Channels and 100 Threads. All channels are in rapid publish/consume "loops" 
using exclusive queues and external synchronization; no possibility of 
publish, consume or close happening simultaneously on a channel. Closing 
channels simultaneously on 100 threads incurs a delay of 2.5 seconds for 
each of the first 100 channels. All subsequent closures are processed in 
less than 0.5 seconds. If I bump it up to 20K+20K channels the initial 100 
each take 5 seconds to close. With 30K+30K each takes 10 seconds, where 
we're pretty much at the channel-max for a connection. Similarly if I 
reduce the number of threads to 50 then it's the first 50 channels that 
close slowly.

Let me restate that... *With 30K+30K channels the first 100 each take 10 
seconds to close using 100 simultaneous threads. The remaining 59,900 each 
take less than 0.5 seconds.* My feeling is that there's some funky 
connection-wide synchronization/continuation going on here. Hit the 
connection up with 100 channel-close requests on 100 threads simultaneously 
and it baulks. Whatever causes that initial spasm doesn't seem to affect 
subsequent close operations and everything swims along nicely.

I've tried ramping up the number of connections to relieve the pressure. 
This certainly works with predictable results. With 30K+30K connections 
spread evenly over 2 connections the initial 100 channel-close delays are 
halved from 10 seconds to 5 seconds. Use 10 connections and the delay is 
imperceptible when compared to the subsequent 59,900 channel closures. Jump 
to 50K+50K channels (we can do this with 10 connections but not 1 
connection due to channel-max) and the delays start to creep back in again.

My concerns with this approach are that 1) multiple connections are 
discouraged in the documentation due to i/o resource overhead and that 2) 
it's not clear for my application how to sensibly predict the optimum 
number of channels per connection. If there is a soft limit to the number 
of channels per connection why is it not documented or made available in 
the api? If I have to manage a number of connections and allocate channels 
across those connections in a robust manner I feel like I'm doing the work 
of a client library!

I've tried my hand at modifying the client library by not waiting for 
channel-close acknowledgements from the RabbitMQ server. This worked like a 
charm. Channels were closed instantly with no delay in the client and 
confirmed as closed on the server. Eight hours later though and I was out 
of heap space as the channel resources internal to the client library were 
not being released. I haven't managed to isolate the source of the delay 
either... is it in the client library or the server itself? To progress 
further I'd need to trace the wire protocol. I think I'm off track with 
this approach!

*Questions:*

Before making application changes I'd like to know if this is a known issue 
with the Java client? Are there better workarounds than multiple 
connections and application-level channel management? In practise my actual 
application uses around 20K channels per process, which I don't feel is 
excessive, and message throughput is actually pretty light as I'm 
leveraging RabbitMQ more for it's routing capabilities. if you think the 
number of channels is a problem in itself then please say so! I could 
refactor to use less channels but then I'd be sharing channels and would 
either have to synchronize their usage or ignore documentation guidelines. 
The error handling paradigm makes this cumbersome though; any channel error 
results in it's termination so it's difficult to isolate errors, prevent 
them from permeating across unrelated publishers/consumers and recover in a 
robust manner.

*Detail:*

RabbitMQ server 3.1.5, Java amqp-client 3.1.5. Also tried 3.1.4, 3.1.3 in 
the same test harness and seen what I assume to be exactly the same 
behaviour in 3.0 and prior in production application.

My test harness is standalone but a bit obtuse to post here. I create 10K 
test clients each of which creates an exclusive queue and runs a continuous 
publish-consume-publish-consume loop. The publisher and consumer each have 
their own channels. I'm using channel.basicConsume with DefaultConsumers 
and a default consumer executor service. Also used my own Java executor 
service, which appears to be the same as the default implementation, with 
various numbers of threads to no discernible effect.

Messages consumed in handleDelivery spawn a new publish task via a 
java.concurrent fixed thread pool, so the consumer thread is not tied up or 
used in any channel operations whatsoever. The channel-close is 
synchronized so that it cannot happen at the same time as a publish. 
However there's nothing stopping a consume happening while close is being 
processed - the consumer is out of my control.

Thanks for any pointers!

The channel shutdownCompleted just refers to that particular channel. You 
could have many other channels running quite happily and you don't need to 
do anything. The other channels and any connection you're using are just 
fine, as is the server. Do be careful not to use that channel again though 
as it will just raise more errors.

I don't see you logging much about the error in your code sample. In 
shutdownCompleted if you e.printStackTrace() the error message can be quite 
detailed.

There is a default heartbeat negotiated between the client and the server. 
I think this is since version 3.0 but may be wrong. I guess it's value 
depends on the setup. For our Java/OSX/RHEL setup over a Gb LAN it seems to 
default to 30 minutes. We're using a load balancer in the middle though and 
this times out TCP connections after 1 minute of inactivity. We simply set 
the heartbeat to 30 seconds on the ConnectionFactory and everything stays 
alive indefinitely. Certainly many days even if there is no application 
activity.

Please keep rabbitmq-discuss on CC.

So that shows 30 STOMP connection processes. Is that what you would 
expect? Does that correspond with what you see in the management 
connection listing? What about "lsof -i :61613"?

Cheers, Simon

Yes, it can. You should call basic_consume method for 2 queues with necessary routing keys and callback-function (different or the same) at first and then start consuming so you will receive messages from both 2 queues.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] How to check is some bind present or no?
Message-ID: <1380199751449-29943.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi there!
I look at all amqp methods and don't find any one that can give me
information about is some binding present or not.

For example, I want make binding only if it isn't present (I want delete all
bindings that I created when my program stopped, but I don't want delete
bind if they were present before).

Is it any method to do it?

I expect 0 stomp connetions. The unique one connection on 61613 should be
the cluster one.

Port 61613 is not used for clustering, it's just stomp.

Ah.

So you have one connection, from some ruby script. But 3802 connection 
processes. So something is somehow leaking. Thank you for reporting this 
bug.

But to help get to the bottom of it - what is that ruby script doing?

Cheers, Simon

It was the connetion to the mcollective rabbitmq middleware. ( we 've got
all the machines connected to mcollective )

I removed the mcollective conection. Disabling it. And restarting the
rabbitmq-server.

That's we got now


[root at rabbit03.bcn rabbitmq]# lsof -i :61613
COMMAND    PID     USER   FD   TYPE  DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
beam.smp 17472 rabbitmq   21u  IPv6 4652854      0t0  TCP *:61613 (LISTEN)
[root at rabbit03.bcn rabbitmq]#  rabbitmqctl eval
'length(supervisor:which_children(rabbit_stomp_client_sup_sup)).'
50
...done.
[root at rabbit03.bcn rabbitmq]#

And the process growing...

My feeling is that there's some funky connection-wide synchronization/continuation going on here. Hit the connection up with 100 channel-close requests on 100 threads simultaneously and it baulks. Whatever causes that initial spasm doesn't seem to affect subsequent close operations and everything swims along nicely.

This is correct. Closing either a channel or connection involves waiting for a reply from RabbitMQ. 
Iit would be interested to see thread dumps and as much information about lock contention you can provide. My guess is that it is _channelMap but I'm not a very reliable prediction machine.

With 30K+30K connections spread evenly over 2 connections the initial 100 channel-close delays are halved from 10 seconds to 5 seconds. Use 10 connections and the delay is imperceptible when compared to the subsequent 59,900 channel closures. Jump to 50K+50K channels (we can do this with 10 connections but not 1 connection due to channel-max) and the delays start to creep back in again.

Again, hard to tell what the contention point is without runtime data.

If there is a soft limit to the number of channels per connection why is it not documented or made available in the api?

See ConnectionFactory.DEFAULT_CHANNEL_MAX and ConnectionFactory#setRequestedChannelMax.

Note that some clients have a different default (like 65536 channels).

Channels were closed instantly with no delay in the client and confirmed as closed on the server. Eight hours later though and I was out of heap space as the channel resources internal to the client library were not being released. I haven't managed to isolate the source of the delay either... is it in the client library or the server itself?

You need to make sure that ChannelManager#disconnectChannel is used. VisualVM should
pretty quickly show what objects use most heap space.

I've seen this before with 2 other clients. In one case the problem was different and mostly solved
(I have not tried 60K channels but for 6-8K it worked reasonably well). Another client is built on the
Java one. So, it's a known problem that few people run into.

> Are there better workarounds than multiple connections and application-level channel management? In practise my actual application uses around 20K channels per process, which I don't feel is excessive, and message throughput is actually pretty light as I'm leveraging RabbitMQ more for it's routing capabilities. if you think the number of channels is a problem in itself then please say so! I could refactor to use less channels but then I'd be sharing channels and would either have to synchronize their usage or ignore documentation guidelines.

This is something that should be improved in the Java client, but in the meantime you may need
to use a pool of connections that will open channels using round robin or similar.

> The error handling paradigm makes this cumbersome though; any channel error results in it's termination so it's difficult to isolate errors, prevent them from permeating across unrelated publishers/consumers and recover in a robust manner.

This is in part why having one channel per thread is a very good idea.

To summarize: yes, this is a known but rare problem. If you can provide profiling and thread dump
information that will help isolating the contention point, I think the issue can be resolved or largely
mitigated in a future version.

HTTP API can list bindings.

So, just to be clear, you want to write a program that does the following:

1) for all bindings that need to be created, check whether the binding 
already exists

2) if the binding does not exist then create it and remember that

3) when the program finishes, delete all the bindings that were created 
in step (2)

The above would be fantastically racy. What if some other program added 
or deleted a binding between step 1 and 2?

An alternative, non-racy approach would be to make the bindings unique 
to the program by adding some a program invocation specific GUID to the 
binding arguments.

Matthias.

 Matthias, yes you has understood my use case correct!

And thanks a lot for your comment, I didn't think about race problems.
Use bind arguments, i think, is a good idea

Hmm. Something must be establishing short-lived stomp connections 
though, do you see lines like:

   =INFO REPORT==== 26-Sep-2013::15:06:39 ===
   accepting STOMP connection <0.376.0> ([::1]:56780 -> [::1]:61613)

in the log?

Cheers, Simon

ok, I got keepalived above the cluster. And is balancing 61613 and 5672
could be keepalived opening and not closing something properly?
I undertstand the connections are being close well, but ..

Ah, thank you. Sounds like the cause. I'll file a bug; in the mean time 
I suggest you only use 5672 for keepalived.

In tag 3.1.5 I can point to the close(...) method in ChannelN.java at line
569:

            // Now that we're in quiescing state, channel.close was sent and
            // we wait for the reply. We ignore the result.
            // (It's NOT always close-ok.)
            notify = true;
            k.getReply(-1);

Here k.getReply(-1) does the waiting. In my dodgy mod I skipped these two
lines and also the finally block (notify==false):

        } finally {
            if (abort || notify) {
                // Now we know everything's been cleaned up and there should
                // be no more surprises arriving on the wire. Release the
                // channel number, and dissociate this ChannelN instance
from
                // our connection so that any further frames inbound on this
                // channel can be caught as the errors they are.
                releaseChannel();
                notifyListeners();
            }
        }

Hence the channel resource leak and subsequent OOM. Although the delay
disappeared and the channels were closed on the server it doesn't reveal
where the delay was incurred. The client may have just been waiting for
replies to come in after other data on the connection, with no lock
contention, but on the other hand how do the subsequent closures get
processed so much quicker?

In my 3.1.5 client ConnectionFactory.DEFAULT_CHANNEL_MAX==0 and
connection.getChannelMax()==65,536.

As revealed by YourKit mountains of Channels were not cleared up by my
dodgy mod skipping disconnectChannel(). But I figured it was unsafe to
invoke as it we don't know "everything's been cleaned up and there should
be no more surprises arriving on the wire."

A few seconds here and there is not so problematic really. RabbitMQ is so
critical to our application though that we need to ensure we're not falling
off any edges.

Thanks. Will do. Would you prefer a plain old Java app that you can profile

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Mirrored Queue Failover takes longer than
	expected
Message-ID: <f7d45644-bc0f-4726-beb6-a92246815e33@googlegroups.com>

Hi,

I am currently testing out some RabbitMQ cluster configurations and have 
come across some behaviour that is undesirable in an otherwise useful set 
up.
The amount of time the cluster takes to promote a mirrored slave queue to 
become the master seems quite long.

I have a cluster with two instances of RabbitMQ sat behind a load balancer 
in order to handle reconnection when one of the boxes fails. 
I have a publisher publishing persistent messages to a durable mirrored 
queue.
If one box dies, the publisher will attempt to reconnect via the load 
balancer. The load balancer, knowing one box is down, directs the traffic 
to the healthy RabbitMQ instance.
This reconnection is very fast, however, when attempting to publish to the 
healthy RabbitMQ exceptions are thrown for a period of between 40-80 
seconds before messages are published as normal again.

Has anyone else experienced similar behaviour when using RabbitMQ 
clustering in this way? Ideally, the failover time for my implementation 
needs to be negligible. 

Having implemented this using both the .NET and Java SDKs I believe I have 
ruled out the implementation of the SDKs being the cause.
I have also run tests that do not use the load balancer to be sure it isn't 
the cause of the issue so my current understanding is that this must be a 
limitation of RabbitMQ.

If anyone has any knowledge they can share on this topic I would greatly 
appreciate it.

Cheers

You should probably read http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html#flow-control 
and http://www.rabbitmq.com/nettick.html.

In short, we have to treat the slave as slow (meaning we wait for it) 
until we have decided it is definitely down. You can configure how long 
that takes.

Cheers, Simon

fantastic this really clarifies things on my end!  your explanation 
lines up pretty much with what we are seeing on our end.

Hi Simon,

That pages says this:

It is possible to set vm_memory_high_watermark_paging_ratio to a greater
value than 1.0. In this case queues will not page their contents to disc.

What would happen then? Will RabbitMQ stop receiving messages? Drop
messages?

Cheers,

Alvaro

Nothing changes, apart from the queues don't page out. So memory fills 
up with messages, the memory alarm goes off and publishers are blocked.

This is a somewhat general error that occurs when OpenSSL returns an error
to rabbitmq-c when trying to read or write from the socket. It usually
means that OpenSSL has an encountered and error on the SSL/TLS channel that
cannot be recovered and thus the SSL/TLS channel must be closed. You can
get more information about the error by probing the OpenSSL error stack.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Can one consumer listen to 2 queues
Message-ID: <b786ee10-cade-4ccd-b0b8-17aea25994a4@googlegroups.com>



I configured producer to a fanout exchange and a queue, and same with 
consumer. For some reason special messages are not broadcasted, while each 
receiver randomly receives normal messages one at a time. Can someone help 
me the loophole in my approach. Am I doing something not supposed to ?

// My producerString fanExName = "myFanEx";String qName = "myQ";
// setup
channel.queueDeclare(qName, false, false, false, null);
channel.exchangeDeclare(fanExName, "fanout");
// usageif (isSpecialMessage(msg)) {
  channel.basicPublish(fanExName, "", null, message.getBytes());} else {
  channel.basicPublish("", qName, null, message.getBytes());}
---
// My consumerString fanExName = "myFanEx";String qName = "myQ";
// setup
channel.queueDeclare(qName, false, false, false, null);
channel.exchangeDeclare(fanExName, "fanout");QueueingConsumer consumer = new QueueingConsumer(channel);
channel.basicConsume(qName, true, consumer);
channel.queueBind(qName, fanExName, "");
// usagewhile (true) {
    QueueingConsumer.Delivery delivery = consumer.nextDelivery();
    ...}

Is there a better way of doing this. I dont want all messages to reach all 
recievers irrespective of type of message.

*Update*: I tried a different approach by using one fanout exchange + 2 
queues in worker In worker, I bound a standard queue "spl-q" and a 
generated (random) queue to bind to the same fanout exchange. I did 
channel.basicConsume(queue_name, true, consumer), for both queues

This also did not work

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Consumer slows down (a lot) after producer
 exceeds a certain publish rate, why?
Message-ID: <CABMzP9N79aMX3o0BsoYWApkWY1KBqAtPmaqozj05fD3BZfiecw@mail.gmail.com>

3.15 rabbitmq-server
3.15 java-client (consumer)
3.04 erlang (producer)
ec2 m1.large
1 durable queue. no exchange.
Producer has 5 connections, each connection holds 20 channels.
Consumer has only 1 connection, who holds 20 channels, autoack = true.

If the publish rate is equal or below 15000msgs/sec, then the consumer can
hold it up (Queue never grows). However, if the publish rate exceeds
15,000, say 18,000 msgs/sec, then the delivery rate will drop to
400~2000/sec, then queue starts paging, blocks producer, and then
everything crashes.

The CPU and memory usages are just fine, but I'm not sure what else could
cause such problem. Bandwidth? Socket buffer size?

Anyone saw this kind of issue before? Any clues? Any other things I should
check?

Thanks,
Zhibo

Hi, Can anyone tell me where can we find RabbitMQ default listening port
and how can we change it???

And as per the documentation using envt variables, I have
changed RABBITMQ_NODE_PORT to custom number 9091. But, how can I check
whether it is changed from default port to 9091 or not?

This line from the trace corresponds to the following line in the source
(assuming you are using a recent version of the client library):

 throw new PossibleAuthenticationFailureException(e);

The broker logfile will probably contain an error message explaining
that incorrect authentication details were provided. That means the
username or password was wrong.

You can inspect the effective configuration by running "rabbitmqctl
environment" and look for the "tcp_listeners" entry. You could also get
the OS process pid of the Erlang VM via "rabbitmqctl status" and query
the listening ports associated with that process via the OS.

It's printed inn the log files, and displayed in the management web 
interface. Or you can telnet to the ports in question. Or use nmap.

Hi,

Are there any roadmap or other info about when 3.2 will be released? I was 
trying to fix one application (mcollective) to use exchanges instead of 
queues (as in 3.1 only exchanges are federated) but then I noticed that 
federated queues are planned feature.

Uploaded test harness to recreate the delays, 
SimultaneousChannelCloseTest.java
<http://rabbitmq.1065348.n5.nabble.com/file/n29973/SimultaneousChannelCloseTest.java> 
. Requires amqp-client-3.1.5.jar. No arguments, just change the RabbitMQ
host, port, vhost, username and password in main(). Example output:



Here 99% of the channels closed in less than 1 second. The remaining 100
channels (equal to the number of threads used) closed in a significantly
longer time. Increasing the number of channels increases the delay but only
for the same number of channels as there are THREADS. Increasing the number
of CONNECTIONS alleviates these delays. You can fiddle with these parameters
in the source.

Having played with this for a few hours now my take is that the initial
channel-closes are simply delayed waiting on other stuff to happen on the
connection. There's lots of publishing and consuming going on. Subsequent
channel-closes are not delayed because they're all queued right behind the
initial closes so there's nothing else really going on. Of course the test
harness can be modified to create connection activity while the closes are
being invoked and the delays will be seen in all channel-closes instead of
just the first few. The channel-close is a synchronous roundtrip operation
so we just have to wait. Maybe what I'm looking for is just a way to close
the channels asynchronously so that I don't have to wait too?

So my thinking is that I have 3 ways to alleviate these delays. 1) Use more
connections. 2) Fire off channel-close asynchronously, ensuring that I don't
try to use the channel subsequently. 3) Modify the Java amqp-client to offer
an asynchronous close that fires off the close and returns, while discarding
anything else received subsequently on that channel until the reply is
received, at which point it cleans up properly with disconnectChannel().

What are your thoughts on an asynchronous close in the amqp-client? Is it
warranted? When should listeners be notified shutdownCompleted()?
Immediately on firing the close or finally when the server reply is
received? Is this just complicating the API and would it lead equivalent
asynchronous operations everywhere else, such as when closing connections?

Thanks, Martin.

This is most likely a consequence of a previous error and not fatal in
itself, but if these errors repeat endlessly that points to a more
serious problem.

Hi,
I am making a consumer framework in java for consuming messages from the
queues.
I am sharing a single rabbitmq connection and channel among 4 threads.
My question is can we store the "delivery.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag()"
in a object while fetching the message from Rabbit and use the same
"delivery.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag()" stored in object for
Acknowledgement after processing of message.
Processing is taking a little more time in our case , So we are thinking of
storing the "delivery.getEnvelope().getDeliveryTag()" in an Object and use
it later for Acknowledgement.
Is it fine to do so or will it casue any issue in application.


Thanks
Saurabh Sharma

I've tested it for a bit and have another question: Is federating
autogenerated (amq.*) queues planned (on current nightly trying to federate
those returns "queue name contains reserved prefix amq") or it is something
that should not be used at all ?

I'm trying to fix mcollective over federated servers, the original code
used very simple method of sending request to exchange with 'reply-to'
header containing name of autogenerated queue, and server then sent reply
to that address. Obviously that didnt work over federation

My first try was just replacing reply queue with direct exchange that
client subscribed to to get replies and it worked partially, over
federation when client did simple
"subscribe(reply_exchange);publish(request_exchange), but sometimes
messages were "lost" probably because server sent reply too fast (before
federation managed to subscribe to remote exchange.

Cheers
Mariusz

I'm a newbie on RabbitMQ.  I'm writing a java service to consume a message 
from the queue.  Everything is working as designed but I cannot seem to 
code "channel.close() or conn.close()" in the catch  or finally block. 
 Java is complaining about that the "cannot find symbol".

symbol  : variable channel
location: class RouteToMercury.javaServices
channel.close();

Can I close the connection and channel if an exception occur?

Thanks for your responses.

Yes, but you must ACK on the same channel that delivered the message in the first place.

I cannot tell you if it will cause any issues in your application, but it is safe in terms of the RabbitMQ java client library.

You probably declared the channel and conn variables in the scope of the
"try" block. Try declaring them before the "try" block.

It's impossible to help with a compiler error if you don't post that code that you're trying to compile.

> Can I close the connection and channel if an exception occur?

Yes, absolutely. The above looks like a scoping issue. I suspect you've done something like...

try {
  final Channel channel = connection.createChannel();
  doSomeWork(channel);
} finally {
  channel.close();
}

Am I right? If so, you need to move the channel variable to the outer scope.

I've attempted to reproduce this problem from your description but did
not succeed. Can supply a network packet capture file of TCP traffic
between the broker and the load-balancer under the conditions that lead
to the leak? Tools such as tcpdump can create such a file.

Thank you everyone and you guys are absolutely correct.  I thought I had to declare the connection and channel inside the try block because exception need to be thrown or caught.

I believe I had tried it once before and had a compiler error because the connection had to be thrown or caught which is why I have it inside the try block.

Okay.  Here's my code:

ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory();
factory.setUri("amqp://guest:guest at host:5672");
Connection conn = factory.newConnection();
Channel channel = conn.createChannel();

Got compiling error:

unreported exception java.net.URISyntaxException; must be caught or 
declared to be thrown
factory.setUri("");
                              ^

Connection conn = factory.newConnection();

Hmm. That's kinda problematic - you shouldn't be able to declare your 
own named queue in the server-generated namespace. But the downstream 
federated queue is just another AMQP client from the perspective of the 
upstream, so it can't violate that requirement.

Not sure if that's the right thing to do, but that's how it is now. Hmm.

Of course, you could have your client generate a reply queue name based 
on a UUID or something, that would get round the problem.

Interesting. I hadn't really thought people would do RPC over federation 
but I think your plan should work.

Yeah, I think that analysis is right.

Thanks for the quick response.

I wanted to measure performance in the presence of JMS interface.So is there
any way to configure the same client with JMS .

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] register_confirm_handler using the Erlang client
Message-ID: <53f11950-2a9d-498f-95c7-bb6a2cb991ff@googlegroups.com>

Hi,
   I'm a Rabbit newbie, I use register_confirm_handler/2 to register a 
handler which deals with confirm-related messages, but it didn't receive 
any acks or nacks.
Then I  add  code1 after amqp_channel:cast(Channel, Publish, Msg), It can 
work. so why? I want to publish msg In the asynchronous mode.  Thanks!!!!

code1:
receive
   Any -> void
end


my code:

deal_confirm(Pid) ->
loop(Pid, S).

loop(Pid, S) ->
receive
#'basic.ack'{delivery_tag = Tag}  ->
io:format("********"),
loop(Pid, S);
#'basic.nack'{delivery_tag = Tag} ->
io:format("XXXXXXXXXXXX");
_ ->
io:format("??????????~n")
end,
loop(Pid, S).  

send_message(_, _, _, 100) ->
void;
send_message(Channel, Publish, Msg, A) ->
amqp_channel:cast(Channel, Publish, Msg),
send_message(Channel, Publish, Msg, A+1).

start() ->
{ok, Connection} = amqp_connection:start(#amqp_params_network{}),
{ok, Channel}    = amqp_connection:open_channel(Connection),
#'confirm.select_ok'{} = amqp_channel:call(Channel, #'confirm.select'{}), 
S = self(),
amqp_channel:register_confirm_handler(Channel, spawn(fun() -> 
deal_confirm(S) end)),
Payload = <<"helloworld">>,
Publish = #'basic.publish'{exchange = <<"infoexchange">>, routing_key = 
<<"info">>},
Props   = #'P_basic'{delivery_mode = 2},
Msg     = #amqp_msg{props = Props, payload = Payload},
send_message(Channel, Publish, Msg, 0),
amqp_channel:close(Channel),
amqp_connection:close(Connection).

The reason is that without "code1" you are publishing a bunch of 
messages and then immediately closing the channel, before the confirms 
have arrived. When you stick that extra receive block in you cause the 
"main" process to hang and not close the channel - as a consequence you 
end up having time to receive the confirms.

Hi, I've got a durable, high availability queue across a cluster of 2 servers that was working fine, but I'm now getting an error related to it when rabbitmq starts:


=ERROR REPORT==== 27-Sep-2013::09:02:35 ===

                                []},

                                 []}}},
                           undefined,undefined,undefined,running}
** Reason for termination ==

                     {rabbit_variable_queue,init,6,[]},

                     {proc_lib,init_p_do_apply,3,
                               [{file,"proc_lib.erl"},{line,239}]}]}

The error started after the rabbitmq servers were each up and down several times over the course of an hour or two.

The high availability policy is:

$ rabbitmqctl -p xsede_public list_policies
Listing policies ...
xsede_public     ha-carnac      ^carnac\\.      {"ha-mode":"all"}       0
...done.

I don't see the queue when I do a:

$ rabbitmqctl -p xsede_public list_queues


In an effort to clean out the problem, I deleted the high availability policy, but that didn't fix things - I got the same error as above, just without the policy information in it. I also tried to just delete the queue by name using amqp, but no luck. Rabbitmqctl sync_queue on that queue also just hung for me.

There may be a bug here for you to look in to, but do you have a suggestion for how I can clear this error?


I'm also getting a 500 error in the management web interface that I assume is caused by the above:

Internal Server Error

The server encountered an error while processing this request:
{error,
    {error,
        {badmatch,false},
        [{rabbit_mgmt_wm_overview,version,1,
             [{file,"rabbitmq-management/src/rabbit_mgmt_wm_overview.erl"},
              {line,73}]},
         {rabbit_mgmt_wm_overview,to_json,2,
             [{file,"rabbitmq-management/src/rabbit_mgmt_wm_overview.erl"},
              {line,39}]},
         {webmachine_resource,resource_call,3,[]},
         {webmachine_resource,do,3,[]},

             [{file,"rabbitmq-web-dispatch/src/rabbit_webmachine.erl"},
              {line,71}]}]}}



Thanks,

Not over STOMP I'm afraid. You might be able to get away with using 
mandatory publishing in AMQP, depending on how things are set up.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ + MVC4 async
Message-ID: <2f4d9278-4712-429c-b412-6c94de3d5835@googlegroups.com>

I have a working MVC4 app that uses RabbitMQ RPC to send work items to a 
RabbitMQ queue and waits for the response.

I am using this pattern (only C# instead of Java): 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-java.html

My question is that MVC4 and .NET 4.5 now support async/await for 
performance improvements.  I would think that while I'm waiting on the 
queue for the RPC response, that the thread could be utilized for other 
things.  

Does the RabbitMQ.Client library (
http://www.nuget.org/packages/RabbitMQ.Client/) support async/await?  If 
so, how can I use it?  If it does not support it now, is it in the plans to 
add support later on?

Thanks,
...Matt

Interesting. We've seen this once before in our testing but have not 
been able to reproduce it.

What RabbitMQ version is this on?

> There may be a bug here for you to look in to

There certainly is. So right now whenever you bounce the node you get 
the above? If so, could you possible send us the contents of the entire 
RABBITMQ_MNESIA_DIR directory? That should allow is to reproduce the 
problem and hopefully track down the cause.

Are you ok with losing the queue and its data? If so we may be able to 
come up with some 'rabbitmqctl eval' magic for you to clear the error.

Matthias.

You need to add the exception to a throws clause or surround the statement with a try-catch.

The messages are being sent from the client and it reaches rabbitmq, but 
they aren't being consumed. The name of the queues are correct. How I 
make the messages being consumed?

Hi,

You could use the firehose tracer to debug your messages while they are
handled by RabbitMQ: http://rabbitmq.com/firehose.html

Take a look at your queue bindings and the routing keys used during
publication to make sure they match.

Regards,

Alvaro

Hi,

First, you have to make sure that the messages are in fact getting queued.
You could do that using rabbitmqctl list_queues or via the management
plugin.

If that's the case, then connect with your consumer and make sure to pass
the appropriate queue name to basic.consume.

Regards,

Alvaro

Hi,

Take a look at the flow control mechanism:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/memory.html

"A per-connection mechanism that prevents messages being published faster
than they can be routed to queues." Perhaps your publishers are hitting
that.

Alvaro

When I do "rabbitmqctl list_queues", nothing appears.
$ rabbitmqctl list_queues
Listing queues ...
...done.


But I have 6 channels. Do I have a misconfiguration? What detail do you 
need to understand what is going on with my problem? I am new in 
rabbitmq, and I don't know how use firehose.

Hi,

Having channels doesn't mean you have queues. To have queues you need to
declare them with your client (either producer or consumer). Take a look at
what you see on the 'queues' tab of the management plugin.

Regarding Celery I never used it so I can't comment on it.

A good introduction to RabbitMQ concepts can be found on our tutorials:
http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html

Cheers,

Alvaro

Hi Alvaro,

Thanks for pointing out this.

But when I checked the connection status from management plugin, only
publisher connections were in 'Flow/Blocked' states, all consumers'
connections were still 'running' but in a very low rate.

And, as far as I know, 15000 msgs/sec is still far from the ceiling (Based
on
http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2012/04/25/rabbitmq-performance-measurements-part-2/
).

Did I miss anything?

Thanks,
Zhibo

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Consumer slows down (a lot) after producer
 exceeds a certain publish rate, why?

Here is a very interesting chart.

Before 22:10, both publisher and consumer were both running in a stable
state (13000msgs/sec);
22:11, I increased the publish rate to 17000msgs/sec;
deliver rate went down while publish rate went up;
22:12, I shut down the publisher, the deliver rate went up high and drained
the all the messages left in queue in seconds.

I know it must be bound by something but I don't know what's that yet. CPU
and memory usage are just fine, and I put queue and consumer in the same
machine so probably bandwidth is not the root cause. Local I/O utilization
was low as well. What else could be the root cause? Any hint will be
appreciated.

btw, Everything looked good when I tested on my local machine
(20000+msgs/sec on both sides without any problem), but when I put them
onto EC2, this thing happens.

Thanks,
Zhibo

I believe this error started when the servers were at version 3.1.1. I also upgraded today to 3.1.5, to confuse things more.

I'll send you the mnesia directory.

Yep, I'm ok with losing the queue and the data. I'd just prefer not to lose the rest of the configuration.

Thanks,


Warren

Are you sure that's from the node on which you see the error?

There are just two durable queues and they are completely empty. I can't 
see how the error would arise under those circumstances.

Emile, did this bug report get merged with another? I do not see the
"bug22061" branch in 'rabbitmq-server'.

That's because we haven't done any work on this bug.

However, supposedly there is a fix in Erlang/OTP R16B. So if you are 
running into this problem and are on an earlier version of Erlang I 
suggest you upgrade and report back.

There should be 4 durable queues on 4 different vhosts, so I'm not sure what happened. The durable queues are typically empty - they only start to fill up if the consumer is down for whatever reason.


I think I mucked around enough that I can't really give you a good error report to track down, unfortunately. So, I broke down the cluster, cleared out all the mnesia data from server 2, deleted the mnesia queue files/directories from server 1, and brought server 1 back up. Server 1 came up ok and I re-created the durable queues there and it seems to be running and routing messages ok. I am seeing several instances of one error in the log file:

=ERROR REPORT==== 28-Sep-2013::10:56:31 ===
** Generic server rabbit_mgmt_external_stats terminating 
** Last message in was emit_update
** When Server state == {state,1024}

    [{rabbit_mgmt_external_stats,i,2,
         [{file,
              "rabbitmq-management-agent/src/rabbit_mgmt_external_stats.erl"},
          {line,146}]},
     {rabbit_mgmt_external_stats,'-infos/2-lc$^0/1-0-',2,
         [{file,
              "rabbitmq-management-agent/src/rabbit_mgmt_external_stats.erl"},
          {line,143}]},
     {rabbit_mgmt_external_stats,'-infos/2-lc$^0/1-0-',2,
         [{file,
              "rabbitmq-management-agent/src/rabbit_mgmt_external_stats.erl"},
          {line,143}]},
     {rabbit_mgmt_external_stats,emit_update,1,
         [{file,
              "rabbitmq-management-agent/src/rabbit_mgmt_external_stats.erl"},
          {line,275}]},
     {rabbit_mgmt_external_stats,handle_info,2,
         [{file,
              "rabbitmq-management-agent/src/rabbit_mgmt_external_stats.erl"},
          {line,263}]},
     {gen_server,handle_msg,5,[{file,"gen_server.erl"},{line,607}]},
     {proc_lib,init_p_do_apply,3,[{file,"proc_lib.erl"},{line,239}]}]}

And the management interface isn't behaving well - the Connections, Channels, Exchanges, Queues pages give me the error below:

{error,
    {error,
        {badrecord,dict},
        [{dict,get_slot,2,[{file,"dict.erl"},{line,396}]},
         {dict,find,2,[{file,"dict.erl"},{line,139}]},
         {rabbit_mgmt_util,id0,2,
             [{file,"rabbitmq-management/src/rabbit_mgmt_util.erl"},
              {line,260}]},
         {rabbit_mgmt_util,vhost,1,
             [{file,"rabbitmq-management/src/rabbit_mgmt_util.erl"},
              {line,116}]},
         {rabbit_mgmt_util,filter_conn_ch_list,3,
             [{file,"rabbitmq-management/src/rabbit_mgmt_util.erl"},
              {line,443}]},
         {rabbit_mgmt_wm_connections,to_json,2,
             [{file,"rabbitmq-management/src/rabbit_mgmt_wm_connections.erl"},
              {line,36}]},
         {webmachine_resource,resource_call,3,[]},
         {webmachine_resource,do,3,[]}]}}

Any suggestions on how to fix this one? I did try to delete the -plugins-expand mnesia directory and restart in case there was some bad data in there, but that didn't do anything.

Thanks again,


Warren

	extensions
Message-ID: <CAMcAHLVO4RPJ9BFZQC4WgyqzJGNJFfynDkO6LcKZY5TvKSudvw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The current master version of php-amqplib adds support for the current
protocol extensions:

- publisher_confirms
- consumer_cancel_notify
- exchange_exchange_bindings
- basic.nack

Get it here https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib or via Composer.

Example for publisher confirms:
https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib/blob/master/demo/amqp_publisher_with_confirms.php

Example for consumer cancel notify:
https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib/blob/master/demo/basic_cancel.php

Example for Exchange to Exchange bindings:
https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib/blob/master/demo/e2e_bindings.php

Example for basic.nack:
https://github.com/videlalvaro/php-amqplib/blob/master/demo/basic_nack.php

Apart from that there has been a few performance improvements that might be
worth testing as well.

A big thanks to all the contributors! I hope to make a new release during
next week.

Regards,

Alvaro

That's unfortunate and likely means we won't be able to track down and 
fix the error you originally reported :(

This suggests that somehow the plugins are out of date. Which of course 
should be impossible with any of our packages since they come with the 
plugins bundled, but the fact that you got line numbers in the error 
above suggests that you may not be running with our standard packages.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Getting the routing key from connection (web
	stomp)
Message-ID: <0290a0ff-00ec-4b42-a61f-5912ff23ec6d@googlegroups.com>

Hi

I need to get a handle on the routing key for the generated temporary queue 
when using web stomp. I can't get that from the JavaScript side.

My desired scenario for my event driven app.
1) Browser client opens a websocket connection to rabbitmq web stomp
2) When calling client.connect, the routing key is made available (example: 
amq.gen-oQVllULAASDvZdXsxFADHg). *Not working today?*
3) The client can the send a HTTP REST request to our API with a command. 
Attaches the routing key from the previous step.
4) The request returns immediately after the message is delivered processed 
and placed on a queue.
5) After the server side processing is done (multiple systems involved), 
the routing key is finally used and the result is published back to the 
browser

I do not wish to send messages to the server from the browser over stomp, 
since we already have our REST API I want to use that. I already have 
strong authentication implemented there.

There is a fan-out exchange that all clients subscribe to. But I mostly 
want to send messages to one dedicated client at a time.

The documentation is very scarce on Web Stomp and I'm new to RabbitMQ and 
not particularly Erlang proficient. So I need some pointers. 

Also, if there is a smarter way to do it, please do tell.

Best regards and thanks in advance!
/Magnus

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] problem with ncreasing response times
Message-ID: <CAFztWsv17jz+27B-rcbKLa=5RtH+sRUT7kj42gkNt=HZZROiig@mail.gmail.com>

We use rabbitmq 3.1.5. This is installed on a red hat linux server (6.4),
the same server where our application is also running. The database
(postgresql) is on a separate server.

I ran a test where concurrent users post to a rest service (say R). This
service basically expects  two UUIDs (UUID_A and UUID_B), that identify two
database entities  A and B. Once the service is called with these two
values, it publishes to the default exchange. There are two queues bound to
this exchange. QueueA and QueueB. Two services,  Service A and Service B,
each listen on QueueA and QueueB respectively.  There are no other
consumers to these queues. Service A picks up the message and validates  UUID_A
exists in the database. Service B validates UUID_B exists. If they are both
valid, an entry is made to the db, mapping these two values.
I find as the test progresses, response  time of this overall post
increases.  A lot of the time is being spent in  Unsafe.park (boolean,long)
in sun.misc package.
Here is the call stack that shows classes where this being involved from.
It appears to be called from spring framework?s RabbitTemplate class.

Unsafe.park

-LockSupportparkNanos(Object,Long)



As the test progresses where the load increases from 50 users to 200 users
over a period of 20 mins, this response time increases from 50 ms to almost
2 seconds. 99% of the response time is spent in Unsafe.park.

Why is this so ? It looks like there is a wait for some resource lock. I am
not sure why this wait increases with time/ load.

We are using  rabbitMQ default configuration. Everyone is new to rabbitMQ,
so we haven?t changed any of the default parameters.



Also is there a plug-in to monitor cpu usage on the broker ?

Thanks

We are new to rabbitMQ. We use rabbitmq 3.1.5 in our test environment. This
is installed on a red hat linux server (6.4), the same server where our
application is also running. The database (postgresql) is on a separate
server.
We are using rabbitMQ default configuration.
I ran a test where concurrent users post to a rest service (say R). This
service basically expects  two UUIDs (UUID_A and UUID_B), that identify two
database entities  A and B. Once the service is called with these two
values, it publishes to the default exchange.
There are two durable queues bound to this exchange. QueueA and QueueB. Two
services,  Service A and Service B, each listen on QueueA and QueueB
respectively.  There are no other consumers to these queues. Service A
picks up the message and validates  UUID_A exists in the database. Service
B validates UUID_B exists. If they are both valid, an entry is made to the
db, mapping these two values. So each valid post results in an entry in a
table in the db.

I find as the test progresses, response  time of this post increases.  A
lot of the time is being spent in  Unsafe.park (boolean,long)  in sun.misc
package.

Here is the call stack that shows classes where this Unsafe.park() is being
involved from. It appears to be called from spring framework?s
RabbitTemplate class.

Unsafe.park

 LockSupportparkNanos(Object,Long)

  * **AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject.awaitNanos(long)*

     ArrayBlockingQueue.poll(long, TimeUnit)

        RabbitTemplate$3.doInRabbit(Channel)

           RabbitTemplate$3.doInRabbit(Channel)

RabbitTemplate.execute(ChannelCallback)

  * **RabbitTemplate.doSendAndReceiveWithTemporary(String,String,Message)*

      RabbitTemplate.doSendAndReceive(String,String,Message)

         RabbitTemplate.convertSendAndReceive(String,String,Object,
MessagePostProcessor)


RabbitTemplate.convertSendAndReceive(String,Object)

?

           ?

As the test progresses where the load increases from 50 users to 200 users
over a period of 20 mins, this response time increases from 50 ms to almost
2 seconds. 99% of the response time is spent in Unsafe.park (waiting).  At
the end of 20 mins, roughly 100,000 entries are made into the db.That is
roughly 83 Posts (i.e messages) per second. Each message contains a couple
of UUIDs and a couple of dates. There is no other activity on this server.
Why is there so mcuh time being spent in Unsafe.park() ? It looks like
there is a wait for some resource lock. How can we reduce this wait ?
Overall CPU is about 40-45% on this box (a 12 core server). 2/3rds of this
time is being spent in the rabbitMQ server.
Is there a plug-in to monitor cpu usage on the server? How can we determine
where time is being spent within the broker ?

Thanks,

By default, the RabbitTemplate.*sendAndReceive() operations create a
temporary reply queue for each request. This is not particularly efficient
for high volume situations.

Consider using a fixed reply queue in these situations.

One consumer can only consume from a single queue. You can reuse delivery
handler between multiple consumers (that are not QueueingConsumer instances)
or create an entity that aggregates messages from
two QueueingConsumer instances.

You may be declaring queues as exclusive, then they will be removed when the connection
that declared them closes (possibly due to a network partition, not application action).

Or you may be declaring them as auto-delete, in which case they are removed when the last
consumer is cancelled.

Finally, queues can have fixed life time.

One way is to detect failures you can recover from (e.g. network failures), reconnect and recover (redeclare, rebind)
your topology. This varies from client to client, e.g. Ruby and Clojure clients support automatic recovery while
Java client requires developers to explicitly inspect shutdown reason.

If you connect to RabbitMQ over WAN, you may want to run a local node and connect it to the
remote WAN one with Shovel [1] and use the local node. Shovel will recover from network failures
gracefully and connection loss with a LAN-local machine is less likely.

> 2. My message from client is not getting delivered to the server and they reside at Server queues(ready state). If I try sending message again from client, my server listener is not able to receive  any more client messages as the client published messages are getting accumulated in server ready queue. 

The first screenshot indicates that there are delivered messages but they are not acknowledged.
The second one only has queues with messages ready. Are the two states related two each other?

Did you check that the queues with messages have consumers? If you use basic.get instead of
basic.consume, then it sounds like a consumer application issue.

The sources of the library are available here:
http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/

Since it originally targetted .NET 1.1, the library does not make use of
more modern asynchronous programming support. We are aware that this is
an opportunity for improvement in the future. In most cases though
threading represents a minor contribution to the performance profile of
the library.

Hi Michael,

FYI my design pattern of queues as follows:

Server <---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Client

{Listen Queue:                                                                    {Simple Publish with routing key:
Durable =1,                                                                            mandatory =0, immediate =0 }
renaming all properties = 0,
no_ack =0; using amqp_basic_ack()
for giving ACK}


Server -----------------------------------------------------------------------------> Client
{Simple Publish with routing key:                                           {Listen Queue: AutoDelete =1,
mandatory =0, immediate =0 }                                              remaining all properties = 0, no_ack =1}

The issues I am facing is as follows:

1. Binding Key messing:
--------------------------------
I have my client on different network and having DHCP configuration.

1. BUT I am observing that my client listener queues(at server) is getting removed(vanished) even I am not shutting down my client app. What could be the reason?

My app is an app which supposed to be run 24x7x356. same for server as well. How to establish reliable connection between server and client so that there should not be any communication break ? Please suggest.

2. My message from client is not getting delivered to the server and they reside at Server queues(ready state). If I try sending message again from client, my server listener is not able to receive  any more client messages as the client published messages are getting accumulated in server ready queue.

For better clarity please refer the screen shot of Management console.

Rohit

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Suggestion for enabling users view data in

Being able to view queue contents in a random-access manner is not very 
compatible with the existing behaviour of RabbitMQ queues where they can 
be paged out to disk (yes, it would be possible, but it would be a huge 
job and not exactly likely to be fast).

You can currently kinda-sorta view contents of queues in the management 
interface - this works behind the scenes by consuming the messages 
without acknowledgement, then requeueing them. This doesn't scale well 
to huge numbers of messages.

It's unclear whether there would be any use for a limited queue browsing 
feature in between these two cases - something that could list messages 
that happen to be in memory but not those that are paged out. 
Conceivably there could be but it's not really top of our list of 
priorities right now.

Cheers, Simon

While you say that CPU usage is fine, bear in mind that a single queue 
can only use one CPU core at once.

It is quite possible that you are simply giving the queue too much work 
to do. (And you're not hitting its limit when testing on your own 
machine because that's faster than a large EC2 instance.)

Unfortunately when a queue is CPU-limited we don't guarantee that it 
will prioritise delivering messages to consumers over accepting messages 
from publishers. We used to, but this can have undesirable consequences 
in other contexts (a large queue which suddenly got consumers could use 
100% of its CPU draining, thus blocking publishers for potentially a 
long time). So in particular if you have a decent number of publishers 
it's possible to just overwhelm the queue.

If you are able to split your work up across several queues I suspect 
that would help a lot.

Cheers, Simon

Ah....Maybe that's why

I will do more investigations on the CPU usage for each core and split all
msgs into several different queues to see if that will help.

Thanks a lot Simon, It's really helpful.

Hello All,
I am newbie in RabbitMQ. Previously I was using RabbitMQ 2.7 version.
Recently I upgraded to 3. 1.5 version.
When I installed this new version I started getting following error when I
run my Python program.
/socket.error: [Errno 107] Transport endpoint is not connected/

Also when I fire command : rabbitmqctl list_queues
It will show warning message as : ls: cannot access
/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf.d: No such file or directory
and then show the list. I don't understand what happen ? Please guide me.

This means client cannot connect to RabbitMQ. One reason may be that the
node is not running. Another is that authentication failed and your client
either did not report the exception properly or the exception was swallowed.

What client do you use?

You can create /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf.d with rabbitmq user permissions
to avoid this warning. If queues are listed, it has no effect on rabbitmqctl operation.

Hello Michael Klishin,

My program starts fine and run for few seconds well and then after some
time, it will show this error.
So I guess if the client cann't connect to RabbitMQ, then it will show this
error at the first time when the application invoked.

>What client do you use?
I had written Python multi threaded program which uses 'amqplib 1.0.2' ( 3rd
party library for Python) to create this application.

Take a look at RabbitMQ log when that happens and post any messages
you find to the list.

Not necessarily, the client can use fairly high (e.g. several seconds) socket
timeouts.

Then it can be a concurrency issue that causes RabbitMQ to close the connection
(e.g. incorrect frame interleaving when publishing). RabbitMQ log will help prove
or disprove this hypothesis.

Also, have you considered using Pika instead? It is a significantly more widely used
and better maintained client.

Hello Michael Klishin,

In log I found following error :

=ERROR REPORT==== 30-Sep-2013::13:59:39 ===
AMQP connection <0.261.0> (running), channel 1 - error:
{amqp_error,unexpected_frame,
            "expected content header for class 60, got non content header
frame instead",
            'basic.publish'}


I can't use Pika, since I am using Rabbit MQ within my application.

In the same moment I stopped keepalived the memory stabilize.

I attach the tcpdump output for 61613 port. ( it should be just keepalived
connections from the other balanced
server, as this cluster has no queues )

So yes, RabbitMQ closes the connection due to a connection-level error
with frame interleaving. It's very likely that you are publishing on the same
channel from multiple threads. This is a bad idea (unless you take care of
synchronization in your own code).

To be more specific: every time you publish a non-empty message,
your client sends 3 (or more) frames on the wire:

[method: basic.publish] [content headers] [content body]+

When publishing on the same channel from multiple threads,
you may end up with incorrect interleaving, e.g.

[method: basic.publish] [content headers] [method: basic.publish] [content body] [content headers] [content body]

RabbitMQ cannot parse this frame sequence and raises a fatal error. The solution
is to either

 * Avoid publishing on *the same* channel from multiple threads
 * Synchronize publishing in your own code

Sorry, this does not make sense to me. Pika is the RabbitMQ client used in the official
tutorials:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html

I highly recommend giving Pika a try if you communicate RabbitMQ from a Python app.

Yep, that was it: I had old plugins in the directory in addition to the new versions. Thanks.

I think I sent you all the data I had on that error, unfortunately. The error messages and the mnesia db from the one node. If it comes up again, I'll save the errors and dbs from all the nodes before I start trying things.

Hello ..
We are looking into Rabbit MQ message broker for our message needs.. Looks like Rabbit MQ support external different backing stores / databases for message durability..  I couldn't find any help/document/tutorial on how to use or configure external database instead of default file store.. Have anyone implemented this if so how does the performance look..
Any help is highly appreciated ... Thank you..

Take a look at [1] and [2].

Implementing your own storage is possible but is not trivial and likely will not be worth the effort
for most projects. Using a custom message index implementation to reduce RAM
usage is much easier, see [2].

Hello Michael Klishin,

Thanks a ton.
Use of synchronization works for me. Thanks a lot for the suggestion.

Please file an issue with the client you are using about raising visible exceptions
in case RabbitMQ closes the connection due to a connection-level exception.

Thanks.. We don't want to handle the storage through code .. we wanted to see if rabbit mq has some option where we can point it to a database so the messages gets stored during the node crash's so that the other nodes in the cluster can pick the message and process ..

We are looking at a design where we have a clustered env with multiple nodes and has a single DB for message durability so that node failures doesn't delay the message processing ... My assumption is when we have a file store for message durability and if one of the node goes down in the cluster the messages not been consumed yet must have been stored in that node file system and will stay till the node is back up ... those message will not be accessible by other active nodes in the cluster because the file store for that node is not accessible to other nodes....and the messages will be delayed ...

I am not sure how this scenario is handled ...seems to be a common problem..

Using mirrored queues or asynchronous replication (using Shovel or Federation plugins).

In my case the Client is developed by one of my co-worker.
I had asked him to made the same change.
Thank you.

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] mirrored cluster crashes after node failure
Message-ID: <53507612-76b6-4788-a83a-a7169bf85349@googlegroups.com>

We have a 3 node rabbitmq cluster consisting of 2 disk nodes and one memory 
node.  (disk nodes are rabbitmq-00 and 01, memory node is core-01) 

queues are durable and mirrored (show +2 in control panel, etc.) and show 
syncronized:

# rabbitmqctl list_queues name slave_pids synchronised_slave_pids
Listing queues ...
...
SVC_mailbox_lookup [<'rabbit at rabbitmq-01'.2.301.0>, 
<'rabbit at core-01'.1.268.0>] [<'rabbit at core-01'.1.268.0>, 
<'rabbit at rabbitmq-01'.2.301.0>]
...

#  rabbitmqctl list_policies
Listing policies ...
/ ha-all ^SVC_ {"ha-mode":"all"} 0
...done.


We put in SSD mounted to '/var/lib/rabbitmq' to host the mnesia database on 
rabbitmq-00/01.  we only did a single drive figuring that if the disk 
failed the node would crash and the others in the HA cluster would take 
over - all clients have been coded for failover.

The SSD on rabbitmq-00 failed.   i don't have logs of that event from 
rabbitmq-00's point of view - for some reason it didn't write out anything.

I do have it from rabbitmq-01's:

=INFO REPORT==== 26-Sep-2013::16:07:20 ===
Mirrored-queue (queue 'SVC_mailbox_lookup' in vhost '/'): Slave <'
rabbit at rabbitmq-01'.3.785.0> <rabbit at 4c-rabbitmq-01'.3.785.0>> saw deaths 
of mirrors <'rabbit at rabbitmq-00'.3.1415.0><rabbit at 4c-rabbitmq-00'.3.1415.0>> 

=INFO REPORT==== 26-Sep-2013::16:07:20 ===
Mirrored-queue (queue 'SVC_mailbox_lookup' in vhost '/'): Promoting slave <'
rabbit at rabbitmq-01'.3.785.0> <rabbit at 4c-rabbitmq-01'.3.785.0>> to master

but then:

=ERROR REPORT==== 26-Sep-2013::16:17:17 ===
connection <0.487.0>, channel 1 - soft error:
{amqp_error,not_found,
"home node 'rabbit at core-01' of durable queue 'SVC_mailbox_lookup' in vhost 
'/' is down or inaccessible",
'queue.declare'}

This is repeated for each queue. 

It looks like rabbitmq-01 took over as master, but then the nodes become 
non-responsive because they can't write to disk on core-01 (the memory 
node.)

we shutdown whatever was still running on rabbitmq-00.   and everything was 
still unavailable.  we then shutdown core-01 and lastly rabbitmq-01, then 
restarted rabbitmq-01, but it came up with NO queues.   

is this an error with the way the HA cluster is handling failover or an 
error with our configurations - should we not mix memory and disk nodes in 
an HA cluster?   

I'm trying to figure this our because we want to be sure that if any node 
in the cluster fails, the others take over seamlessly.  our code does 
that... we just need the clusters to soldier on and that no records are 
lost.

Thanks.
