That is usually an anti-pattern since it's racy. Another client might 
create/remove the exchange after the passive declaration. Just actively 
declare the exchange instead.

&gt;<i> Now the problem:

</I>
AMQP only has two kinds of errors - those that close that channel and 
those that close the connection. Channel creation/closure is quite cheap 
in rabbit, so the former type of errors are quite lightweight.

Now, perhaps passive declaration should return a not-found response 
rather than a not-found error, but the protocol is what it is.

&gt;<i> Questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - What is the added value of the Exchange.DeclareOk result?
</I>
So you know that the operation has completed successfully.

&gt;<i> - Why is there no API call available to check if an exchange exists (and
</I>&gt;<i> with which parameters) so that this exception can be prevented?
</I>
As noted above, just perform an active declaration instead.

I have yet to find a genuine use case for passive declarations. But the 
operations are defined in the protocol and quite easy to implement, so 
rabbit supports them.

Matthias.
