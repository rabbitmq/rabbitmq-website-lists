<PRE>Hi Shane,

Apologies for the near-month-long delay - this one seemed to slip
through somewhat.

No. A and B should be consuming from their own queues and then
republishing as necessary such that their published messages end up on
separate queues to which C is subscribed. C can detect which
subscription a message is coming from - indeed that's the purpose of the
consumer tag. Thus C will be able to detect when a message comes from A
or if it comes from B.

&gt;<i> I should also mention that C may or may not be necessary based on the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> data(x): A, B
</I>&gt;<i> data(y): A, B, C
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So in the case of data(x), C is not needed and in the case of data(y)
</I>&gt;<i> C needs the results of A and B.
</I>
How is this determined? If all the messages from A and B flow through C,
can C work this out and just fail to do any further work, or does A and
B know this, in which case they could avoid publishing their transformed
messages?
