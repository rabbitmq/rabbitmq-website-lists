<PRE>  Hello all!

I'm writing a consumer that read logs from RabbitMQ and write them 
into a database.
To ensure that all my logs are correctly copied from RabbitMQ to the 
database, I acknowledge them only once they have been written (this 
way, if the consumer is killed, it will the logs once again on restart).

But from time to time, the database blocks during 30s to 1minute and 
thus I don't acknowledge during the same time.

It seems that the RabbitMQ server closes the connection. Is there a 
timeout (or a setting) I can use to fix this issue ?

My consumer is written in Java and is using the rabbitmq client library.

Thanks for your help.

</PRE>
