It's unimplemented - there were several such classes in the 0.8 spec
which were bizarre and not obviously different from the basic class. We
did not implement them, and they were removed in 0.9.1 spec. If you have
really big files that you need to pass around then I'd suggest placing
them somewhere else (pretty much anything will do here - NFS even!), and
then passing pointers (URLs, Paths etc) as the message in Rabbit.
