<PRE>It didn't occur to me that the failure could have arisen after the
routing but during the consumption stage of my passive listener.  I
don't think that's the case, but here's what the broker reported which
I intended to include in my first email:

  class_id: 90
  method_id: 20
  reply_code: 541
  reply_text: &quot;INTERNAL_ERROR - commit failed:
[{&lt;0.25498.0&gt;,{exit,{queue_disappeared,&lt;0.25498.0&gt;},[{rabbit_amqqueue,'-commit_all/3-fun-0-',1},{delegate,safe_invoke,2},{delegate,'-safe_invoke/2-lc$^0/1-0-',2},{delegate,'-safe_invoke/2-lc$^0/1-0-',2},{delegate,delegat...&quot;

&gt;&gt;<i> I see that 0.9.1 of the spec adds queue.unbind(). &#160;Is that the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way to avoid this problem, or is there another approach that we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> take?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see how queue.unbind would help -- would you explain?
</I>
I imagine that I could unbind my listener's queue, wait for a bit,
then safely delete the queue and the broker would no longer be trying
to route to it.

cheers,
Aaron

&gt;<i> Hi Aaron,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've confirmed that transactions are being aborted due to a queue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being deleted using an easily-reproducible test case.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The base-case is an exchange and a 1-1 mapping of a routing key to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> destination queue. &#160;The client is simply consuming a published message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then publishing the next one. &#160;A single client as a consumer is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough to repeat the bug.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We then have a test client which we can use to attach to an exchange
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using a supplied routing key. &#160;It will create its own queue and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> act as a passive listener, for easy monitoring of traffic. &#160;The queue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it uses is set to auto-delete. In high-traffic situations, I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> occasionally see a transaction error in the client.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I setup a test case today where a listener would open a connection and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> queue, listen for 2 seconds, then disconnect. &#160;I tried combinations of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> auto_delete enabled and disabled, both with and without an explicit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> queue delete call, as well as using transactions and re-using a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> connection versus closing and reconnecting. &#160;I would run this test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> listener while a test client simply published a message to itself
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every time it received one. &#160;The client is using transactions,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> committing after each publish call. &#160;Within a few minutes, no matter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how my listener was configured, the client would receive a transaction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> error. &#160;I repeated this with the 1.8.0 release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like there's two races going on here:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- the queue being autodeleted, and the transaction committing; and
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- the connection dropping, and the transaction committing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the first case, the transaction commit fails because the queue has gone
</I>&gt;<i> away and it can no longer route the message to it. &#160;I'm less certain about
</I>&gt;<i> the second; I think it may be because the queue tries to deliver the message
</I>&gt;<i> on tx.commit, and the connection drops while that's happening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The AMQP spec doesn't say a lot about the properties of transactions, and in
</I>&gt;<i> particular, whether routing &quot;happens&quot; before or after tx.commit. &#160;RabbitMQ
</I>&gt;<i> routes before the tx.commit, mainly so that persistent messages will land on
</I>&gt;<i> disk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be well within the spec to *act* as though routing happened after
</I>&gt;<i> tx.commit; e.g., the transaction wouldn't fail because your autodelete queue
</I>&gt;<i> has gone away. &#160;We'd also have to be careful of the second case, that
</I>&gt;<i> failing to deliver the message didn't cause the tx.commit to fail. &#160;That's
</I>&gt;<i> probably a more useful semantics overall, anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (We actually already have a bug for looking into this -- thanks for bringing
</I>&gt;<i> back to our attention!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I see that 0.9.1 of the spec adds queue.unbind(). &#160;Is that the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way to avoid this problem, or is there another approach that we can
