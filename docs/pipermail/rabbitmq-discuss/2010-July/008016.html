<PRE>Yes, this confirms the issue I was worrying about. 

 

I think it would be very valuable to add NTLM authentication to Rabbit
on Windows, so that only a username could be supplied on the client and
the authentication verified on the server, without the need to pass
clear-text passwords or per-user SSL certificates. This would really
enhance the commercial attractiveness of Rabbit.

 

Anyone want to take up the challenge?

 

Dan.

Really depends on what your needs are.

 

You could have one cert per user, and use the same authentication
information in your rabbit cloud for all users. I just noticed however
that the erlang new_ssl implementation does not support CRLs, so you
won't be able to revoke a certificate and have that reflected by an
authentication failure on the rabbit server.

 

Wonder what the odds of adding CRL or OCSP support to rabbit
are....There was a thread about this in 2009:
<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2009-July/004189.ht">http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2009-July/004189.ht</A>
ml

 

Both these functionalities are pretty trivial to implement using the
openssl library

 

So I guess my original suggestion doesn't fly as a good solution, sorry!

Would I need a separate certificate for each user? Does peer certificate
verification bypass normal username and password checking?

You could use PKI and store the certificates in LDAP. Have your app use
the current credentials of the user to grab the certificate and connect
to rabbit over SSL with peer certificate verification enabled.

Hi,

 

We have a number of Windows users who want to use our rabbitmq
messaging. However we need to ensure that we authenticate them without
them having to enter their Windows passwords and syncing with the
rabbitmq user passwords.

 

Has anyone looked at a mechanism for using SSPI authentication to allow
clients to connect? This is surely a common challenge, particularly in
an organisation where there are large numbers of users and the job of
providing and maintaining separate passwords for different systems is
hugs.

 

Thanks,

 

Dan Wise
