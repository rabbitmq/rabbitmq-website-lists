<PRE>Christian,

Actually you can still use server-named queues, just don't make them 
exclusive. The clients would need to remember the names of the queues 
they created though, so they can re-attach to them when reconnecting.

Another option is to get the clients to generate cryptographically 
strong names for their queue based on a one-way hash of some easily 
obtainable constant information. Then the clients wouldn't have to 
record the names.

Hmmm. I wonder whether you are actually using the new persister. What hg 
version of the server are you running? One tell-tale sign of the new 
persister is the following messages near the beginning of the rabbit log:

=INFO REPORT==== 18-Jul-2010::08:50:14 ===
msg_store_transient: using rabbit_msg_store_ets_index to provide index

=INFO REPORT==== 18-Jul-2010::08:50:14 ===
msg_store_persistent: using rabbit_msg_store_ets_index to provide index

Do you see these?


Regards,

Matthias
