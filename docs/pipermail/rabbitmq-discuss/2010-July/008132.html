Well, channels are stateful so for example you either have a
transactional channel or a non transactional channel. That's a reason to
have multiple channels. Also if you want different qos settings in
different channels then that's a reason, also the meaning of
ack{multiple=true} is obviously scoped by the non-acked msgs received in
each channel. Thus there are some reasons to have multiple channels. But
generally creating a pool of them or connections is, as Alex says, a bad
idea.
