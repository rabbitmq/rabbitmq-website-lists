<PRE>&gt;<i> Channel.flow has been asserted and therefore the basic.publish call has
</I>&gt;<i> blocked. We are aware that our API documentation is incorrect in
</I>&gt;<i> claiming that basic.publish is safe to use in the given context. This
</I>&gt;<i> will be updated.
</I>
So this probably only happens when rabbit thinks it's overloaded?

&gt;<i> You need to enable consumption of messages while publishers are
</I>&gt;<i> potentially blocked. This will allow memory pressure on the broker to be
</I>&gt;<i> relieved and publishers to resume eventually. In your example
</I>&gt;<i> consumption and publication happens in the same thread and therefore
</I>&gt;<i> your application gets completely stuck as soon as publication blocks.
</I>
So is it safe to publish messages on a channel when some other thread
is consuming on that channel?  If I acquire a lock on the channel in a
different thread, and the channel blocks in basicPublish, will that
still allow new messages to be delivered to the consumer?

&gt;<i> You could also consider using separate channels for publishing and
</I>&gt;<i> consuming messages.
</I>
I'm currently doing acks and publishes in a transaction, but I'm not
sure if that's entirely necessary.  It's certainly convenient and
safe, but I don't know that I really need to do it.  Are acks
guaranteed not to block the way that publishes do?  I obviously can't
send my acks on a different channel :)
