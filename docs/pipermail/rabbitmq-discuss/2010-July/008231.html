Speaking as someone who did work on this, that's basically it.

In theory each of the four bytes after &quot;AMQP&quot; have meaningful semantics. 
However, each version of the AMQP standard seems to manage to assign 
them *different* semantics, so in practice we just pattern-match.

The standards say[0]:

AMQP1180 = 0-8
AMQP1109 = 0-9
AMQP0091 = 0-9-1

And yes, that's not exactly a regular pattern there, but that's what the 
specs say.

However, we weren't aware that there were clients out there in the wild 
sending even odder handshakes. Unfortunately the 0-8 handshake code that 
was in RabbitMQ up till Friday was quite lax; accepting either 0-8, or 
any version that claimed to be higher than 0-8 by the 0-8 semantics of 
each of the bytes. Hence AMQP1191 was accepted, and treated as 0-8. Now 
we're stricter, and reject it.

I'm not sure what the best approach is. Our goal was for 0-9-1 support 
to just appear and work, and not inconvenience any existing 0-8 users. 
With that in mind, I suspect we'll end up adding a workaround for 
py-amqplib, treating AMQP1191 as 0-8. But not until Monday :) Of course, 
py-amqplib should be fixed too.

Cheers, Simon

[0] Whenever I write AMQPabcd, please treat the four digits as byte 
values not ASCII characters.
