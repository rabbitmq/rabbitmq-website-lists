<PRE>Not completely sure what the problems our operations folks had... but they tried 
EPEL but couldn't get Rabbit to work on that. They may have been simple errors 
but were not easy to troubleshoot since none of them were familiar with Erlang 
and it's error logs are pretty hard to read. 


Eventually, they compiled erlang   R13B4 from scratch and used rabbitmq generic 
linux version. Either   way, this is not a problem anymore, since we're up and 
running. 


I   would rather appreciate hearing people's thoughts on my questions.
