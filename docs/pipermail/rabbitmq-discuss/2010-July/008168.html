I would like to chime in that it wasn't painful at all for me to install on a (fairly lean) VM of RHEL 5.5, which I think is the same as CentOS 5.5....here are my (sparse, old) notes:

* Couldn't find a rpm, looked for 5 mins (RHEL 5.5)
* Downloaded <A HREF="http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_R13B04.tar.gz">http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_R13B04.tar.gz</A>
* unzipped, configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
* failed with:
    configure: error: /bin/sh '/source/otp_src_R13B04/erts/configure' failed for erts
* yum install ncurses-devel
* configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
* Installed to /usr/local/{bin,lib/erlang} (default)

I then create my own RabbitMQ rpm from source and install it (slightly more involved as there are more deps and the python on 5.5 is ancient, but not hard).  I can try to provide notes if someone wants them.

Is there a particular step you had issues with? Were you creating a rpm (or trying to find one in the assorted repos) for erlang instead?

Christian
