<PRE>Matthew,

We are running Rabbit 1.8.1 and Erlang R13B03 on Windows and using the
.NET libraries to connect over SSL. To simplify matters I am running the
broker and client on the same machine. BTW I am using OpenSSL 0.9.8 to
enable the Erlang SSL binaries. Not sure if this will make a difference.

I also tried the Erlang R14A release but this failed in a different way
altogether, so I decided to revert back to testing on R13B03 in order to
focus on one failure scenario at a time.

Dan.

Hi Dan,

What version of Rabbit and Erlang are you using? - the Erlang SSL module
has changed a lot recently and the last version we noticed worked well
for us was in Erlang R13B03. It's possible the SSL module has changed to
such an extent that we need to rewrite some of our code to work properly
with R13B04 or the BETA R14A, but we've not recently taken a look at
this.

Matthew
