<PRE>Just to comment, it took me about an hour to set up (the latest at the
time) rabbitmq on CentOS 5.  I wrote a blog post about it here, maybe
it'll be helpful:
<A HREF="http://developingthedream.blogspot.com/2009/10/rabbitmq-erlang-client-yay.html">http://developingthedream.blogspot.com/2009/10/rabbitmq-erlang-client-yay.html</A>

You can ignore the whole new project part, but installing rabbitmq
itself is fairly straightforward.
For management, there's Alice:

Apparently, with the new persister, rabbitmq can save messages to disk
before any crashes.  You can read more about it here:
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/faq.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/faq.html</A>

However, I personally use a backup message storing system (PostgreSQL)
and redeliver undelivered messages (my queues are not durable.)  This
however makes for extra code.

Others might provide more insight, but that's my 2 cents from my
particular usage case.

&gt;<i> Hey all,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've presenting RabbitMQ as a solution to the powers that be on Monday and I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to know about your experiences with using RabbitMQ in high volume
</I>&gt;<i> environment needing guaranteed delivery.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Erlang VM/RabbitMQ management: It was a breeze for me to get RabbitMQ running
</I>&gt;<i> on Ubuntu (&lt;10m) but our &#160;operations folks had a lot of trouble getting
</I>&gt;<i> Erlang/RabbitMQ installed &#160;on CentOs (&gt;5hrs). I haven't run into any issues in
</I>&gt;<i> our QA environment yet, but it's not very high volume. What type of issues
</I>&gt;<i> should I expect in a production environment with regards to managing the Erlang
</I>&gt;<i> VM and RabbitMQ in general? I'm looking at it from the perspective of having a
</I>&gt;<i> game-plan for what to do when things go wrong and to have runbooks for
</I>&gt;<i> operations people to follow for solving common and known problems that come up
</I>&gt;<i> in day-to-day management of Erlang VM and RabbitMQ.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. HA/Failover: I've seen the Pacemaker guide but I'm a little hesitant to set
</I>&gt;<i> that up as we have little experience in house with Pacemaker/Corosync/DRBD. How
</I>&gt;<i> many people use it for HA/Failover in production systems and how happy are you
</I>&gt;<i> with it? Does it support failing over if the hard drive on one of the nodes die
</I>&gt;<i> instead something a little more simple like a node running out of memory or
</I>&gt;<i> hanging?
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Out of the box live failover: I've read in a few places on site that this is
</I>&gt;<i> coming in a future release? Do we have an idea of how far off this is (3 months?
</I>&gt;<i> 6 months? or too far off to speculate?)
</I>&gt;<i> 4. What tools do you use for broker administration in production environments?
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone use BQL and have a good experience running it without any issues in
</I>&gt;<i> a high volume/guaranteed delivery environment? It's not yet officially released
</I>&gt;<i> so I don't want to run it in a production environment. If not, how do you
</I>&gt;<i> manage? Tools built in-house? Is it even possible to do that without resorting
</I>&gt;<i> to programming Erlang?
</I>&gt;<i> 5. How do you monitor RabbitMQ nodes and what do you monitor for (I'm thinking
</I>&gt;<i> of monitoring various queue sizes)? The Zenoss AMQP Plugin looks interesting to
</I>&gt;<i> us, but I have been informed that it's not playing nice with latest Zenoss.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any other thoughts that come to mind... please feel free to share.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks much,
</I>&gt;<i>
