<PRE>Would I need a separate certificate for each user? Does peer certificate
verification bypass normal username and password checking?

 

Dan.

You could use PKI and store the certificates in LDAP. Have your app use
the current credentials of the user to grab the certificate and connect
to rabbit over SSL with peer certificate verification enabled.

Hi,

 

We have a number of Windows users who want to use our rabbitmq
messaging. However we need to ensure that we authenticate them without
them having to enter their Windows passwords and syncing with the
rabbitmq user passwords.

 

Has anyone looked at a mechanism for using SSPI authentication to allow
clients to connect? This is surely a common challenge, particularly in
an organisation where there are large numbers of users and the job of
providing and maintaining separate passwords for different systems is
hugs.

 

Thanks,

 

Dan Wise
