<PRE>The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 2.4.1.

This release fixes a number of bugs, in particular one bug in 2.4.0 that
would break upgrades if durable queues were present. A notable
enhancement included in this release are cluster upgrades.

See the attached release notes for more details.

Binary and source distributions of the new release can be found in the
usual place at <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html</A>

We recommend that all users of earlier versions of RabbitMQ upgrade to
this latest release.

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion
list at rabbitmq-discuss at lists.rabbitmq.com, or directly at
info at rabbitmq.com.

Regards,
          The RabbitMQ Team

Upgrading
=========
To upgrade a non-clustered RabbitMQ from release 2.1.1 or later, simply
install the new version. All configuration and persistent message data
is retained.

To upgrade a clustered RabbitMQ from release 2.1.1 or later, install
the new version on all the nodes and follow these instructions:
    <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#upgrading">http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#upgrading</A>
All configuration and persistent message data is retained.

To upgrade a non-clustered RabbitMQ from release 2.1.0, first upgrade
to 2.1.1 (which retains all data), and then to the current version as
described above.

To upgrade a clustered RabbitMQ prior to 2.1.1 or a stand-alone broker
from releases prior to 2.1.0, if the RabbitMQ installation does not
contain any important data then simply install the new
version. RabbitMQ will move the existing data to a backup location
before creating a fresh, empty database. A warning is recorded in the
logs. If your RabbitMQ installation contains important data then we
recommend you contact <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">support at rabbitmq.com</A> for assistance with the
upgrade.
