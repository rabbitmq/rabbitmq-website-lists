Yes, deleting queues with many bindings is currently slow, since the 
queue and the bindings are deleted in a single Mnesia transaction, and 
Mnesia does not seem to like transactions to get too big.

That's odd - I just tested this with rabbitmqctl list_bindings and I 
don't see it block while that's happening. And it shouldn't.

&gt;<i> Will this process block anything other

Apart from this slow deleting thing, no. You can sort of work round it 
by deleting bindings first, that's much faster. But not if it's an 
autodelete queue :(

Cheers, Simon
