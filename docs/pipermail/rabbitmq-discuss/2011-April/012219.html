</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Monads are a useful and powerful control-flow mechanism in any language.
</I>&gt;<i> However, for them to be easily used, the language tends to need to
</I>&gt;<i> directly support them in syntax, or have a very flexible and extensible
</I>&gt;<i> syntax.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In Erlang, let's say we have the three lines of code:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    A = foo(),
</I>&gt;<i>    B = bar(A, dog),
</I>&gt;<i>    ok.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They are three, straight forward statements, which are evaluated
</I>&gt;<i> consecutively. What a Monad gives you is control over what happens
</I>&gt;<i> before the first statement, between the statements, and after the last
</I>&gt;<i> statment. It is this control that makes them so powerful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now of course, there's absolutely nothing profound going on here: you
</I>&gt;<i> could just implement as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    begin(),
</I>&gt;<i>    A = foo(),
</I>&gt;<i>    middle(),
</I>&gt;<i>    B = bar(A, dog),
</I>&gt;<i>    middle(),
</I>&gt;<i>    ok,
</I>&gt;<i>    end().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But that's not quite powerful enough, because it would be nice if
</I>&gt;<i> instead the extra funs had some understanding that A and B have been
</I>&gt;<i> bound to, and that they knew what was coming next. So instead, we could
</I>&gt;<i> introduce a sort of chaining function called 'andthen':
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    andthen(foo(),
</I>&gt;<i>            fun (A) -&gt; andthen(bar(A, dog),
</I>&gt;<i>                               fun (B) -&gt; ok end)).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thus the function 'andthen' takes all results from the previous
</I>&gt;<i> expression, and controls how and whether they are passed to the next
</I>&gt;<i> expression.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As defined, the 'andthen' function is the monadic function '&gt;&gt;='.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now it's very very difficult to read the program with the 'andthen'
</I>&gt;<i> function (especially as Erlang is so annoying and doesn't allow us to
</I>&gt;<i> define new infix functions), which is why some special syntax is
</I>&gt;<i> necessary. Haskell has it's 'do' notation, and so I've borrowed from
</I>&gt;<i> that and abused Erlang's list comprehensions. Haskell also has lovely
</I>&gt;<i> type-classes, which I've sort of faked. So, with erlando, you can write
</I>&gt;<i> in Erlang:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    do([Monad ||
</I>&gt;<i>        A &lt;- foo(),
</I>&gt;<i>        B &lt;- bar(A, dog),
</I>&gt;<i>        ok]).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> which is readable and straightforward, but is transformed into:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    Monad:'&gt;&gt;='(foo(),
</I>&gt;<i>                fun (A) -&gt; Monad:'&gt;&gt;='(bar(A, dog),
</I>&gt;<i>                                       fun (B) -&gt; ok end))
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no intention that this latter form is any more readable than
</I>&gt;<i> the 'andthen' form - it is not. However, it should be clear that the
</I>&gt;<i> function Monad:'&gt;&gt;='/2 now has complete control over what happens: does
</I>&gt;<i> the fun on the RHS ever get invoked? If so, with what value?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A few years ago, I was working entirely in Haskell and I watched new
</I>&gt;<i> people pick up the language and it became something of a rite of passage
</I>&gt;<i> that everyone wrote their own (awful) tutorial on monads. I never did
</I>&gt;<i> that, and I think that looking at them from a different language helps
</I>&gt;<i> see them in a different light: it's simply a control structure that
</I>&gt;<i> allows you to inject all sorts of other functionality between and around
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;normal&quot; looking lines of code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of the things it can help with, as Alvaro pointed out, is dealing
</I>&gt;<i> with endless nested 'case' statements, especially when dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> errors. Somthing like a maybe or error monad can completely get rid of
</I>&gt;<i> the nesting, because it is the maybe:'&gt;&gt;='/2 function that detects
</I>&gt;<i> whether or not the lhs errored, and if it did error, the rhs is never
</I>&gt;<i> invoked.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See <A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/erlando/file/a1c8f1c874c6/test/src/maybe.erl">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/erlando/file/a1c8f1c874c6/test/src/maybe.erl</A>
</I>&gt;<i> or <A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/erlando/file/a1c8f1c874c6/test/src/error.erl">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/erlando/file/a1c8f1c874c6/test/src/error.erl</A> -
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully it should seem completely trivial at this point how this
</I>&gt;<i> works.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing is that we have quite a lot of test code that does
</I>&gt;<i> things like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   test(S0) -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     S1 = foo:a(S0),
</I>&gt;<i>     S2 = foo:b(S1),
</I>&gt;<i>     ...
</I>&gt;<i>     S40 = foo:aw(S39),
</I>&gt;<i>     ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is _horrible_ code because whenever you change it, you have to
</I>&gt;<i> rename a billion variables, which is surprisingly error prone and makes
</I>&gt;<i> the diff much larger. The State monad can be used to completely hide the
</I>&gt;<i> state that's being passed around here. I don't really want to try and
</I>&gt;<i> explain how the State monad works (ultimately, rather than evaluating
</I>&gt;<i> the rhs, the '&gt;&gt;=' function returns a new function which simply
</I>&gt;<i> maybe-modifies the state), but to give you a small example, compare:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server/file/default/src/rabbit_tests.erl#l2293">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server/file/default/src/rabbit_tests.erl#l2293</A>
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server/file/e227a13c93a4/src/rabbit_tests.erl#l2296">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server/file/e227a13c93a4/src/rabbit_tests.erl#l2296</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They are the same test. The latter has been rewritten to use the State
</I>&gt;<i> monad (and it also uses 'cuts' which are a form of partial application
</I>&gt;<i> which I also implemented in erlando today). Now the 2nd version is a
</I>&gt;<i> fraction longer - it has to do some work to set up the monad and it also
</I>&gt;<i> suffers from going over the 80-column limit and so having to wrap lines,
</I>&gt;<i> but which looks more maintainable to you, and which is actually simpler
</I>&gt;<i> to read and to modify?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that sheds a little light on it all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The parse transformers, some monad implementations, and some tests for
</I>&gt;<i> this stuff are all available at <A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/erlando/">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/erlando/</A>
