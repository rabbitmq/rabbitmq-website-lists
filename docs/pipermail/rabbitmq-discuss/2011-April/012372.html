<PRE>Hi,

You might want to take a look at the API on top of Rabbit (or even QPid) that is part of the Spring.NET AMQP project.

<A HREF="http://static.springsource.org/spring-amqp-net/docs/1.0.x/reference/html/amqp.html#d4e159">http://static.springsource.org/spring-amqp-net/docs/1.0.x/reference/html/amqp.html#d4e159</A>

void ConvertAndSend(string routingKey, object message);

is along the lines of what you are looking for I think.

Mark

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] Using .NET types as routing keys

Hi, I'm new to Rabbit MQ. I want to build a simple .NET API with methods like Publish&lt;T&gt;(T message). It strikes me that using the .NET type as the routing key would be a very elegant way routing messages. Has anyone used RabbitMQ like this? Is it a stupid idea?

Thanks
Mike
