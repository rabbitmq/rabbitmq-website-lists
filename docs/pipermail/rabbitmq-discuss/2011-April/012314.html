It should allow non-admins to GET /api/connections - however, they 
should only be able to learn about their *own* connections, not anybody 
else's.

You should get a 403 for /api/nodes.

</I>
The reason is that non-admin users are not supposed to be able to spy on 
other users. This should be fairly obvious for /api/connections, and for 
/api/nodes the concern is that non-admin users could infer what other 
users are doing by watching things like the number of sockets used.

That said, your requirement seems reasonable. We probably need more than 
a boolean to control this sort of thing. We have a bug open for this but 
it's not receiving attention at the moment.

In the mean time, if you're comfortable building from source the 
attached patch will allow non-admins access to nodes and the connection 
and channel lists. Since it was a 5 min hack, note that it won't allow 
access to connection details (since you can DELETE i.e. close those...)

Cheers, Simon
