These are tests for my Delphi / Free Pascal client library, which are 
now close to the first release

&gt;<i> I can take a quick guess at why this is failing. The SUBSCRIBE frames

</I>&gt;<i> by a few SENDs then you might not see MESSAGE frames for the SUBSCRIBEs
</I>&gt;<i> that are yet to finish processing.
</I>
This was my first thought too - so I inserted a long delay (several 
seconds) between the subscribe and the send. It did not solve the 
problem, the broker did not send all incoming messages to all 
subscribers. I could not find any pattern, so I was happy to see your 
answer and tried it today

&gt;<i> The best way to guarantee that a SUBSCRIBE has finished is to provide a
</I>&gt;<i> receipt: header and then wait for the receipt. You'll see this pattern
</I>&gt;<i> quite a lot in the RabbitMQ STOMP tests.
</I>
Adding a receipt header fixed the problem. However, this is not 
specified in the Stomp documentation (the receipt header is optional). 
(Maybe the requirement of using a receipt header should be added to the 
RabbitMQ Stomp adapter docs.)

Thanks and have a nice day
