<PRE>Hi &#216;yvind,

&gt;<i> I'm using version 2.2.0 (Erlang 14B on windows) with a shovel between two rabbit servers. When the shovel plugin looses it connection to the remote rabbit server (tested by stopping the rabbit service at the other end) the number of used Erlang processes seems to grow steadily each time the shovel tries to reconnect.

</I>&gt;<i> .. Just downloaded v 2.4.0 and without doing too much testing, this version seems to behave properly. When the shovel tries to reconnect, the Erlang process count rises by 30, but drops back by 30 before a new reconnect attempt is performed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am I right in thinking there was a bug in 2.2.0 that has been fixed, or do I need to do further testing? :) Just did a 2-minute experiment...

You are correct - the bug was reported to us a while ago and has since
been fixed. I think it might have been fixed in 2.3.0/2.3.1 too, but
it's certainly fixed in 2.4.0.
