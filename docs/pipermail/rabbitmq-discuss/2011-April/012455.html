No.  And I don't think you want to do that either ;) - there's no
guarantee that the last message sent out by a queue is the last message
to arrive at a client: especially in light of things like basic.qos but
even if that were set to 1 and you're manually acking, slow network
links etc may mean some other client that was sent the penultimate msg
in the queue actually receives that message a long time after the real
last msg in the queue gets received and processed by some other client.
That said, you may not care about these cases...

Could you describe why you're trying to achieve this and/or what problem
you're trying to solve?

Best wishes,

Matthew
