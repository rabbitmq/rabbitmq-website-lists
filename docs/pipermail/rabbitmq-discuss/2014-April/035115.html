Seems like the issue is in SimpleAmqpClient's
ChannelImpl::MaybeReleaseBufferOnChannel() method, it fails to call
amqp_maybe_release_buffers_on_channel() because by the time it is called, it
can't find channel in m_open_channels(bug?).

Try this --

In File SimpleAmqpClient/src/ChannelImpl.cpp,
call amqp_maybe_release_buffers_on_channel() in ReturnChannel().

void ChannelImpl::ReturnChannel(amqp_chanel_t channel)
{
   +amqp_maybe_release_buffers_on_channel(m_connection, channel);
    m_free_channels.push(channel);
}
