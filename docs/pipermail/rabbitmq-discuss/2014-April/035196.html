That's perhaps why we see this &quot;disconnecting&quot; business then, since PHP doesn't support long-lived connections. Not sure what you can do about that, given the way PHP works. Perhaps someone with more PHP expertise can comment?

As Michael points out though, it's really not an issue when working with request/reply queues, since the connection does not have to be long-lived in order for this to work. 

Cheers,
Tim
