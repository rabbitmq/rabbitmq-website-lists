<PRE>We are using nginx as a proxy. I don't believe it supports the nocanon option that is mentioned in your sample apache proxy config. I will investigate this further.

Nothing in this region should have changed between 3.2.2 and 3.3.0, nor should it be related to the Erlang version used.

If you're seeing this bug on your machine but not others then I wonder if you are going via some broken proxy? We have definitely seen proxies break URL escaping before now.
