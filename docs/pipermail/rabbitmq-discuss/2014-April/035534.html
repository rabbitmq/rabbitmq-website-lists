Subject: Re: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ.Client.Exceptions.AuthenticationFailureException / ACCESS_REFUSED

Not so quick update.  Tried looking at broker log file on server but couldn't find it in default locations specified by documentation.  Ended up setting a custom WINDOWS environment variable RABBITMQ_LOG_BASE to a custom folder I created.  Had to uninstall rabbitmq service / reinstall rabbit mq service to get it to finally use my custom log folder.  Once that happened I was able to glean the following useful info from the log file:

=ERROR REPORT==== 25-Apr-2014::23:19:49 ===
closing AMQP connection &lt;0.278.0&gt; (172.17.9.14:61333 -&gt; 172.17.9.24:5672):
{handshake_error,starting,0,
                 {amqp_error,access_refused,
                             &quot;PLAIN login refused: user 'guest' can only connect via localhost&quot;,
                             'connection.start_ok'}}

So apparently RabbitMQ no longer allows guest login outside of localhost.  Our previous version of RabbitMQ did allow this.  Apparently this was a breaking change some where along the way.
