<PRE>Hi Matthias,

I will check the logs again for errors.

Ok, I think I have worked out what is occurring here.... someone has some code running somewhere that is recreating this queue each time I delete it. Many apologies for not spotting this sooner.

We are still seeing the below when we try to view a queue with a + in the management plugin.

Not found

The object you clicked on was not found; it may have been deleted on the server.

I guess this is related to us being on 3.2.2 as it doesn't appear to be an issue on 3.2.3. I have just tried on <A HREF="http://dev.rabbitmq.com/mgmt/">http://dev.rabbitmq.com/mgmt/</A> which allowed me to create the queue and then view it in the management plugin. I also noticed the version of erlang you're using in <A HREF="http://dev.rabbitmq.com/mgmt/">http://dev.rabbitmq.com/mgmt/</A> is only 14A. We are using 16B03. But I guess this is probably not related?

Cheers

Chris

No, it's not. Have just tried that on <A HREF="http://dev.rabbitmq.com/mgmt/,">http://dev.rabbitmq.com/mgmt/,</A> which is running 3.2.3.

As Simon said, the problem has likely nothing to do with the queue name, so please check the server logs for any errors.
