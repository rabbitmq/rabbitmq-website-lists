<PRE>It would be great if you could bring it back.

We need a two-way federation but have both federation clients in one broker
only. Therefore we have a (custom) federation plug-in (running in the
upstream broker) that re-publishes data to a downstream exchange. The
downstream broker validates the User-IDs, but it doesn't know this was a
federation, so to make this work we have either to:
 - modify the &quot;user_id&quot; in the upstream before re-publishing down-- but then
we lose the information about the actual publisher and all upstream users
will be represented by the broker username, or
 - assign the &quot;impersonator&quot; tag to the username used by upstream when
connecting to downstream, so it can re-publish data down on behalf of
others.

In other words, the &quot;escaped&quot; implementation detail was used to implement
user_id validation in upstream-controlled federations. Does it make sense?

It was really an internal implementation detail of the federation plugin
that &quot;escaped&quot;.

We removed it because we had no idea people would find it useful.

Can I ask what you were doing with it? It would not be impossible to bring
it back, but I am genuinely curious as to why anyone would need it.

Cheers, Simon
