I&#8217;d recommend doing your own benchmarks instead of believing numbers
posted on the Internet.

&gt;<i> 2. Publishing rate depends on how many queues have a binding for

</I>&gt;<i> (com.foo.bar.xxx.zzz). The messages start to differ from the  
</I>&gt;<i> xxx part. Does the structure of the routing key influences publishing  
</I>&gt;<i> speed? What would be the impact of drastically increasing the  
</I>&gt;<i> number of queues (and bindings)? I am thinking of having thousand  
</I>&gt;<i> queues.
</I>
Topic routing uses a trie internally which doesn&#8217;t get much slower
as the number of bindings increases or topic length grows. However,
since every queue gets a copy of the message, there will be some impact,
in particular with larger messages.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Is it wise to run everything over the same exchange? As far as  
</I>&gt;<i> I read on the mailing list, different exchanges on the same cluster  
</I>&gt;<i> do not influence each other - as long as there are enough physical  
</I>&gt;<i> resources.
</I>
Exchanges are just named routing tables. Using a single exchange vs multiple
exchanges of the same type should make no difference.

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 4. How do we know, that we hit some limit of rabbitmq by using it  
</I>&gt;<i> the wrong way? Is there any way to see and monitor internal rabbitmq  
</I>&gt;<i> metrics? What&#8217;s your favorite tool to monitor RabbitMQ?
</I>
RabbitMQ management UI and HTTP API that ships with it.

&gt;<i> 5. What do you think about having a Channel per Queue? That decision  
</I>&gt;<i> made us able to set the prefetch size and thread count per queue  
</I>&gt;<i> on the client side.
</I>
Every channel consumes a bit of RAM but it should work fine.&#160;
