<PRE>It's going to be hard to debug this without seeing your code, especially 
since it sounds like it is quite likely to be a general Erlang problem.

Having said that, here are some general pointers:

Have you seen amqp_channel:wait_for_confirms/1? That might be easier 
than handling the confirms yourself if all you are going to do is wait 
for them anyway.

It's very hard to see what is going wrong here in detail, but the 
surface issue is that your gen_server took more than 5 seconds to 
respond to a request - note that gen_server:call/2 will time out after 5 
seconds.

For this reason we never use gen_server:call/2 (we have a CI task that 
explodes if we accidentally commit code using it!); we always use call/3 
with a timeout of 'infinity'. IMO this is a misfeature in Erlang.

&gt;<i> My take-away, although likely I am wrong, is that somewhere, apparently
</I>&gt;<i> in amqp_balanced_publisher, a gen_server call is timing-out while
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for a response. But, I seem to be able to trace the responses
</I>&gt;<i> through the whole stack so I am thoroughly confused.
</I>
That's correct. Of course, it should be quite rare / require heavy load 
for the 5s timeout to fail because the operation simply took too long. 
It's quite possible that the gen_server you are calling into is 
deadlocked or stuck in some other way.

I would debug this as follows:

1) Change the call/2 to call/3 with infinity.
2) If the program now hangs rather than times out, launch 'observer' 
(<A HREF="http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/observer/observer_ug.html">http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/observer/observer_ug.html</A>), go and find 
the server you are calling into, and see what it's current stacktrace 
is. You may wish to give this process a registered name temporarily so 
you can find it more easily.

Cheers, Simon
