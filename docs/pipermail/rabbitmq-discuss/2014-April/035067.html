It's possible I misunderstood you. I thought you were waiting for the 
confirm - i.e. you were effectively reimplementing wait_for_confirms() 
anyway. Yes, it is slower to call wait_for_confirms() (especially if you 
call it frequently) as you will stop publishing.

&gt;<i> Speaking of misunderstandings; the second reason I did not use
</I>&gt;<i> wait_for_confirms was that I didn't completely understand the definition:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Wait until all messages published since the last call have been either
</I>&gt;<i> ack'd or nack'd by the broker; or until timeout elapses.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What exactly does it mean by the &quot;last call&quot;?
</I>
The last call to wait_for_confirms().

&gt;<i> This sounded to me as if
</I>&gt;<i> it may get in a situation that if calls are coming-in rapidly enough
</I>&gt;<i> that they are publishing new messages prior to the previous message
</I>&gt;<i> getting ack'd, it would not respond until all such queued messages were
</I>&gt;<i> ack'd/nack'd.
</I>
Yes, that's correct.

Cheers, Simon
