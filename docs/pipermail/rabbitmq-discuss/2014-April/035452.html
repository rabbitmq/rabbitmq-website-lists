<PRE>Ignore the below email, as it turned out the set up is not correct. On a similar note, can you please let me know if high availability set up is possible at a cluster level?

If I have Rs1 and Rs2 rabbit servers in cluster1 and Rs3 and Rs4 servers in cluster 2, how can I configure Rs1 and Rs2 to load balance the requests and have cluster1 set up in high availability with cluster2?

Subject: [rabbitmq-discuss] RabbitMQ HA set up not working as expected

I have a question regarding the High Availability set up for RabbitMq servers. I have 2 RabbitMq servers set up to be in HA mode, and the queues in one server is automatically replicated on the other server. But when I bring one of those servers down, if I stop the server on which I primarily created the queue, then I can no longer access that queue even on server-2. And once I restart the first server, the queue is safely retained. Is this the intended behavior?

How can I configure the servers/queues so that even if one of the RabbitMQ servers is down, the other should be able to handle the requests seemlessly.

Thanks,
Anita
