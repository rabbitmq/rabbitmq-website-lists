<PRE>You rock Simon! So much great information. I found my problem and it was
indeed a gen_server timeout due to a missed return in my confirmation chain
going back up the chain to the rest interface where I respond to the client
that posted the message for publishing.

However, that said, I am curious about the option of just using
amqp_channel:wait_for_confirms/1. I did not use this option for a couple of
reasons.

First was the fact that using the registered handler is mentioned quite
often as the preferred option. My understanding was that using the
amqp_channel:wait_for_confirms would cause the channel to wait for a
response before another message could be published on that channel. If this
is true, it seems like it could slow-down publishing more than registering
a handler and letting publishing continue. Is this correct? Or am I
misunderstanding the whole workflow?

Speaking of misunderstandings; the second reason I did not use
wait_for_confirms was that I didn't completely understand the definition:

&quot;Wait until all messages published since the last call have been either
ack'd or nack'd by the broker; or until timeout elapses.&quot;

What exactly does it mean by the &quot;last call&quot;? This sounded to me as if it
may get in a situation that if calls are coming-in rapidly enough that they
are publishing new messages prior to the previous message getting ack'd, it
would not respond until all such queued messages were ack'd/nack'd. I
realized this was unlikely, but could not come-up with documentation clear
enough to convince me otherwise and this would not work for me as I need to
respond to each publish individually.

Thanks again for the, characteristically, excellent and comprehensive
reponse.

Best,

Ryan

</I>&gt;<i> It's very hard to see what is going wrong here in detail, but the surface

</I>&gt;<i> For this reason we never use gen_server:call/2 (we have a CI task that

</I>&gt;<i> with a timeout of 'infinity'. IMO this is a misfeature in Erlang.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  My take-away, although likely I am wrong, is that somewhere, apparently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in amqp_balanced_publisher, a gen_server call is timing-out while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> waiting for a response. But, I seem to be able to trace the responses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through the whole stack so I am thoroughly confused.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's correct. Of course, it should be quite rare / require heavy load
</I>&gt;<i> for the 5s timeout to fail because the operation simply took too long. It's
</I>&gt;<i> quite possible that the gen_server you are calling into is deadlocked or
</I>&gt;<i> stuck in some other way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would debug this as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Change the call/2 to call/3 with infinity.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) If the program now hangs rather than times out, launch 'observer' (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/observer/observer_ug.html">http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/observer/observer_ug.html</A>), go and find
</I>&gt;<i> the server you are calling into, and see what it's current stacktrace is.
</I>&gt;<i> You may wish to give this process a registered name temporarily so you can
