<PRE>Hi All,

A little back ground. We're using highly available queues in a two node cluster running on Ubuntu 12.04LTS and RAbbitMQ server 3.2.2. The ha policy is set to automatically mirror each queue to the other node for failover. Our application code handles the failover and is aware of both rabbit servers.

I am having trouble deleting a queue in a vhost. The queue name contains some special chars which may be causing the management plugin some troubles when displaying the queue information. When I click on the queue name in the management plugin I get the following error message:

Not found
The object you clicked on was not found; it may have been deleted on the server.


Queue name is: Applications_Pasngr_Events_Contract_Messages+DataSourceChange:Applications_Pasngr_Events_Contract&lt;<A HREF="https://dev.zorrillo.net/monitoring/rabbitmq/#/queues/zorrillo.applications.pasngr/Zorrillo_Applications_Pasngr_Events_Contract_Messages%2BDataSourceChange%3AZorrillo_Applications_Pasngr_Events_Contract">https://dev.zorrillo.net/monitoring/rabbitmq/#/queues/zorrillo.applications.pasngr/Zorrillo_Applications_Pasngr_Events_Contract_Messages%2BDataSourceChange%3AZorrillo_Applications_Pasngr_Events_Contract</A>&gt;

I suspect it is the + that is the problem. If someone can help me delete it I promise not to make another queue with a + in.... Which was probably a silly idea in the first place...

I have tried rabbitmqctl but that doesn't have any delete queues options. I have also tried rabbitmqadmin python script (from <A HREF="http://brokerurl:15672/cli">http://brokerurl:15672/cli</A>) with the command line (both with and without the quotes):

python rabbitmqadmin -V applications.pasngr delete queue name=&quot;Applications_Pasngr_Events_Contract_Messages+DataSourceChange: Applications_Pasngr_Events_Contract&quot;

The command line returns saying that the queue has been deleted but looking at the management plugin it appears to be only deleted from one node. (management plugin shows a red +1 indicating it's not mirrored). The HA policy appears to immediately recreate the deleted queue from the other node. I have tried deleting the queue from both nodes in the same way but I can't seem to do it synchronously enough to make it actually disappear.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers
