Well, that's where discussion is *resting* at the moment :-) I am
personally of the opinion that the threads *should* be set daemon, on
the theory that not closing an AMQP connection before exiting is like
not flushing a buffer wrapping a socket stream before exiting. Both
result in (potentially) losing data; neither is automatically taken care
of for you by the infrastructure. In the case of sockets, the VM is
happy to exit and force the socket shut without flushing buffers; I
think AMQP should behave in the same way.

&gt;<i> The connection should always be explicitly closed.
</I>
I agree with this (just like I'd agree with &quot;you should always flush
your buffers before exiting&quot;), since it's the only way to be sure that
traffic you intended to send actually got sent.

&gt;<i> The alternative is that you
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes see messages disappear without trace which is far worse, and
</I>&gt;<i> much harder to debug.
</I>
Well that's true. Perhaps the non-auto-buffer-flushing behaviour around
sockets is simply (yet another instance of) premature optimisation from
the Java library designers?
