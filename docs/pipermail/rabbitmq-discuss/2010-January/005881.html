We're using it at Stax Networks (www.stax.net).

In addition to the testimonials here, you might also use AMQP as a
selling point. The background of AMQP is very enterprise architecture
friendly. I can testify to the value of the open spec, having moved
from qpid server to rabbitmq without changing client code. Once you
get buy in on AMQP, rabbitmq is on the short list of grade A servers
(qpid is definitely in the same class, IMO). For risk averse decision
makers, this might resonate.

The Erlang story behind rabbitmq, I think, is another compelling
point. As a quick exercise, if you haven't already, look over the
amount of source code for the rabbitmq server. If your impression is
anything like mine, you'll be surprised at how little code there is.
This is pretty anecdotal, but it's one of the more persuasive points
for me - rabbitmq really leverages the goodness of Erlang and that's
an outstanding match for long running, highly concurrent systems.
