The &quot;short node&quot; changes in the last release relate to Erlang's 
inter-node communication. They do not affect ordinary network 
operations, so that's not the source of the problem.

The config file location is %APPDATA%\RabbitMQ\rabbitmq.config. See 
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html#configfile,">http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html#configfile,</A> which also documents 
how to change its location.

</I>
rabbitmq-c is highly experimental - so experimental in fact that it's 
not even mentioned in our &quot;Experimental Downloads&quot; section on the web 
site. We have not spent any effort on trying to make it build on 
Windows. So I am not surprised it took a while to get working.

We welcome patches, and feedback in general. If you have managed to 
build rabbitmq-c on Windows, could you perhaps post the instructions?


Regards,

Matthias.
