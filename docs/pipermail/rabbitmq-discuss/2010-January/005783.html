I thought that the :nowait argument in the 0-8, 0-9 and 0-9-1 specs  
was what provides the ability to use synchronous methods in an  
asynchronous fashion. When I use the terms synchronous and  
asynchronous here I'm using them in the manner that the AMQP specs  
seem to use them; namely synchronous methods send a response to tell  
you whether they've succeeded and asynchronous ones don't. If :nowait  
is set to true doesn't that mean that the server will not send an -ok  
response?

Regards,

Chris
