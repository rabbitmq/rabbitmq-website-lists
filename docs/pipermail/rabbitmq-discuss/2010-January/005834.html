Queue creation is quite expensive; creating a temporary queue for every 
single request is therefore quite costly and you may well not be able to 
get 3000Hz throughput that way.

Are you planning to create a connection per request too? That too would 
be costly.

I'd recommend using a pool of connections, with per-connection exclusive 
reply queues.

&gt;<i> now, if the webserver thread breaks out of the wait before the message

</I>&gt;<i> the response from the backend server is sent to the exchange where it 
</I>&gt;<i> dies. (which is fine)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> if the webserver thread breaks out of the wait after the message 
</I>&gt;<i> returns, the queue gets deleted anyway and the message should vanish.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the webserver thread dies for some reason, the queue gets auto 
</I>&gt;<i> deleted and so the  backend server again sends the response to the 
</I>&gt;<i> exchange to a non existent queue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, the problem comes in when the webserver thread dies just as the 
</I>&gt;<i> response returns on the temporary queue. When this race condition 
</I>&gt;<i> occurs, the queue should remain on the rabbitmq-server forever. Is this 
</I>&gt;<i> right, or is there something I'm missing?
</I>
Exclusive queues get deleted when their creating connection disappears. 
So the answer to the above depends on how you manage the lifecycle of 
the AMQP connection.

Matthias.
