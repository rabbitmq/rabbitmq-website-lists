The need for some confirmation of publish is much wider than 
exactly-once delivery. That confirmation mechanism should also support 
asynchronous use if desired to avoid the performance impact Scott points 
out[*].

The 0-10 protocol doesn't really provide nacks per se. It has a 
message-release command which is useful when subscribers want to use 
prefetch and need to relinquish some of the messages delivered to them 
without killing the session.

[*] Perhaps of interest to mention that there was some disagreement 
within the amqp wg on whether -ok response to methods identified as 
synchronous by the 0-8 spec could be used asynchronously i.e. whether it 
was valid to send methods without waiting for the -ok and process 
receipt of those -ok response as they arrive in the other direction. 
Most (all?) of them aren't explicitly correlated, so were you to do that 
you would need to rely on the order of -oks matching the order of 
methods which if I recall correctly was the cause for concern at the time.
