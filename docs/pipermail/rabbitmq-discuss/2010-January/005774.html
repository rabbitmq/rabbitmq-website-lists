<PRE>Hi Vishnu,

Correct.

&gt;<i>     However, if I choose not to autoack, then it looks like the

</I>&gt;<i> (the use case we have requires us to make sure that every message is

Rabbit does eventual delivery. Thus eventually, the message will be
delivered. However, it may be delivered to more than one consumer. A
message that is not ack'd will, when the channel on which it was
delivered closes (or the connection, or some other condition that I
always forget, but which Matthias pointed out within about the last
month on this list), be reinserted into its queue to be redelivered.

Thus if you set qos.prefetch to 1, don't auto-ack, and then your client
goes down, you have the following set of properties:
1) Your client will only receive the next message when it's successfully
ack'd the current message.
2) If the client crashes, at most 1 message (i.e. the message that it's
currently processing) will be requeued.
3) If you want to do timeouts, if depends where you wish to put the
timeout - kill clients if they're taking too long (this seems odd) - or
drop messages you receive (i.e. ack them but do no work) if they're
deemed too old. But yes, that's all client-side logic - we don't do TTL
in the server yet.

Matthew
