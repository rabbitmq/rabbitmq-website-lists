<PRE>It would be nice to have a lazy ack and things like that will be in
future versions of amqp.

For now, have you looked at the TX class?

&gt;<i> Before I begin let me state for the record that I have read the 0-8
</I>&gt;<i> and 0-9 AMQP specs and realise that they will not change just because
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that it might be a good idea. Neither do I advocate
</I>&gt;<i> deviation from the specs for the sake of expedience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I've been looking at including Channel.Flow method processing in
</I>&gt;<i> the Bunny client (again) and have come to the conclusion that
</I>&gt;<i> publishing should be synchronous in AMQP terms. My reasoning is as
</I>&gt;<i> follows -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The AMQP Channel.Flow method is a device to try to prevent servers
</I>&gt;<i> getting swamped by message producing clients. The server sends a
</I>&gt;<i> Channel.Flow method with :active argument set to false to a producer
</I>&gt;<i> in order to get the producer to stop sending messages when server
</I>&gt;<i> memory is getting critically low.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a client application publishes a message it passes that message
</I>&gt;<i> into the care of the server. If something goes wrong the client
</I>&gt;<i> application needs to be notified, but it is equally important for the
</I>&gt;<i> client to know that the server has the message and will do its level
</I>&gt;<i> best to deliver it to an appropriate destination queue. It seems to
</I>&gt;<i> me that the second piece of information, namely a &quot;yes I have your
</I>&gt;<i> message&quot;, is missing. This absence of information means that the
</I>&gt;<i> client has to make a judgement on the success of the publish
</I>&gt;<i> operation based on what it does not receive, rather than what is does
</I>&gt;<i> receive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If, after issuing a Basic.Publish method, a client does not receive
</I>&gt;<i> an error indication or Channel.Flow method, it has to assume that a
</I>&gt;<i> publish has succeeded. For a simple single-threaded synchronous
</I>&gt;<i> client like Bunny, the lack of a publish-ok method means that it has
</I>&gt;<i> to wait to see whether a message arrives that indicates a problem. So
</I>&gt;<i> in the case of Basic.Publish, the client could do a blocking read
</I>&gt;<i> that times out if no message is received. However, even if I could
</I>&gt;<i> rely on the timeout to work without fail (which my current testing is
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting may not be the case), I don't like that solution at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With a publish-ok method things become much more straightforward. If
</I>&gt;<i> the client receives a publish-ok then everything is rosy in the
</I>&gt;<i> garden. If not, the client handles the issue. There could be
</I>&gt;<i> a :nowait flag as there are for other methods for asynchronous
</I>&gt;<i> processing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone has any ideas as to how I can get around this issue using
</I>&gt;<i> Ruby without additional threads, fibers, eventmachine etc. I would be
</I>&gt;<i> very pleased to hear from them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
