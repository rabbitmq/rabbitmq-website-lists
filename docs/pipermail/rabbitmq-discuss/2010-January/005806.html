<PRE>Alexis -

Funny you should ask now.  I've just resumed working on an AMQP interface
after getting input from our team members and have been doing a lot of
design
work.  Our approach is to write our own code generator that writes code to
do the serialization and de-serialization.  The interface is specified as a
Java
interface, and then we will be using Java introspection to get the methods
and
parameters.  The code generator will be able to make code for any language,
but all I can see happening for the short term is Java and C++.

The transport is in XML.  We use XML a lot and are comfortable with the
technology.
Messages are self-describing and verifiable.  We are leaning towards a
slightly
&quot;heavier&quot; transport that favors abstraction over speed.  I think that if we
have
situations where we need more speed, it will be situations like &quot;we need to
get
4 GB of medical images from here to there&quot;, in which case we'll either open
up a &quot;raw&quot; AMQP channel that does no formatting, or, even faster, open up
a socket connection.

I had written an initial version of a library to interface to AMQP that I am
mostly
discarding in favor of a re-write that makes implementing servers easier and
provides
more flexibility (for example: server classes that support messages where
some must be replied
to and others that are not, direct messages, and fanout messages).

I've got chunks of code written but am still working on the lower level
design.  The
architecture is pretty much done.  Lots more coding to do.

I've thought about this (very fun) problem a lot, and have had a few
&quot;epiphanies&quot;.  There
is a lot more details I'm not mentioning because there is so much.  I would
be happy
to answer any questions or trade ideas.

PS: I don't always examine every rabbitmq-discuss message, so please feel
free
contact me directly.

Thanks,

- Jim

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We are replacing much of our SOAP infrastructure with AMQP, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one problem we are looking at is how to wrap an AMQP call so that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it has a nice programming interface.  Basically we want to serialize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an object on one side and de-serialize on the other side, and do it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a language independent way (we use Java C#, and C++).
