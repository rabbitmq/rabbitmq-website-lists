<PRE>John,

So sometimes just running 'rabbitmqctl', with no args, displays the help 
message and then hangs for 60s+ before terminating?

How easy is it to reproduce this behaviour?

&gt;<i>      &gt;&gt;&gt;As I said, not a bug per se, just annoying
</I>
It is certainly very strange behaviour, and not something we have ever 
seen before.

Btw, is the machine running Windows natively or virtualised?

Do you have a second machine on which to repeat the experiment?

ok. Do you by any chance have %RABBITMQ_CTL_ERL_ARGS% set to anything? 
Or any other %RABBITMQ_*% env vars? Your previous post 
(<A HREF="http://old.nabble.com/Re%3A-MulticastMain-Java-client-causes-Erlang-error-eheap_alloc%3A-Cannot-allocate-467078560-bytes-of-memory-%28of-type-%22heap%22%29-%28with-RabbitMQ-1.7.1%29-p27337008.html">http://old.nabble.com/Re%3A-MulticastMain-Java-client-causes-Erlang-error-eheap_alloc%3A-Cannot-allocate-467078560-bytes-of-memory-%28of-type-%22heap%22%29-%28with-RabbitMQ-1.7.1%29-p27337008.html</A>) 
indicates that at the very least you must have set %RABBITMQ_NODENAME%, 
since the status report is for a node other than 'rabbit'.

Also, do you really get a whole bunch of &quot;PROGRESS REPORT&quot; messages when 
running rabbitmqctl, as indicated by that post?


Regards,

Matthias.
