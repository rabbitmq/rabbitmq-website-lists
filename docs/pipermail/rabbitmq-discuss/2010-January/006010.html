<PRE>Hi,

Is there a way to provide my own queue name instead of the system
generated while instantiating rpcclient. As it uses private methods to
declare/setup reply queue and consumer. So if I need to overrride this I
cant.
 
Any reason why setupReplyQueue() and setupConsumer() is not protected ?

Thanks
Rajesh
