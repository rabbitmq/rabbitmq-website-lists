<PRE>Hey guys,

This is my first post to this list - im afraid im a bit of a rabbitmq
n00bie! I've got everything setup and working and now looking to do
something good with it to understand how it all works for my use case.

Essentially I have some backend tools that expose services with SOAP -
for which my app will repeatedly get data from - probably every 10
seconds, maybe less i've not decided yet. Anyway... said app gets said
data from those services. What I would then like it to do is notify
any other consumers (which will be other applications) that have opted
to subscribe to information / updates about that job via AMQP.
Consumers will also be able to hand messages to the central service
and effectively say &quot;deal with this job and notify me about any
changes&quot;.

Now then, excuse my complete ignorance, but its possible to build such
a workflow, right? Any pro's / con's in doing this? What would be the
optimal way to build such a system from a RabbitMQ POV?

Just looking for a bit of a sounding board right now so any
information / feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers, Tim
