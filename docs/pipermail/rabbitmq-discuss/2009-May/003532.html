<PRE>Hi Tony,

It could be a connection thing as it happened only in debug, but when I
checked the connections in server it was fine. So this is a strange
behaviour. Let me see if this happens in release mode.

Also, iam declaring a queue as follows,
Passive = false
Durable = false
Exclusive = true
Autodelete = true
Nowait = true

This would create a non durable and auto delete queue. I can inspect
using rabbitmqctl list_queues, but it only gives me durable and
autodelete and not the other items related to declare queue.
Also, what is exclusive used for.

So there is no way I can find out if my queue is deleted.

I my case the client creates queue just once and then waits on a
callback for any messages on that queue. So if a queue is deleted then
the client will be just sitting there waiting for a message without
knowing that the queue no longer exists.

Thanks
Rajesh

Could it be that the pauses caused by the debugger in turn caused the
heartbeat mechanism to fire, terminating the connection at the
server-side?

You can do a passive declare; though this will cause the channel to
close if the queue does not exist. Alternatively, you may not need to
check: queue.declare is idempotent, and you can simply issue the
queue.declare again if you are in doubt.
