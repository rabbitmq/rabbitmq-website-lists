<PRE>Hi Tony,

Thanks a lot for your reply.

Yes iam following the same steps as mentioned by you below. In my case I
have a call back which is waiting on this queue.
Now whenever a message arrives on the queue I get the callback called.

As I was debugging some issue the queue was deleted even though the
connection is still active and I was no longer receiving any call back(
as the queue no longer exists).

Do you see any reason why the queue was deleted and the connection still
active. 

Also, regarding the Queue inspection . I meant how do I check in my
client if the queue exists.

Thanks
Rajesh

Autodelete queues disappear once the last consumer consuming from them
is closed. (If no consumers are ever created on the queue, it won't be
deleted automatically, IIRC.) Since consumers are scoped to the lifetime
of a channel, which in turn is scoped to the lifetime of a TCP/IP
connection, then if you

 - connect
 - open a channel
 - create your autodelete queue
 - basic.consume from it
 - handle deliveries for a while
 - drop the connection, either cleanly or as the result of an error

then the queue will end up deleted.

Regarding inspection of the queue, what kinds of things are you
interested in? You might try &quot;rabbitmqctl list_queues&quot;, and see if any
of the available info items meet your needs.

Regards,
  Tony
