Having only one disc node in a cluster deprives you of the nicest characteristic
of a cluster: you can be sure that if one database state gets corrupted for some
reason, you still have the other one. This is even more relevant when using HA
queues, which is what you want to do.

Having only a RAM node online is a situation that you should avoid - losing data
is really easy in that position.

&gt; If just 1, but its disk fails, does the other one automatically become a &quot;disk
&gt; node&quot;?

No.

&gt; If not, and I replace the failed-disk machine with a brand new machine with
&gt; the same name (e.g. rabbit@server1) and simply instruct it to join the cluster
&gt; - will everything continue to work as if nothing happened?

Yes, that should work.

&gt; If I can't, then 2 disk nodes is the better solution, yes? And if I did that,
&gt; is recovering from an abrupt failure of 1 of the machines simply to replace
&gt; that machine, give it the same name (e.g. rabbit@server1) and call the
&gt; rabbitmqctl cluster command? Is that all I would have to do?

Again, that should be OK.

&gt; I also have a 3rd machine running, which doesn't have any local web app
&gt; software which creates or listens for any RabbitMQ messages. Would I benefit
&gt; from using that as an additional (3rd) RabbitMQ node still? For example, the
&gt; 3rd non-web-app machine as a disk node, and the 2 web-app-clustered (which
&gt; load-balance) machines as RAM nodes? And maybe have a RAID disk in the 3rd
&gt; non-web-app machine. Is this the best solution of all? Last question, how do I
&gt; recover after explicitly removing a disk node (i.e. not through disk failure,
&gt; this in addition do the disk-failure question)?

See my reply at the top of this message. In general you'd want to measure if RAM
nodes give you a real benefit and consider them once you established that. RAM
nodes do (durable) resource creation/deletion faster, so if you are using those
operation intensively you might get something out of RAM nodes. Everything else
is not affected - persistent queue still persist, and transient operations are
transient on disc nodes too.
