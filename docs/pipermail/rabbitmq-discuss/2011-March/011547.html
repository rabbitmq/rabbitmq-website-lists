You may be right for the time being. Which is a pity as yours is exactly 
the problem the new federation plugin is intended to solve, but it's not 
ready yet.

There's some documentation at:

<A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-federation/file/default/README">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-federation/file/default/README</A>

If it sounds interesting then you might want to play with it, although I 
warn you that it's still under heavy development. But if you can live 
with a temporary solution for a while I intend for it to be more 
generally useful soon.

Cheers, Simon
