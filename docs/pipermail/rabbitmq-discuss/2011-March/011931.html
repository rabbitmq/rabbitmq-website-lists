Gah, clearly, if it's limiting you to 1.6GB then it's already doing the
right thing - it's detecting the 4GB limit already. The crash/malloc
fail is not the right thing however.

Over lunch we did manage to come up with a hypothesis as to what's going
wrong, and a quick subsequent test showed this to be accurate. I've now
fixed the bug and whilst it's pending QA, I'd be interested in whether
it fixes your crash even under a 32-bit Erlang VM. If you have the time
and are comfortable compiling Rabbit from scratch, try the branch called
&quot;bug23968&quot; and repeat you're test. It should not crash, even under a
32-bit VM, and it should use substantially less memory too.
