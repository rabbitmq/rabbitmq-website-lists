Yes. And addressed in 2.4.0. See
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#consumer-cancel-notify">http://www.rabbitmq.com/extensions.html#consumer-cancel-notify</A>

&gt;<i> To further test, I changed the queue to a durable one and replayed the
</I>&gt;<i> previous events. Except this time since the consumer was still fat dumb and
</I>&gt;<i> happy, I restarted the rabbit node. Then I published again. Still nothing on
</I>&gt;<i> the consumer and the queue (which had returned) had a queue count of 0.
</I>&gt;<i> Doing a list_bindings showed the binding to still exist. But no amount of

</I>&gt;<i> thing that allowed the queue to receive messages again (and the consumer to

</I>&gt;<i> the binding was reported as still existing.
</I>
Actually, if you did a basic.cancel and then a basic.consume then you
should find you can start consuming from the queue again. That is the
expected strategy in light of the above notification extension.
