This is quite interesting, because I've been having somewhat similar 
thoughts about extending the management UI. rabbitmq-shovel already 
holds some status information that it would be useful to see, and the 
upcoming rabbitmq-federation probably will too. Other plugins might have 
similar needs.

I think my case is a superset of yours though; I need to be able to 
extend the HTTP API (probably by plugging modules into the webmachine 
dispatch table) as well as plugging into the Javascript.

Of course, I haven't actually *done* anything yet.

</I>
Hmm, I suspect that may be the best approach in the short term.

&gt;<i> If we create such a patch, would it be considered for inclusion so we
</I>&gt;<i> don't have to maintain our own version of the plugin?
</I>
Probably not, as it's likely to get trampled by what I'm planning to do 
I'm afraid.

Cheers, Simon
