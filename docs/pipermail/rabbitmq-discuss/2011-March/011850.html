<PRE>Hi Steven,

That would be similar to supplying null properties. So far there has 
been insufficient demand for an overloaded publish method, because it is 
simple enough to supply null properties.

&gt;<i> No reset required for the enumerator.
</I>
I agree that it makes no sense to reset a subscription, but the 
enumerator is useless after MoveNext returns false without a Reset(), 
according to the IEnumerator documentation.

&gt;<i> The context is: A. send off a bunch of messages asynchronously, and B.
</I>&gt;<i> wait for a reply.  C. If messages don't turn up in a reasonable period
</I>&gt;<i> of time, stop waiting.
</I>
What is the state of the enumerator at this point? Should it be 
considered &quot;irrecoverably invalidated&quot; as the docs suggests? Does it 
make sense for a gap between messages to invalidate the enumeration in 
this way?

Your use-case is not general enough justify changes to the Subscription 
class. If there is sufficient demand then we will gladly reconsider your 
proposal, but perhaps under a different name or in a different class.

&gt;<i> However, being in a
</I>&gt;<i> community that has helped out, I thought, hmmm... maybe i could at least
</I>&gt;<i> return the favour in a small way.
</I>
Thanks for the feedback. We appreciate the suggestions. It is through 
suggestions like yours that rabbit continues to evolve.



Regards
