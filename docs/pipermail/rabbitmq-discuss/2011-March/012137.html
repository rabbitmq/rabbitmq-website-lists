<PRE>channel.queueDeclare( [emptyStringForQueuename], bool,bool,bool... );
channel.queueBind([emptyStringForQueuename],excName,RoutingKey);

1. how does the channel know which queue to bind. what if it has two queues with random name?

2. How will I add a new binding to a random named queue?

queueDeclare returns the name of the queue it declared, so you would change it to

string qname = channel.queueDeclare( [emptyStringForQueuename], bool,bool,bool... );
channel.queueBind(qname,excName,RoutingKey);
