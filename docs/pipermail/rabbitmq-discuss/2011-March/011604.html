</I>&gt;<i> Or failing that, perhaps a bit like the &quot;real time record&quot; model, such as used for financial data, where a consumer gets the last published update for a topic. IIRC the guys at Rabbit HQ did some work on an exchange which persists the last update to a topic - what became of that? This would fit the problem definition quite well, I think.
