<PRE>Thanks Matthew, this is great information. I have just a few more questions
in-line below:

</I>
Can you direct me toward acknowledged, tested RAM requirements? I've seen
some information pass by in the list and other docs but would like to see
something concrete.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exchanges and bindings are even cheaper in terms of the memory cost.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Rephrasing:
Say I have an application consisting of a server to 20,000 agents. Each
agent-server request/response conversation can be broken down into 15 basic
classification types with say 5 sub-conversation types. If I leverage topic
exchanges for their behavioral flexibility, primarily use hierarchical
routing keys and say, create a topic per major classification/conversation
and use more specific routing keys for sub-converstations creating more
lower-cost Bindinds, are you saying that is not more performant than going
with an exponential amount of direct exchanges and more queues? I can
partition and load balance the queues that would handle the very large
message payloads easily enough, but for general high-traffic small JSON
payloads/quick turn around for instance, what is the recommendation?
 
&gt;<i> Doing 10,000+ connections to a single node is also fine. There is
</I>&gt;<i> something somewhere which affects connection creation in RabbitMQ which
</I>&gt;<i> causes a log_2(N) slow down on connection establishment: i.e. whilst
</I>&gt;<i> initially, I can do about 1000 new connections a second, beyond 10,000
</I>&gt;<i> or so connections, the rate of connection establishment slows a little.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
With regard to connections and channels, I wonder if someone can point me to
data or research on thread behavior, leveraging threads going to
sleep/waking up vs creating/closing connections for each client request to
the broker.

 
&gt;<i> What does induce load is binding/exchange churn rate and message rate
</I>&gt;<i> and message size.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A sustained load of N thousand binding creation/deletion events per
</I>&gt;<i> second will likely overwhelm a single machine, and due to the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> such changes have to be distributed to all nodes in a cluster will
</I>&gt;<i> likely also induce substantial load on a large cluster too. Isolating
</I>&gt;<i> such things really requires stuff like federation which AMQP isn't
</I>&gt;<i> really well suited to, in the general case.
</I>
If I am delegating to a Queue to handle runtime requests to create queues,
exchanges, and bindings, might that take care of resultant capacity issues?
I have typically federated JMS brokers and wonder about a similar
topology/configuration.
