Ah, so this is about 'presence'. That has come up a few times before. 
Might be worth searching the archives.

&gt;<i> I am indeed interested in network connects/disconnects, but I would

</I>
Is the fact that a client has connected with a particular user name 
really indicating presence? Or is their presence perhaps only 
established when they start consuming from a queue?

&gt;<i> Other than that, I think my best choice would be to bind to the 
</I>&gt;<i> amq.rabbitmq.log exchange (didn't know about it before) and parse the
</I>&gt;<i>  log messages. However, that seems a bit brittle for me (might change
</I>&gt;<i> between versions), but it would work well.

Unfortunately (for you) there is no log message containing the user name.
