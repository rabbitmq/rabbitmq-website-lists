Well, not that expensive if your RabbitMQ is close to the web server.
Opening channel is a synchronous action - a full roundtrip is required.

To avoid that roundtrip you may hava a pool and reuse open channels.

&gt;<i> And also, does this look like a good approach,
</I>&gt;<i> given the fact that I'll have lots of http connections? I know that RabbitMQ
</I>&gt;<i> was made to scale to a big number of channels.
</I>
Rabbit can handle many channels.
