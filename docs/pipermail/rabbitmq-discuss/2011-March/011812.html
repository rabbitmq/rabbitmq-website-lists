<PRE>So we need it because our clients collaborate on the same resource,
and we want to use the connection essentially as 'presence'
information - that someone is working on the the same resource.

Ideally, we'd pass in a user id when connecting, and we could register
(on the exchange perhaps) to know when that a client comes in and out.

We have to deal with the issue where a user shuts their laptop and the
client goes away. It seems like Rabbit would be well positioned to
tell us that.
