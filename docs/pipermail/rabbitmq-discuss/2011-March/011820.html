<PRE>Hi guys,

I am trying to figure out what's the best way to work with rabbitmq - I am
working on implementing a couple of basic HTTP requests that do some queue
management (with the Pika library and Tornado as web server). One of the
first issues I had was how do I actually get the errors out of Pika when
these happen (say when you're trying to delete a queue that doesn't exist)
and it seems I figured that out, hopefully (channel.add_on_close_callback)

Now, the way I tought this was that I have one rabbitmq connection per
application/web server and one channel as well, which seems pretty bad now
that I look back, since I can't really do particular error logic per request
with only one channel per application. So I am trying to switch away from
this to having one channel per http request. How expensive would be to do
this (one channel per request) from the rabbitmq perspective and also from
the Pika's perspective ? And also, does this look like a good approach,
given the fact that I'll have lots of http connections? I know that RabbitMQ
was made to scale to a big number of channels.

Thanks!
