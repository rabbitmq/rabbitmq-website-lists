<PRE>ok,

the messages seem to still be in the system (so not gone, which good :-) ). after restarting one of the message producers all of the &quot;missing&quot; messages started at once appearing in the queue as expected. is there a known issue with long-running producers?

best regards,
vukasin

&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> we have been using rabbitmq for a while now to route documents through a processing workflow. each step is represented by one or more processes working on one queue. the messages are small (maybe a few k) but there are quite a few of them (multiple thousand per second). This has been working fine for a while but then we have noticed that the rates (each step of the processing workflow delivers stats) do not add up. namely we seem to be losing messages (around 200 messages/sec) and this is quite discerning. The reason is that these messages do not show up in the queue and are also not visible as being recieved and un-acked. we are using non-durable queues and a combination of java and python processing clients.
