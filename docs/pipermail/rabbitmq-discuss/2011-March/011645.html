<PRE>Fabio,

Aces, glad to hear it's working for you thus far.

On this:

 &gt; Just a final question: the previous README file on github said
 &gt; something about including the plugin on the main RabbitMQ code, but I
 &gt; figured this had been written some time ago because it mentioned
 &gt; version 1.7.1. Is this still in your (and RabbitMQ developers) plans?
 &gt; Best regards.

  -- I was referring to the exchange plugin mechanism overall, on which 
I was finishing (largely other people's!) work at the time.  That 
mechanism has been in mainstream rabbitmq since then, and has changed a 
bit, but is pretty stable.

The Last Value Caching exchange will likely stay a plugin for the 
foreseeable future, rather than being baked into rabbitmq-server.  But 
if you follow this list you'll know this is not the last word ..

Michael

&gt;&gt;<i> Oh.  Looks like github's upload and download system is totally broken. (I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now tried to upload it a few times).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've attached the ez so it can be stopped by mail filters instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Michael.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the extra trouble.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've now rebooted my RabbitMQ server and run a few basic tests and
</I>&gt;<i> everything seems to be working as expected. Thank you again for all
</I>&gt;<i> your help and your work on the plugin. I'll keep building my test
</I>&gt;<i> scenarios and I'll let you know if something else comes up.
