<PRE>Hi Brian,

I've just come across this thread:
<A HREF="http://www.trapexit.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=44433">http://www.trapexit.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=44433</A>
which does indeed seem to support the idea that even modest mnesia
databases can take rather more than the 30 seconds we give them to
start up. Given that I would imagine this could happen even in v1.7
with, say, a couple million durable queues, exchanges and bindings,
this is certainly something we will look at as the 30 second timeout
may well be grossly too short.
