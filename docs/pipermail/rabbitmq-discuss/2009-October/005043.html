<PRE>&gt;<i> No, that's not really accurate. It's difficult to say whether a branch
</I>&gt;<i> is &quot;stable&quot; or not. Our basic method is to develop on a branch, then the
</I>&gt;<i> branch will go through QA which may well result in further changes to
</I>&gt;<i> that branch - that may very well create a cluster of small commits over
</I>&gt;<i> the code base as bugs are tracked down or refactorings occur. But at
</I>&gt;<i> this point, the code is getting more stable and improving in quality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 21368 is the basic new persister - v2. This is being grown on a
</I>&gt;<i> different branch into an altered design (v3) which does not use mnesia
</I>&gt;<i> for reasons I've outlined before. 21444 is a set of manual controls that
</I>&gt;<i> extend 21368. Thus from time to time I merge 21368 into 21444. All long
</I>&gt;<i> standing branches get default merged into them from time to time so that
</I>&gt;<i> recent fixes which have been merged into default get propogated out to
</I>&gt;<i> branches. This also helps to ensure infrastructure remains working
</I>&gt;<i> across all branches, and it makes the eventual merge back into default
</I>&gt;<i> easier too.

Ok, thanks for the info.  Would it be possible to have a page where
the most active bug numbers are explained, or a blog entry or two on
lshift that explains them?  You guys are really responsive on this
list, but sometimes it would be cool to be able to find information
without just asking you :)
