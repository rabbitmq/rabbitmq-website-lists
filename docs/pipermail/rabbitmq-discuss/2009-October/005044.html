The short answer is no. The reason is that as a rule, we don't really
like advertising what is on each branch because we would prefer for
people to stick with official releases, or the default branch, unless
they have very good reasons. As soon as we start putting lists up of
what is in what branch, people will use those branches, which makes life
much much harder for us, in terms of offering meaningful support. People
may then be tempted to start merging branches together to get the mix of
features they want... this would rapidly descend into disaster.

Any branch that has been merged into default is considered QA'd and
finished. There are very few long running branches outside of default -
the new persister work, and the AMQP 0.9.1 work are two obvious
examples.
