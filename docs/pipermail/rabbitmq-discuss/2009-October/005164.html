Could you describe your test set up in more detail?

- What clients are you using?
- What is the routing topology, i.e. the numbers of producers,
consumers, exchanges, queues and bindings and how they are &quot;wired up&quot;?
- Are the messages marked as persistent?
- Do producers or consumers use transactions?
- Do consumers consume message with basic.consume or basic.get?
- Do consumers operate in auto-ack or normal, ack'ing mode?
- What do the producers do? Send messages in tight loop?
- How are you measuring speed?
- What hardware, O/S and version of Erlang are you running?

If you could post the test code that would be ideal. Assuming it's
self-contained and well-factored ;)

It may also be worthwhile to compare your results with what you get from
the MulticastMain example program in the Java client.


Matthias.
