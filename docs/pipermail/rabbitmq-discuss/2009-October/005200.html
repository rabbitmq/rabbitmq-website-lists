Subject: Java API V1.6.0 - Performance problem with basicConsume and
dynamic bindings

 

Hello,

 

I am facing a performance issue with the Java Amqp-lib V1.6.0.

On the client side, my use-case is the following:

-          create the amqp connection

-          create a queue that will be dedicated to all incoming
messages: queue A

-          create a channel that will listen to messages coming for
queue A on a subscription basis (basicConsume): channel A

-          create another channel to handle dynamic bindings requests
(will be explained after): channel B

-          start the binding queue A --&gt; channel A thanks to a
basicConsume request through channel A

-          ask for a lot of bindings through Channel B to redirect
incoming market data messages (published by a server which is working
correctly) to queue A (queueBind done through channel B with queue A id)

 

Doing that, after a couple of sec and before having finished to ask for
all &quot;dynamic bindings&quot;, my incoming message listener if falling behind
(messages are waiting on queue A and this number never decrease but
increase).

 

Do you know from where it could come from?

 

Best regards

Franck
