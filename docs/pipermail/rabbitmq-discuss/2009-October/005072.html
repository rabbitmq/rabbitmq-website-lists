Ideally, yes.  Don't want to run 2-3 hour jobs more than necessary. :)


&gt;<i> You can achieve something almost like what you want by creating two

</I>&gt;<i> (eg worker randomly chooses a queue each time a new job is needed).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I was thinking along those lines, but wanted to make sure I wasn't missing
something obvious.  That will require some coding on our end that I was
hoping to avoid.

Many other schemes are possible.  However trying to achieve some total
&gt;<i> order (eg 'first come first serve') may be more complex than you
</I>&gt;<i> really need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> alexis

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Total order isn't necessary, we just want to make a good faith effort to
serve those who's requests came first.

I have a related question... BasicConsume has a &quot;filter&quot; parameter.  It's
been a few months since I read the AMQP spec.  I took a quick look online,
but couldn't find any good documentation.  What does that do (if anything)
and how do you use it?

Ideally, what I was originally fishing for was something like this:

Client:
  headers[&quot;paying&quot;] = &quot;true&quot;;
  bus.Send(message, headers);

Server A:
  bus.Receive(queue=&quot;jobs&quot;, filter=&quot;paying == 'true'&quot;);

Server B:
  bus.Receive(queue=&quot;jobs&quot; /* no filter */);

Thanks,
Bryan
