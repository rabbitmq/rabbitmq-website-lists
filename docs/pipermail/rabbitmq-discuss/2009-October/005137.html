<PRE>Hello there,

We've been stress testing our infrastructure recently and we've been 
surprised to notice that RabbitMQ was really hungry in memory (which is 
more or less okay if we the OS gets it back eventually) but also in CPU.

Our messages are about 100 bytes each and our consumer isn't as fast as 
our producer (though it is very capable in our book) but we have 
difficulties understanding why Rabbit is so CPU bound.

We were also feeling that the queue isn't filled as fast as the exchange 
(topic) and Rabbit seems to feed the queues on demand based on the 
consumer speed. Is it a valid description of what happens or is it a 
false observation on our part?

Thanks for any tips,
- Sylvain
