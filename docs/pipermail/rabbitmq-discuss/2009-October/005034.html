</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, interesting. Is this in a clustered setup, or unclustered?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Unclustered


&gt;<i> How many messages did you have in there, and do you know the average
</I>&gt;<i> size?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Can't know for sure but my guess is about 20 queues, about 500K messages in
each queue, message sizes are about 1KB each.



&gt;<i> The work in 20980 went onto other branches but has not gone onto default
</I>&gt;<i> yet because of issues we uncovered in the persister design. Thus the
</I>&gt;<i> default branch has the same persister as in v1.6. You would probably be
</I>&gt;<i> better off using branch bug21444, which has had the benefit of a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> QA attention and bug fixes. That said, all the usual warnings about
</I>&gt;<i> using unreleased code do apply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Does bug21444 have the disk mode auto-pinning stuff?

I understand about the warnings, the stable branch though would crash almost
immediately with our message load.
