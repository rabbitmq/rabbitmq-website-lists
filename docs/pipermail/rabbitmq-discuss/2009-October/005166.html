In the latter case, each quote would only go to one consumer, which is
probably not what you want. In an AMQP system, to get the same message
delivered to N consumers you need (at least) N queues. Exchanges *copy*
messages to queues, whereas queues *round-robin* message delivery to
consumers.

Your first setup should work fine, except there is no need to use a
topic exchange. Just use a direct exchange, one queue per user and for
each of the stock symbols a user is interested in create a binding
between the user's queue and the direct exchange.

&gt;<i> Users will connect using a browser with long-polling to the mochiweb plugin.
</I>&gt;<i> Each user will be presented at the server side as an erlang AMQP client.
</I>
Have you considered using the rabbitmq-jsonrpc-channel plugin? Even if
you don't want to use it, it's worth taking a look at how it's
implemented since that may well answer some of your questions regarding
long-polling.


Regards,

Matthias.
