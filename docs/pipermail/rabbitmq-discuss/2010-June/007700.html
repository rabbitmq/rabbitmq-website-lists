Well that's not really the case. Windows is more than tolerated, and we
actually make more effort to support Windows than we make to support OS
X. It is the case that Linux is the platform of choice, especially for
a server, but we do not wish to dissuade people from using Rabbit under
other OSes. If there are things we are not doing which we should be
doing to support any OS better, then we want to hear about it, not to
put up some banner saying that we're uninterested.

I am genuinely curious - are we the only makers of software that you use
that you feel constantly doubt the platform you're running on?

That's very true, sorry for that.
