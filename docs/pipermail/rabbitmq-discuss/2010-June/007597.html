Ben Hood at LShift (cc'ed) has been looking into something very much 
like this for a client project. I don't think that project has started 
yet, but he may be able to share his thoughts on this subject with you. 
I reckon the changes required to the rabbit core would be very small. So 
patches are welcome.

Caveat: I wouldn't go anywhere near permission checks just yet; things 
get very complicated very quickly if you do, so I'd just focus on 
authentication and leave authorisation as is. Also, I'd start with just 
being able to specify a single authentication module - that's how all 
the other pluggable things work, i.e. one tells rabbit which module to 
use for a certain piece of functionality.
