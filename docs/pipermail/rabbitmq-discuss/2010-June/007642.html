<PRE>Regarding:

&quot;I recreated some bindings from within the broker (directly in mnesia) and
now things started working again. Is there a better way to re-create the
binding to the default exchange without having to re-create the queue?&quot;

I should probably mention that sending the following queue.bind packet
didn't seem to help (rabbitmqctl list_bindings still shows the binding
missing).

[:sending,
 #&lt;AMQP::Protocol::Queue::Bind:0x9b26778
  @arguments=nil,
  @debug=1,
  @exchange=
   &quot;nanite-rs-instance-fd0416fe31d7b019112c2c0adce9b4e4a261bab1-1094976&quot;,
  @nowait=true,
  @queue=&quot;nanite-rs-instance-fd0416fe31d7b019112c2c0adce9b4e4a261bab1-1094976&quot;,
  @routing_key=nil,
  @ticket=1&gt;]

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It looks like the binding to the default exchange has vanished. That

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> area of the spec; imo it should not be allowed, but rabbit does currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> permit it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No I can't think of a place where we would delete a binding. We only ever
</I>&gt;<i> delete queues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is the default exchange itself still there? Check with 'rabbitmqctl
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list_exchanges'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes the exchange still exists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this reproducible at all? I suspect not :(
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No it has only happens about 15 times on the course of two days. During
</I>&gt;<i> these two days our system was having issues and weird things could have
</I>&gt;<i> happened on the broker (e.g. the queue could have been deleted and
</I>&gt;<i> recreated).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What version of rabbit are you running?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.7.2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I still don't understand what scenario could cause this to happen though
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> especially since the exchange is auto-delete
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Interesting. auto-delete exchanges are very rare. In fact I do not know of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anybody else using them. So it's possible there is a bug in that code that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has laid dormant for years. Can you explain your use-case for auto-delete
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchanges?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Embarrassingly enough, I can't :) The fact that we are using direct
</I>&gt;<i> exchanges for these queues was a bug we introduced, we will be removing
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, what version of rabbit are you running?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.7.2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Obviously I'm still very much interested in finding out what could have
