Good to hear - yeah in a straight line I've seen up to about 30kHz with
noAck turned on, but obviously on a sufficiently parallel machine with
multiple queues, higher overall throughput is possible.

Hmm, I wasn't aware basic.get was quite /that/ slow, but it's possible.
The reason it's in the Getting Started guide is that it is, at least
conceptually, the simplest way of getting a message out of a queue - the
learning curve would be a bit steeper if we immediately started
introducing consume and asynchronous delivery.

&gt;<i> You rock, I've never had a problem solved by a community so fast :)
</I>
Glad to help :) - it's always nice when people take the time to ask us
questions if they're having any problems and refrain from hitting the
ranty-blog button too fast!
