</I>
We will soon be releasing the first milestone of our Spring AMQP project. That includes support at the same basic level as Spring's JMS support (AmqpTemplate, SimpleMessageListenerContainers for Message-driven POJOs, MessageConverter strategies, and more). We will be providing Spring Integration Channel Adapters, Gateways, etc. that will build on top of that functionality.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since RabbitMQ was recently acquired by SpringSource, SI w/OpenCredo

</I>
We're going to be collaborating with OpenCredo on the project I mentioned above, and that project is actually quite active already. However, as I mentioned, we're just now approaching the first milestone release. We'll be moving to Git any moment now, but until it's moved, you can browse the current codebase here: <A HREF="https://src.springsource.org/svn/se-amqp/trunk/">https://src.springsource.org/svn/se-amqp/trunk/</A> (after the move it will be at git.springsource.org/spring-amqp)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although Apache Camel seems to be more mature, I'd rather go the
</I>&gt;<i> Spring Integration route since all of our apps already use Spring for
</I>&gt;<i> dependency injection, etc.
</I>
As the lead of Spring Integration, I'm a bit biased. That said, if your main concern is having a solid (and &quot;mature&quot; I might add) Spring foundation with implementations that are absolutely consistent with Spring, then Spring Integration is probably the best choice (and 2.0 GA is only a couple months away).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can someone from Rabbit comment on the state of development with
</I>&gt;<i> respect to integration with Spring? Is the contributions from
</I>&gt;<i> OpenCredo going to be used?
</I>
Hopefully this question has been answered above. Let me know if there is anything that I missed.

Regards,
Mark
