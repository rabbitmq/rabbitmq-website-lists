Yes, that is correct. The main cause of that is the need to do an fsync,
which is unavoidable. Also, in the current (&quot;old&quot;) persister, commits
happen at most every 2ms, to allow for coalescing of multiple concurrent
transactions into a single fsync. The new persister is somewhat more
clever here.

In the current persister transactions involving the *same queue* are 
completely serialised. That changes in the new persister.

&gt;<i> If so, this suggests queuing up messages client side and having a

</I>
You don't need to submit the messages/acks themselves in batches, and in 
fact doing so is detrimental to performance. Just send them straight 
away but avoid performing a *commit* after every action.


Regards,

Matthias.
