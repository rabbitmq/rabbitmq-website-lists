I just mentioned your affiliation because it is the reason why I attached
credibility to your original message --- it was not an uninformed claim by a
random poster :-)



&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; When you publish a message with delivery mode 2 you are *not*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _guaranteed_
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that it hits disk. Publishing is an async operation and you get no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; confirmation that it goes to disk. The new persister does very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aggressive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; caching in order to avoid doing lots of tiny and expensive writes. As
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; such, there will frequently be times where if you restart the broker,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; will lose several (maybe hundreds) of messages. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note that I'm referring to what happens in case of a hard RabbitMQ/system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crash. The behavior described by Matthew Sackman is consistent with what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> observed in the tests I did before writing ocamlmq: RabbitMQ accepting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> persistent messages at fairly high rates, with quickly growing memory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and no disk activity.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The behaviour you have described is an intentional design of AMQP. Yes,
</I>&gt;<i> you could decide you want to write every message to disk and fsync it,
</I>&gt;<i> but if you do that then you'll have utterly atrocious performance.
</I>&gt;<i> Anything less that this leaves open the possibility of data loss in the
</I>&gt;<i> event of a hard system crash. How much data can be lost is, in the case
</I>&gt;<i> of AMQP, left to the client to decide: they can vary the size of the
</I>&gt;<i> transactions as they wish - if they can tolerate at most one message
</I>&gt;<i> being lost, then they must tx.commit after every publish. This will
</I>&gt;<i> likely result in an fsync per message, and performance will be very
</I>&gt;<i> poor, but the fact is that it's the client who is able to make decisions
</I>&gt;<i> as to the amount of data that can be lost.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Without transactions, publishing is an async activity, and whilst you
</I>&gt;<i> can indicate that the message should be written to disk if it ends up in
</I>&gt;<i> a durable queue, this is merely guidance
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> by writing lazily rather than eagerly, we eliminate 3 disk writes (msg
</I>&gt;<i> published, msg delivered, msg acknowledged).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This makes perfect sense.



&gt;<i> I have no desire to pass comment on ocamlmq. RabbitMQ tries to solve a
</I>&gt;<i> very broad category of messaging patterns and requirements. By no means
</I>&gt;<i> is it perfect - for some it is too slow, whilst for others it does not
</I>&gt;<i> offer enough guarantees. But AMQP does have the advantage of giving a
</I>&gt;<i> great amount of flexibility to the user, which is why we believe
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ is a sound, general purpose solution for a very broad class of
</I>&gt;<i> messaging needs. Careful use of the client libraries and the features
</I>&gt;<i> made available by AMQP is frequently sufficient to satisfy most needs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I do not have anything to object to this either; we are in full agreement.
ocamlmq is just a simple task queue / IPC system I wrote to satisfy my own
requirements (which I was unable to do with RabbitMQ + its STOMP adapter)
and is by no means a general purpose messaging system like RabbitMQ.
