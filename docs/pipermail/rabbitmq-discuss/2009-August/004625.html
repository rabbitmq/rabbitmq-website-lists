<PRE>&gt;<i> Is there any command line method to explicitly delete a durable queue?
</I>
Something which one of my colleagues has been looking for is a fully interactive realtime monitoring and controlling application, so that from a graphical console you can monitor all exchanges, all the queues bound to them, who is using those queues at any given moment, how many messages are queued, what the throughput stats are etc, and be able to manually remove or create exchanges, queues and users, purge queues, that sort of thing. Are the tools around to enable this sort of management tool to be developed?  We currently have a number of messaging systems in use (3rd party and written in house) and they have administrative applications with varying degrees of granularity, and this kind of resource monitoring is crucial to ensuring that problems can be headed off before they become critical. A graphical front end onto a message broker enabling full real-time control and monitoring would be a huge step forward, but we're not sure where to start.
