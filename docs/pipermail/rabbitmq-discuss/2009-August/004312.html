<PRE>The solution is to synchronise the .erlang.cookie files between the service and the controller, which I think is sub optimal if you want to administer more than one service on multiple platforms, unless I'm missing something.

Administering the broker is really important.

Indeed - we use service accounts to run our production services - using these I'm seeing the same problem.
Is there workaround - or should I raise a bug?

I think I had the same issue before on windows....simply go to the RabbitMQ service...right click-&gt; properties..... and change the LOGON user to be your username + password....then RabbitMQ should start up and all should be cool ;-)
That's a bit of a nasty kludge, though. Usually in a production environment you don't want services logging on with real user credentials.
