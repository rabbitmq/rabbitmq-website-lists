That sounds right to me, based on what Paul's been saying he needs.


&gt;<i> Another idea I've played with is splitting the vhosts or clusters up
</I>&gt;<i> and optionally only replicating internally on each one to a reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> limit for availability control. In this case, sharding methods like
</I>&gt;<i> bucket selection could be used to assign producers to a single cluster
</I>&gt;<i> or vhost combo taking the need to cycle out. Consumers could either
</I>&gt;<i> connect to a single cluster or vhost or many as appropriate for the
</I>&gt;<i> flow characteristics expected.
</I>
Yes, although I think you would need high loads to justify the
additional management overhead.


&gt;<i> The only plusses of this are the fact that you can scale complex
</I>&gt;<i> exchange/queue setups w/o having to generate and track a lot of unique
</I>&gt;<i> routing keys that need to be coordinated with the consumer side.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead you just have a list of hosts that can be used.
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> I've also
</I>&gt;<i> thought of a few ways one could put a load balancer in front of this
</I>&gt;<i> quite easily on either side if there is a concern with how smart a
</I>&gt;<i> client must be.
</I>
IMO this is a good way to go.
