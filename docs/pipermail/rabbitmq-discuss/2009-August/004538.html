<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Assuming that there is a known identifier for each game (database id,
</I>&gt;<i> guid,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or equivalent), what about using a single direct exchange, with the
</I>&gt;<i> routing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; key being set to the game id each time. When a player connects, they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; subscribe to the exchange with all of the routing keys for the games that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they are interested in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you subscribe one queue to one exchange with multiple keys, or is
</I>&gt;<i> the idea that each player would use one queue per game?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The one queue can be bound to a single exchange with multiple routing keys;
so each player would only need to have a single queue. Depending on how you
access Rabbit, it might also be worth putting the routing key into the
message body, just to make it a bit more accessible (since some apis don't
provide the easiest access to the routing key).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as scalability is concerned, using a direct exchange with many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; routing keys should hopefully be no worse than many fanout exchanges with
</I>&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; routing keys. If you're considering the clustering scenario, exchange
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information is replicated to all nodes - so it isn't like there is a
</I>&gt;<i> single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point that all messages need to go through.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good to know.  I wasn't too worried about using one direct exchange,
</I>&gt;<i> but using one topic exchange seemed like a bad idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Paul.
