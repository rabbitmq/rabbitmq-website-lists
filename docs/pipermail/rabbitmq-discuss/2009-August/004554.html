<PRE>I guess Linux-HA takes care of the failover requirement. The 1s or
more of downtime isn't really a big concern for me. The truth is that
my bigger concern is scalability. I'm glad to hear that it's what your
priority is right now. Do you have a roadmap for when a scalable queue
will be available?

Just to give you a little more information on what I'm doing, I'm
building a live search/aggregation system. I'm hoping to push updates
of a constant internet crawl through the messaging system so workers
can analyze the content and build indexes as everything comes in.
That's why 1s or so of downtime isn't that big of a concern while
scalability is.

Thanks,
Paul
