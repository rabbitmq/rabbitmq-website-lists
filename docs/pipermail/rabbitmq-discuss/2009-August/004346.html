<PRE>Hi,

I am facing a typical issue while fetching a channel from the connection
while using Java client.

In my code, I was utilizing a connection that is alive and fetching
channels by calling connection.getChannel(); 
While my application server was running for over 3 days, I found that
getting channel obj via calling connection.getChannel() would return
null.

Investigation lead to my not closing the channel after publishing a
message. And I have now closed the channel as soon as I publish. 

Are there any other known scenarios where we would get the channel
object as null. 

My connection params has requestedChannels as 0, requestedHeartbeat as
360 secs. Please suggest.

Regards,
