<PRE>Hi Matthias,

I think so, there is something going wrong and trying to resubscribe on
an existing queue.
I have added some debug info to the log files, so may be I will get more
information regarding why is this happening.

Thanks a lot for your help
Rajesh

In that case I do not understand the problem. With an exclusive queue
when &quot;some exception occurs and the connection dies&quot; the queue will get
deleted. So on reconnecting you should simply re-declare (and re-bind)
the exclusive queue and start consuming from it.

You must be doing something different though, since the RESOURCE_LOCKED
error indicates that an attempt was made to re-declare the queue when it
existed already, and from a different connection to the one that created
it.



Regards,

Matthias.
