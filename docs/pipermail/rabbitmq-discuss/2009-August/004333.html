<PRE>Hi Matthias,

We do use the queuename supplied by client. It is unique as we use the
processid + userid + datetime in it.
I think the error we are getting might be because of the issue you have
mentioned where the connection terminates non-cleanly.

Thanks
Rajesh

Is the client naming the queue or is it getting the server to generate a
name for it?

The reason I am asking is that if you re-use the same queue name then
there is an unavoidable race condition which might trigger the
RESOURCE_LOCKED error. Specifically, if the connection terminates
non-cleanly, e.g. it gets dropped due to a client or network failure,
and you then immediately reconnect, the auto-deletion of resources of
the old connection may not have happened yet.

I reckon it is unlikely you'd run into this, since the auto-deletion
happens quite quickly, but it is a possibility.


Regards,

Matthias.
