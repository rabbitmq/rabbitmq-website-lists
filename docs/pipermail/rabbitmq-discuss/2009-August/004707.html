<PRE>While I've not completed my migration from ActiveMQ to RabbitMQ, every
indication is that it is faster in my work load.  I do not have
thousands of consumers, but I do have thousands of clients connecting,
enqueueing and disconnecting.

In this scenario, connection times in ActiveMQ increase over the
course of days, starting at 4ms and if left unattended to, increase
to100's of ms.  The only way to resolve this is to restart the
ActiveMQ broker which is disruptive and an operational issue for us.

In addition, load tests show that ActiveMQ slows considerably with
steady enqueue with no dequeue, over the course of 1000's of messages.
 I ran this same test with RabbitMQ runs steady until it runs out of
memory which for my tests was around 2M messages.

Regards,

Gavin

</I>&gt;<i> This is due to the configuration out of the box for ActiveMQ - its very
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward for ActiveMQ to handle the same load as RabbitMQ.
</I>&gt;<i> There are some significant benefits in using ActiveMQ over RabbitMQ.
</I>&gt;<i> ActiveMQ has no limit on the depth (number of messages) in a Queue -
</I>&gt;<i> other than disk space. RabbitMQ runs out of memory.
</I>&gt;<i> Also - there's performance benefits too - although sending messages can
</I>&gt;<i> be a lot faster to RabbitMQ (this is due to RabbitMQ caching messages in
</I>&gt;<i> memory) - consuming messages is considerably slower.
</I>&gt;<i> In reality, RabbitMQ is just hype ware - not really suitable for
</I>&gt;<i> production scenarios. Although its getting a lot of traction, it only
</I>&gt;<i> suitable for cases where consumers will always keep up with producers.
</I>&gt;<i> =============== END OF QUOTE ======================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that's a pretty scary assesment there. &quot;Hype ware&quot;... Perhaps RabbitMQ's
</I>&gt;<i> engineers can reply to this, and reassure us that our shift in favour of
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ is a sound decision? (we plan to deploy it on systems with plenty
</I>&gt;<i> gigs of RAM).
