</I>&gt;&gt;<i> game starts. &#160;When the game ends there will be no more events from it,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so the exchange is deleted. &#160;It's possible for a game to end before

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchange with routing keys like &quot;joe.sally.bob&quot; and subscribe with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> patterns like &quot;#.bob.#&quot;, but putting all the messages through one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> topic exchange doesn't seem like it would scale well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming that there is a known identifier for each game (database id, guid,
</I>&gt;<i> or equivalent), what about using a single direct exchange, with the routing
</I>&gt;<i> key being set to the game id each time. When a player connects, they
</I>&gt;<i> subscribe to the exchange with all of the routing keys for the games that
</I>&gt;<i> they are interested in.
</I>
Can you subscribe one queue to one exchange with multiple keys, or is
the idea that each player would use one queue per game?

&gt;<i> As far as scalability is concerned, using a direct exchange with many
</I>&gt;<i> routing keys should hopefully be no worse than many fanout exchanges with no
</I>&gt;<i> routing keys. If you're considering the clustering scenario, exchange
</I>&gt;<i> information is replicated to all nodes - so it isn't like there is a single
</I>&gt;<i> point that all messages need to go through.
</I>
Good to know.  I wasn't too worried about using one direct exchange,
but using one topic exchange seemed like a bad idea.

Thanks,
