<PRE>Anybody run across this being raised by the RabbitMQ Client (dotnet) before?

&quot;Unable to write data to the transport connection: An established connection
was aborted by the software in your host machine.&quot;

it appears to be frustratingly intermittent...

possibly some kind of buried timeout?

The only thing remotely related I found was this thread...

thanks in advance.
