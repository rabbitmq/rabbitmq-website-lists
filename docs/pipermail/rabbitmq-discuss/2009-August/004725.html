You could use read ACLs that only permit certain users to creating
bindings to a certain exchange - this would limit anybody's ability to
multicast messages. But you'd still have to do it manually.

&gt;<i> For you second proposition, I believe you assume that my subscribing

</I>&gt;<i> the good one. Isn't it?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Another question I have is: How can I monitor a queue? I would like to
</I>&gt;<i> know when a queue goes down.
</I>
You can't via the protocol ATM. Right now you can use the rabbitmqctl
interface.  BQL will be available as a plugin in the next release, but
this just gives you similar semantics to rabbitmqctl.

&gt;<i> For the moment, all my subscribers clients create their own queue when
</I>&gt;<i> they start (let's say subscribe.A#PING for client A and subscribe.B#PING
</I>&gt;<i> for client B) and they give these queue ids to the publishing client.
</I>&gt;<i> After that, nothing is done on these queues but the publishing client is
</I>&gt;<i> watching at them (through a queueDeclare with passive=true) and if a
</I>&gt;<i> queues goes down, the publishing client consider that the subscribing
</I>&gt;<i> client has shutted-down and it clean his internal cache in as a
</I>&gt;<i> consequence.
</I>
Yes, this whole area is an issue. The wheels are in motion to
introduce some kind of presence notification, but this requires a lot
more thought and development and hence there's no ETA.

For now what you can do from a sending perspective is to set the
mandatory flag - this will result in a return if the message could not
be routed.

Cheers,

Ben

PS I've looked at the mailman admin to send if there is a pending
request from you, which there isn't. Can you maybe send the rejection
message please?
