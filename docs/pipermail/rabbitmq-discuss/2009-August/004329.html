<PRE>Hi Matthias,

We need the exclusive queue as the queue should auto delete if the
consumer dies/shuts down.
What is the best approach for resubscribing if some excpetion occurs and
the conenction dies.

Thanks
Rajesh

Exclusive queues are owned by the connection that created them. The 
general idea is for that (and *only* that) connection to subscribe 
consumer(s) to the queue. Exclusive queues are deleted when the 
connection goes away.

May I ask why you declare the queue as exclusive? Wouldn't a 
non-exclusive queue fit your use case better?


Regards,

Matthias
