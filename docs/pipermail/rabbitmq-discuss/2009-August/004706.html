<PRE>For what it's worth I've been using RabbitMQ in a production system  
running 24/7 for more than 2 year, running flawlessly. I wouldn't  
hesitate to use it again.

Whether it will solve your specific issues or not, I can't tell.

Also, I believe in the AMQP standard effort as I feel less &quot;locked in&quot;  
than with other solutions.

YMMV.

Regards,

Michael Arnoldus

</I>&gt;<i> This is due to the configuration out of the box for ActiveMQ - its

</I>&gt;<i> straightforward for ActiveMQ to handle the same load as RabbitMQ.
</I>&gt;<i> There are some significant benefits in using ActiveMQ over RabbitMQ.
</I>&gt;<i> ActiveMQ has no limit on the depth (number of messages) in a Queue -
</I>&gt;<i> other than disk space. RabbitMQ runs out of memory.
</I>&gt;<i> Also - there's performance benefits too - although sending messages  
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> be a lot faster to RabbitMQ (this is due to RabbitMQ caching  
</I>&gt;<i> messages in
</I>&gt;<i> memory) - consuming messages is considerably slower.
</I>&gt;<i> In reality, RabbitMQ is just hype ware - not really suitable for
</I>&gt;<i> production scenarios. Although its getting a lot of traction, it only
</I>&gt;<i> suitable for cases where consumers will always keep up with producers.
</I>&gt;<i> =============== END OF QUOTE ======================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that's a pretty scary assesment there. &quot;Hype ware&quot;... Perhaps
