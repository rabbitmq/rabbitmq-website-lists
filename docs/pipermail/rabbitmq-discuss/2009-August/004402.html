Yes, it does say that in 0-8 but that version of the spec was in
itself not exactly perfect, so some aspects of it should be taken with
a pinch of salt.

&gt;<i> If a client gets (unpredictably) disconnected (e.g. a brief network
</I>&gt;<i> problem), the current implementation would immediately delete the
</I>&gt;<i> queue, yeah?
</I>
As Matthias points out, it would be tricky to make this predictable.
So even though it is written into the spec, it doesn't necessarily
mean that it is a sensible thing to mandate (at least from a
cost-benefit perspective).

&gt;<i> I'm switching over from qpid (which does provide a delay before
</I>&gt;<i> auto-deleting) so am trying to sort through any redesigns I'll need.
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like I'll want to set auto-delete to false and explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> handle queue deletion from the clients.
</I>
Is there any reason why you are switching from qpid?
