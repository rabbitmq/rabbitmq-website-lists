<PRE>
I would like to understand which approach suits the best to manage the below
scenario.

Say for example there are 25 applications mostly in java and are web based
deployed across different platforms jboss, websphere &amp; tomcat. Each
application exposes 3 -5 services and also consumes services from other
applications. Most of them are synchronous and are triggered on need basis.
Some of the use cases below,

When a patient is admitted, this sends out message to 4 -5 systems which are
interested in admission detail (sync).
Billing system send detail to another system to calculate the discount
(sync)
Get Patient detail by passing the id. (sync)
So if u try to represent the whole diagram in a picutre if will be like so
many hardcoded static lines between each and every system.

The problems 1. No common way to find the health of each systems or web
services until the user complains some thing not working.

Too many web services and end points to keep track off.

Implemented across diff standards JAX-wS, Jax-RS, due to diff application
servers and containers.

Some messages are identical with slightly different details. Thus
reusability is reduced and end up coming up with new service for each custom
requirement.

Solutions What kind of solutions better suites to address the above issues ?

Thank you for ur time.

Regards, Naz
