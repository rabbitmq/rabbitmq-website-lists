It has deliberately moved on from a model explicitly based on exchanges, 
binding and queues. It has generalised the model, making it simpler and 
more consistent, while supporting the same patterns.

I would disagree that the exchange/queue/binding was the real meat of AMQP.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder ;-) I don't think its fair to say 
it dumbs down the protocol though, as it is more capable than previous 
versions (more control over different options for reliability, more 
control over managing the flow of messages, standardised approaches to 
message signing etc).

The fact that TCP provides acking and flow control is not sufficient in 
many cases. An application level protocol still needs to have a solution 
to these, particularly one that aims to be a general protocol for 
asynchronous message transfer.
