<PRE>Lionel,

&gt;<i> Without colon escaping, the header line &quot;a:b:c&quot; is ambiguous and can be
</I>&gt;<i> parsed either as (name &quot;a&quot; &amp; value &quot;b:c&quot;) or (name &quot;a:b&quot; &amp; value &quot;c&quot;).
</I>
No. It's not ambiguous. It is the name &quot;a&quot; and value &quot;b:c&quot;. Colons only
need to be escaped in the name, NOT in the value. The FIRST colon
delimits the name. That's it.

&gt;<i> The reason behind this being in the spec is that the broker may need to
</I>&gt;<i> understand (= decode) what is in the header, for instance for envelope
</I>&gt;<i> based routing (e.g. a topic exchange or JMS-style message selectors).
</I>
If the broker (or anyone else) stipulates they need a header value, they
define how it is encoded. If a client needs to know what it &quot;means&quot; they
will also know how to decode it.  UTF-8 strings are fine, but why force
everyone to use them?

&gt;&gt;<i> Well, my point is we had (almost) enough already and 1.1 gave us less.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How is any binary OCTET sequence worse than any UTF-8 text string?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because it lacks information on how to decode/interpret it.
</I>
No it doesn't. And saying it is UTF8 doesn't tell anyone anything useful
anyway. That information is implicit -- like UTF8 is implicit. If the
broker needs to pass headers to some other process/system it must
understand what format is required AND HOW THAT IS RENDERED IN UTF8. Raw
binary would be a nightmare, as would IEEE floating point, or object
references, or anything other than a String.

I repeat: there is no conceivable advantage in this rule, and it makes
life harder for brokers and clients.
