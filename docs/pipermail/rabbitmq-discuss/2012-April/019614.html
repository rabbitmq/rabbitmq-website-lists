Just to be clear, you are worried that the queues created by federation 
at the upstream will somehow disappear?

That would be a bug and as such is just as likely to happen as any other 
fault.

Looks like you are re-inventing what the federation logic already 
provides, i.e. a means to buffer messages while the link is down.

Matthias.
