<PRE>Yes, but properly done, a Rabbit .pkg should install Erlang in such a way that only Rabbit so installed can see it.  I believe this is what the ejabberd pkg does. 

Also, near as I can tell Alvaro is trying to make this a reality with his own labor, and is simply running into issues with the build process. That seems like an effort worth supporting given the benefits.
