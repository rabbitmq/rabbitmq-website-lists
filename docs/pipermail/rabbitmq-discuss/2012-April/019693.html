<PRE>The reason I was drawn to AMQP was that the API (as far as I could tell
from the RabbitMQ tutorial) was fairly intuitive how I could implement the
communication patterns that my applications used.

Is there any documentation that describes the changes from 0.9x to 1.0?
 Does the AMQP group have any formal statement as to why they changed the
API so significantly?

Thanks.

Dan

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Absolute AMQP and RabbitMQ newbie here, so please point to the
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate place for this discussion if this is not it.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We're about to embark on a new project, and am considering AMQP for it.
</I>&gt;<i>  We're hoping to unify at least 4 different messaging/communication
</I>&gt;<i> systems, and replace them with a single enterprise-wide message bus.  As we
</I>&gt;<i> have apps in at least 3 languages, on 2 OSs, and would like remain
</I>&gt;<i> vendor-independent, AMQP sounds like a good fit.  RabbitMQ seems like a
</I>&gt;<i> great implementation for our needs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, I'm concerned about the lack of a current AMQP 1.0
</I>&gt;<i> implementation in RabbitMQ - I would hate to write the software using 0.9
</I>&gt;<i> and have to rewrite it to support 1.0 once an implementation became
</I>&gt;<i> available.  If other vendors implement 1.0, it is not clear that will keep
</I>&gt;<i> support for 0.9 around, in which case I would not see the benefit of vendor
</I>&gt;<i> independence.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess I was just curious as to RabbitMQ's plans to implement (or not)
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0 and what that timeline looked like.  I'd be also curious to hear how
</I>&gt;<i> hard it would be to convert an application from 0.9 to 1.0.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for your help.
