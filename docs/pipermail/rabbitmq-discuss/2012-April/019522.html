Indeed, and any sane package manager should do that for you. In fact
ideally, you shouldn't be downloading anything from our website - you
should just use your platform's native package manager and it should
install as you wish something that's appropriate for your particular
platform. The fact that that doesn't work for many people is somewhat
distressing.

&gt;<i> I agree with you Matthew that you should learn how to compile Erlang,

Actually, I'm not saying that. If you just want to evaluate a bunch of
different message brokers, then no, I don't think you should take the
gentoo approach to everything. Even in a university course about
messaging, time is probably better spent not compiling Erlang. However,
in such a educational situation, I would say that learning your way
around toolchains is valuable. I would also hope that a course on
messaging didn't require every student to compile their own version of
Erlang and instead both Erlang and Rabbit would be provided on a
lab-wide system install.
