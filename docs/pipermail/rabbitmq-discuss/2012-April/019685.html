<PRE>Hi Jason, Gordon,

Interesting discussion.

I think Jason has a point in that AMQP/1.0 has deliberately dropped to 
&quot;model&quot; part of spec (i.e. exchanges/queues/bindings) which was the real 
meat of the protocol.

I have no idea what the reasons were. In any case it dumbs down the 
protocol to the extent where it becomes an ugly version of TCP built on 
top of TCP.

I have to disagree though that ZeroMQ/Crossroads did a similar thing. 
Instead of dropping the AMQP model, my goal was to refine it, remove 
weird cases (like broadcasting messages to multiple queues, then 
load-balancing them to the consumers) and make the concepts implicitly 
contained in AMQP model, like request/reply, publish/subscribe etc. even 
more explicit.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is certainly not limited to - or even focused on - integration with

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quoting from a JPMorgan preso on 1.0 as to the design goals:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Simplify wire protocol
</I>&gt;<i> * Global Addressing
</I>&gt;<i> * Create a model more easy to retro-fit to legacy
</I>&gt;<i> brokers
</I>&gt;<i> * Extensible layered protocol
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of these serve federation and integration (i.e. broker writers),
</I>&gt;<i> not the app developer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> THE reason nodes/links/filters became the new 1.0 primitives was
</I>&gt;<i> precisely to enable easier federation with non-AMQP brokers. Want to
</I>&gt;<i> forward a message on to a federated broker? No problem, attach another
</I>&gt;<i> link pointing to the federated broker with the right filter. 1.0
</I>&gt;<i> exists to make life easier on broker implementers and integrators, not
</I>&gt;<i> to help app developers/users. It puts the burden on the app developer
</I>&gt;<i> to build up the actual primitive he wants. Again, ZMQ is a better 1.0
</I>&gt;<i> than 1.0: it has similar primitives, is simpler, and doesn't pretend
</I>&gt;<i> to be anything other than a transport erector set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an OASIS standard now, I foresee AMQP 1.0 continuing on it's trek
</I>&gt;<i> to serve it's corporate masters/designers...which would be fine if it
</I>&gt;<i> didn't throw app developers and their productivity to the wolves as
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0 has done.
