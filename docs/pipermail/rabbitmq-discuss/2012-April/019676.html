I don't think it is.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the point or perhaps it depends on 
perspective. I would accept that the 1.0 specification *as a document* 
is not particularly useful to an app developer and indeed they were not 
the intended audience.

An app developer in my view would generally be using an AMQP library, 
rather than implementing the protocol directly, and I can't see how that 
would be made any more difficult (if anything for a certain class of 
users at least I think it would be more intuitive).

Whether it is more difficult to *implement* such a library is of course 
also a different question.

&gt;<i> It solves a very narrow problem set best suited to integrating AMQP brokers better with other non-AMQP brokers.
</I>
I very much disagree.

It is certainly not limited to - or even focused on - integration with 
non-AMQP brokers though it is deliberately less imposing in terms of a 
broker implementations internal architecture to promote even wider adoption.

I don't believe the target problem set has narrowed since earlier 
versions however, if anything it is the reverse.

What important problems does it not address in your view?
