I think the idea of such package is mostly to ease adoption. If you want to make internode communication between Riak, Ejabberd and RabbitMQ then you probably know how to get your Erlang up and running.

BTW, creating this .tar is something supported by OTP, it's not a hack. So I guess someone is using that in production already. The guys behind erlware created this tool to work with releases: <A HREF="https://github.com/erlware/sinan/wiki">https://github.com/erlware/sinan/wiki</A> so I guess they probably use that. Also rebar supports generating releases, I guess that's what Riak does with their distros.

Also I don't think these releases conflict with each other. The only problem I can see is what happens with the epmd instance they will start. AFAIK Ejabberd kills it if no other Erlang process is running once the server exits.
