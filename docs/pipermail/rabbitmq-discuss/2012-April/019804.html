<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I'm running RabbitMQ 2.71/R14B04 on RHEL 6.2 and am encountering scaling 
issues with (I believe) RMQ. I'm interested in using the hipe_compile or 
other configurations to tune RMQ's throughput. Right now we get around 20k 
messages per second, but anything beyond that the queues begin to grow 
(there are a number of producer/consumer workers and around 15 
queues/exchanges they read/write to). Each worker is acknowledging messages 
as they are processed and sent on to the next process. The messages have 
variable size.

 I've changed the frame_max setting but that doesn't appear to help. I've 
tried increasing the number of workers across additional hardware as well, 
but Rabbit still seems to cap at 20k message/sec. When I set hipe_compile 
to true, the systems states 'Not HiPE compiling: HiPE not found in this 
Erlang installation.' What's odd is that erlang-hipe-R14B-04.1.el6.x86_64 
is installed. Is there something else that needs to be done for RHEL 
systems to enable hipe_compile? I think that it may help get beyond the 
current problem. If that doesn't help, are there other settings or 
something I can look at to determine where the bottleneck is? The RMQ 
server is 60% idle, doesn't have a large amount of I/O wait, and doesn't 
seem to be saturating its network cards (the server has a bonded ethernet 
interface). The worker machines are relatively idle as well.

Thanks,

 Chris
