<PRE>Steve,

Ah!  That was it!  Thank you very much for that and sorry for my ignorance.  When I had all the machines up and the messages made it to Machine A, if I restarted it, all of the messages were still in place, so I assumed that the messages were persistant.  As you indicated, this was not the case.  Once I added the delivery_mode setting you suggested to my publish call, I was able to restart Machine C and the messages were still present.  Apply palm to forehead and problem solved.

Thank you again for your help with this.

Regards,
Sean

Sean,

Please check that the messages are 'persistent' messages (published with
BasicProperties containing delivery_mode=2). If not they won't survive a
restart; only persistent messages in durable queues survive a restart.

I note that you have set persistent in the shovel configuration, but
this only overrides the properties of the original message. If they
weren't persistent originally and shovel doesn't re-publish them, they
will be lost on restart.

Steve,

Thank you very much for helping me out.  I actually stop Machine A.  That prevents messages from being shoveled from Machine C  to A.  While A is still stopped, I restart the RabbitMQ service Machine C.

When I do this, I figured since the messages are in a durable queue on Machine C, they would still be in the durable queue on C waiting to be shoveled to A.  This isn't the case though-they are simply gone.  They don't make it to A (since A is stopped), but they aren't on C anymore either.  I was thinking I probably have something configured wrong or that there is a setting I can tweak to make them persist on C.

Thank you again for your help on this...

Regards,
Sean

Hi Sean,

Did you mean to say you restarted Machine C or Machine A?

In any case, the messages in a durable queue will only survive a server
stop/start if the messages are persistent.

If you restarted Machine A, then the shovel ought to reconnect (from C
to A) and the messages in the queue should then be sent. Since the queue
on Machine A is durable it ought to still exist when you restart it.

Hope this gives some clue. If you still have problems, please come back.

Hello,

I am new to the list and RabbitMQ in general, so I hope this is not a stupid question, but I have seen some behavior that is strange to me when using the RabbitMQ shovel plugin.  I am using RabbitMQ v 2.7.1 running on Centos 6.0.  I have three machines in my setup.  Machines A and B are both clustered together.  Machine C is not part of the cluster.  It has the shovel plugin installed.  The plugin is set up to shovel messages from a durable queue on Machine C to a durable queue on Machine A.  In case it helps, my /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf file looks like this:

[{rabbitmq_shovel,
  [{shovels,
    [{myShovel,
      [{sources,      [{broker,&quot;<A HREF="amqp://MachineC&quot;}]},">amqp://MachineC&quot;}]},</A>
       {destinations, [{broker, &quot;<A HREF="amqp://MachineA&quot;}]},">amqp://MachineA&quot;}]},</A>
       {queue, &lt;&lt;&quot;myQueue&quot;&gt;&gt;},
       {ack_mode, on_confirm},
       {publish_properties, [{delivery_mode, 2}]},
       {reconnect_delay, 5}
      ]
    }]
 }]
}].

With this configuration, everything seems to work fine.  When I send messages to the queue on Machine C, they are shoveled automatically out to A.

So here is the weird behavior I mentioned earlier...  If I shut down the RabbitMQ service on Machine A, messages stack up in the durable queue on Machine C.  This is expected since Machine A is down.  However, if I then restart the RabbitMQ service on Machine C, all of the messages waiting in the durable queue get nuked.

Has anyone else seen this behavior?  Do I have a setting wrong or is there something else I can change so that this doesn't happen?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Regards,
Sean
