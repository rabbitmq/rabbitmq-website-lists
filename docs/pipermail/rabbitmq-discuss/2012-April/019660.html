<PRE>Hi Daniel,

AMQP 1.0 is so dissimilar from 0.9x that 1.0 should never have been called AMQP. It's literally as different as going from Gopher to HTTP. 

1.0 is very difficult to use as an app developer. It solves a very narrow problem set best suited to integrating AMQP brokers better with other non-AMQP brokers. 1.0 is architecture astronauts at their best. 

Rabbit is fairly protocol agnostic... 1.0 support was mocked up to my understanding and was able to run alongside 0.9.1. So even if 1.0 took over, 0.9.1 support in Rabbit isn't going anywhere. 

In reality 0.9.1 is a much better protocol for getting real work done as an app developer. The primitives are higher level and much more useful for 99% of the tasks you'll likely want to do. As a result I don't think 0.9.1 is going to go away...particularly amongst most AMQP users. 

Does that help?

&gt;<i> Hello.

</I>&gt;<i> (Absolute AMQP and RabbitMQ newbie here, so please point to the appropriate place for this discussion if this is not it.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We're about to embark on a new project, and am considering AMQP for it.  We're hoping to unify at least 4 different messaging/communication systems, and replace them with a single enterprise-wide message bus.  As we have apps in at least 3 languages, on 2 OSs, and would like remain vendor-independent, AMQP sounds like a good fit.  RabbitMQ seems like a great implementation for our needs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I'm concerned about the lack of a current AMQP 1.0 implementation in RabbitMQ - I would hate to write the software using 0.9 and have to rewrite it to support 1.0 once an implementation became available.  If other vendors implement 1.0, it is not clear that will keep support for 0.9 around, in which case I would not see the benefit of vendor independence.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I was just curious as to RabbitMQ's plans to implement (or not) 1.0 and what that timeline looked like.  I'd be also curious to hear how hard it would be to convert an application from 0.9 to 1.0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your help.
