<PRE>Hi!

I wonder how it is possible to have recv hang if RabbitMQ server has disconnected. Maybe RabbitMQ server has a bug that it does not disconnect a socket.

I am afraid I don't have a succinct example that can reproduce this segfault. It occurred with Net::RabbitMQ versions 0.2.0 and 0.2.2, but not with rabbitmq-c-fb6fca832fd2.

I reported the segmentation fault in CPAN:
<A HREF="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=76205">https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=76205</A>

I got the segmentation fault in subroutine get. I think it is because memory allocation failed.
I have Net::RabbitMQ version 0.2.2. I got a similar bug in Net::RabbitMQ version 0.2.0, too:<A HREF="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=76156">https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=76156</A>
