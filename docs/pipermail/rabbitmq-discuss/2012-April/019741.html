<PRE>Hi Matthias,

I haven't run these same tests on 2.7.1 yet, since its our production 
machines (which are currently stable... enough).

The spiking and the locking is not unusual? ;)
Maybe the large gaps between queue memory and actual memory is not 
unusual also? ;)
Maybe the flat queue sizes for several seconds while hundreds of 
thousands of records are added and purged? ;)

All joking aside.... =)

When RabbitMQ is cleaning its index/journals and data files, the queues 
are all locked. Cleansing a queue could take several seconds/minutes 
depending on the volume. The current flow control {200,50} hides a lot 
of this, since you will not reach a large enough volume to cause a long 
enough 'purge' to notice.

On my test machine, all the non-persistent messages were dropped to disk 
(causing a lock) around 4GB every time. On smaller systems, its usually 
around 1.5 to 2GB.  This happens regardless of any settings on rabbitmq 
or mnesia (unless I missed something).

A work around I have tried which works (up until the 'purge'), was to 
mount the mnesia directory on a RAM disk and change the message to be 
persistent (instead of non).  This fixed the 4GB lock, since everything 
is on disk as its received (with a slight delay).

Thanks
