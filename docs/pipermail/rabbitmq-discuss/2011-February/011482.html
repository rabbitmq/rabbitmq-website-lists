rabbitmq-management will show &quot;?&quot; for these items when it can't get 
information from its statistics database for them. This could be for one 
of several reasons:

* SERVER_2 does not have rabbitmq-management-agent installed
   - in which case all queues on that node will show &quot;?&quot;

* The management statistics database was located on the offline server
   - The stats database will come up on only one node in a cluster, that
     node will be one of the ones the full management plugin is
     installed on. If that node goes down you will lose statistics.

* The management statistics database was located on a server that was
   restarted while the rest of the cluster stayed up.
   - Unfortunately it doesn't deal well with that situation.

Note that the location of the stats database is displayed on the 
overview page.

Does one of these sound like it might be what happened?

Cheers, Simon
