<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> In a scenario with one consumer as I saw in my tests, the consumer
</I>&gt;<i> received messages with the Redelivered=true AMQP header atribute.
</I>&gt;<i> The consumer was based in the classes provided by the .NET API and as
</I>&gt;<i> I remember the consumer-tag is random generated by the server.
</I>
Sounds good.

&gt;<i> When there is a only one consumer (with a random consumer-tag name)
</I>&gt;<i> and a message is not acked when the consumer is reconnected (so has
</I>&gt;<i> another random tag name) that message is redelivered?
</I>
Yes, un-ack'd messages will be redelivered to the consumer when it
reconnects.  Be aware, though, they will be redelivered *after* the
messages still on the queue (i.e. the undelivered ones) are delivered.

So, if the following messages are published to the queue:
  1 2 3 4 5 6

And the following are delivered but not ack'd by the consumer:
  1 2 3

If the consumer crashes and reconnects, the messages delivered in order
will be:
  4 5 6 1 2 3

&gt;<i> Based on my experience I think this is true but don't understand that
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;If that same consumer then reconnects and creates a new subscription
</I>&gt;<i> to the same queue&quot;...
</I>
That's just another way of saying it reconnects and starts consuming
again.

&gt;<i> By the was my consumer always tries to create the queue and the
</I>&gt;<i> bindings every time it connects to RabbitMQ.
</I>
That's perfect.  You should always do that.

&gt;<i> And also I'm wondering how this behavior acts when there are more than
</I>&gt;<i> one consumer (same queue and same bindings)...
</I>
Messages are delivered one at a time to consumers in round-robin order.
If a message is delivered and the consumer dies, the message is
republished to the queue and a consumer will eventually get it (note
that it may be the same client if it reconnects).

&gt;<i> Under what circumstances an unack message wouldn't be redelivered again?
</I>
In none of the circumstances we were talking about.  A client can
basic.reject{requeue=false} a message, in which case it will not be
requeued.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Alex
