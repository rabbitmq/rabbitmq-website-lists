It's not that you *need* to, it's just that most client libraries don't 
make their channel implementations threadsafe. If you use a library that 
does, or if you have one thread with multiple consumers, you don't need 
to open a channel per consumer.

Channels are slightly more expensive in the server than consumers. But 
only slightly. RabbitMQ is designed to scale to very large numbers of 
channels.

Cheers, Simon
