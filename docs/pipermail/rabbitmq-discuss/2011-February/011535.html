<PRE>Hi Pieter,

&gt;<i> I sincerely hope that this is stupid question with an easy answer. I am

There is no intention for this to work.  There are AMQP
version-dependent areas outside of the generated code.  You can see the
complete changes that were involved in the switch of the C client to
0-9-1 at &lt;<A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-c/rev/168205522459">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-c/rev/168205522459</A>&gt;.

With that said, it's probably not that difficult to revert the changes.
If you don't care about the changes outside of librabbitmq/, and you
discard the changes to code that wasn't generated back then but is now,
it looks to me like there are only a couple of changes relevant (to
librabbitmq/amqp_socket.c and librabbitmq/codegen.py).

Perhaps we should be gratified that people are still running the 1.7.2
broker in production.  But I'd strongly recommend you upgrade at the
earliest opportunity, both for the many enhancements and for the bug
fixes.  You do know that old 0-8 clients can still talk to the latest
versions of the broker, so you don't have to upgrade your whole AMQP 0-8
infrastructure at once?

David
