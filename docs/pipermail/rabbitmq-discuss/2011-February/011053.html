<PRE>Hi,

Does this version include the new &quot;interleaved message delivery&quot; stuff for
basic.deliver?

Thanks,
--Robin

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.3.1.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This release fixes a small number of bugs, in particular one serious
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bug in 2.3.0 which could lead to queue processes crashing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a result of the severity of the bug that's been fixed, we do not
</I>&gt;<i> advise anyone to use 2.3.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bug fixed is a race condition that can cause any queue to violate an
</I>&gt;<i> enforced invariant of the queue during an AMQP transaction commit. If
</I>&gt;<i> the invariant is violated, then the queue will crash instantly, losing
</I>&gt;<i> all non-persisted messages within the queue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bug was introduced in the process of fixing another bug - a bug that
</I>&gt;<i> had existed since the 2.0.0 release, and which could lead, in the event
</I>&gt;<i> of a crash, to more persistent messages being lost than should be. To
</I>&gt;<i> explain that a little further: persistent messages are not written to
</I>&gt;<i> disk immediately because there may be opportunities to optimise out the
</I>&gt;<i> write completely, and additionally it is not performant to issue lots of
</I>&gt;<i> tiny I/O write operations. Consequently, there are various caches, and
</I>&gt;<i> timeouts which ensure that messages that are being written to disk are
</I>&gt;<i> done so promptly enough but also efficiently enough. The bug found was
</I>&gt;<i> that one of the timers related to this process was not being reset
</I>&gt;<i> correctly. As a result, a long period of time could occur before
</I>&gt;<i> messages were pushed out to disk in some cases, leading to a bigger
</I>&gt;<i> window for messages to be potentially lost in. This would affect not
</I>&gt;<i> just how messages are pushed to disk in the case of memory pressure, but
</I>&gt;<i> also latency of transaction commits, and probably some scenarios too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fixing this bug, the critical bug discovered in 2.3.0 was
</I>&gt;<i> accidentally introduced. Both bugs do not exist in 2.3.1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By being a race condition, it managed to not get triggered in testing.
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed even now, knowing where the bug lies, I have not been able to
</I>&gt;<i> trigger it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that sheds some light on the situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
