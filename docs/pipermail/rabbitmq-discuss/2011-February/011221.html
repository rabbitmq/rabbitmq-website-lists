    Although I can't provide a direct answer to your question, I would
say that at least from a security point of view, exchanges are very
useful as they allow me to explicitly allow / disallow which users can
either post or consume messages. (It is impossible to use ACL's on
routing keys.)

    For example if I would to replace D-Bus with AMQP, only anyone
could subscribe to the &quot;os.control&quot; exchange (both the control daemon
but also interested users / applications), but only an OS operator
could publish messages to that particular exchange to for example
reboot the OS.

    Further more, exchanges determine how routing is done -- some
based on the routing key, others based on headers -- and in recent
versions of RabbitMQ (2.2.0?) you can bind exchanges to exchanges,
thus offering you a poor-man AND / OR operators.

    I hope others could provide you with a better / more to the point answer.

    Ciprian.
