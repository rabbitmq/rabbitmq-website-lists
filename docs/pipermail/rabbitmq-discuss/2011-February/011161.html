<PRE>Hi, Cristoforo...

&gt;<i> I'm facing into a scenario where I need to remotely destroy, or unbind
</I>&gt;<i> a subscriber from a queue or even close an exchange. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> taking into account a third-party authentication server (I call it
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Auth Server&quot;) wich gives the subscriber some access rights to use
</I>&gt;<i> with RabbitMQ in order to connect to the broker; the policy may
</I>&gt;<i> require that the subscriber can be connected with the broker for only
</I>&gt;<i> one hour, after that it should be stopped. Here is my question. Is
</I>&gt;<i> there any possibility for the Auth Server to remotely destroy a queue,
</I>&gt;<i> an exchange or a channel on the RabbitMQ server? Thanks in advance for
</I>&gt;<i> any response.
</I>

Assuming I'm following you correctly, and that this third party entity
you're building that you want to handle the cleaning up of bindings,
queues, exchanges, etc. is itself a Rabbit client and has connected to
the broker with suitable permissions, you should be able to do such
things.

Check out our AMQP quick reference at:

<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-quickref.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-quickref.html</A>

Methods you're likely to find of interest are queue.unbind,
exchange.unbind, queue.delete and exchange.delete.  You'll likely find
invoking them to be fairly straightforward (IIRC you're a user of the
.NET client?).  Be sure to check the documentation carefully to make
sure a given teardown method tears down all you expect and not more
(for example queue.delete cancels all consumers on the queue in
question).

Best regards,
Jerry
</PRE>
