Not really. I ended up doing a really hacky workaround where I created a
different exchange for each node.js client and published the messages on the
appropriate exchange. This is not really satisfactory, though, because
ultimately I want to add new consumers for these messages and would like
them to only have to deal with one exchange.

Oh, and instead of this:
&gt;<i> Hope someone can tell me what is going on here. a1 is a web app and the
</I>&gt;<i> first instance of it is on my local machine, and a2 represents me trying
</I>to
&gt;<i> deploy this app in a production environment.
</I>...i meant to say:

a1 is a web app, and the first instance of it is on my local machine; the
second is me trying to deploy this app in a production environment.
