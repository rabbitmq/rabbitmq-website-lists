Hi,

When RabbitMQ is using more memory than it should,
to avoid crashing, it stops accepting new messages.

In AMQP publishing messages is asynchronous, and
it's illegal to 'reject' a published message.

Instead, when RabbitMQ is under a memory pressure
it stops receiving data from tcp connections that try to
do 'basic_publish'.

That's what the 'blocked' connection state means.

It's perfectly legal to open second connection and
consume messages using it as long as it doesn't do 'basic_publish'.

Please check for memory alerts in your RabbitMQ logs,
check if memory watermark is being set properly
and if you have enough memory for your Rabbit.

Cheers,
  Marek
