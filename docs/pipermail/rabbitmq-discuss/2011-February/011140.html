Great! Please do! You're quite right about the lack of documentation -
entirely my fault :-)

Hm, sort of. It's an experiment probably not worth continuing with. Both
librabbitmq's clunkiness and some misdesign entirely blamable on rais itself
led to it being more trouble than it was worth. The idea was to have a
little local relay node on a client machine that would provide a staging
area for messages on their way in and out - a kind of responsibility store,
if you like, that would give &quot;reliable/at-most-once&quot; delivery and
deduplication semantics on top of a remote RabbitMQ. It turned out that
programming in C in that style was a royal pain in the behind. Much better
to use ucontext_t or other approaches.

Regards,
  Tony
