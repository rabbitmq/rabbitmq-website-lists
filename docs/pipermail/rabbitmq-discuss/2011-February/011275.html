<PRE>&gt;<i> I know, but the C++ client is not built by us - it's a community project.
</I>
Yes, and while I appreciate that fact, there's probably a big market out there for a &quot;properly&quot; supported C++ client.

This seems to be a bit of a blind spot for a lot of projects which begin life on linux platforms - here's a huge windows base out there (as you recognise with your .NET client) for whom ruby, python, perl etc are anathema, and they would love to use the tools that are out there but can't.

It's also something I'm mildly concerned about with RabbitMQ's reliance on Erlang/OTP - where is the 64 bit windows OTP?
