Hi alex, 

That problem is solved now.

[
    {mnesia, [{dump_log_write_threshold, 1000}]},
    {rabbit, [{vm_memory_high_watermark,  2.0}]}
]
.

This is our config file. The problem was that we did not add the . (dot) at the end of the config file.

Now I sent 80000 messages of size 1933 bytes from producer to the broker.
The consumer receives 76000 at one run , 68000 at another run. 
There is a drop of messages.  

We are using amq.topic mode. Please help us how to solve the message dropping problem. 

Thanks and Regards,

Hi alex,

We are now trying to sent messages from one producer to the exchange and a consumer takes that message from the queue binded to that exchange.

In the producer side :
-------------------------

10 threads send messages continuosly

In the receiver side 
----------------------

One thread receives all messages.

we used the default configuration of rabbitmq-server and start the test.

In the logs it has printed saying 1638MB of memory is used.

After some time, the server runs out of memory and says Erlang has closed.
We don t know how to increase the size from 1638 MB.

we tried defining a new config file but the rabbitmq server is not recognizing it even though we specified the path in the rabbitmq-server file.



Thanks and Regards,
