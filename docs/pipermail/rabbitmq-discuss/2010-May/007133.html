&gt;<i> I would differ with this slightly. Obviously if you need a production

</I>&gt;<i> to decide based on what features you need and whether/how they are exposed
</I>&gt;<i> by the various implementations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand if you're interest does lie in the specification, the 1-0
</I>&gt;<i> document is specifically intended *not* to require any knowledge of prior
</I>&gt;<i> versions to comprehend, and in some cases familiarity with older versions
</I>&gt;<i> can even result in some confusion, although Michael's unofficial guide
</I>&gt;<i> certainly helps with that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Either way, we could definitely use feedback from people who are reading
</I>&gt;<i> the 1-0 version of the document with fresh eyes that are not weighed down by
</I>&gt;<i> the baggage from earlier versions of the spec. So if you have a few hours to
</I>&gt;<i> spare, any comments would be greatly appreciated, although due to the lack
</I>&gt;<i> of production ready implementations, this may be as much for the benefit of
</I>&gt;<i> the working group as it is for you in the short term.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>my interest in amqp comes has more than one aspect:
a) develop one particular app for production
b) my general interest in distributed programming (once used to work with
CORBA, and implemented part of the in-house orb)
c) write amqp smalltalk client mapping as my graduate thesis at college
during this summer/autumn

a) would probably require 0.x version but potential customer has lost
interest, at least in short term. Though, it would be very nice if viable
1.0 server implementation would exist somewhere around end of this year.

For b) and c) 1.0 seems to be a better choice, so I guess I will start with
it.  But I am afraid I will start reading into it more seriously in late
june, which might be a bit late for your needs, but, well better ever then
never :)

Thanks to all for advices.
