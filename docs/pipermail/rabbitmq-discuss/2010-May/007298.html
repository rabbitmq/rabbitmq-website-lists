<PRE>Thanks Matthew. I'll proceed with 0-9-1 support intact.

I'll wait to see how the 1-0 spec progresses before trying to get my  
head around that.

Regards,

Chris

</I>&gt;<i> 0-9-1 is really a clarification of 0-8 and in nearly all cases  
</I>&gt;<i> where 0-8
</I>&gt;<i> is more ambiguous than 0-9-1, we implement the semantics of 0-9-1.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, the impact to client libraries to move to 0-9-1 should  
</I>&gt;<i> not be
</I>&gt;<i> a huge amount of work - obviously all our client libraries will be  
</I>&gt;<i> 0-9-1
</I>&gt;<i> ready, and it sounds like the Ruby client is as well (David -  
</I>&gt;<i> please do
</I>&gt;<i> *not* drop support for 0-9-1!). There's also an arguement for saying
</I>&gt;<i> that old, likely buggy, and unmaintained clients which are  
</I>&gt;<i> currently 0-8
</I>&gt;<i> only will either die or be rewritten to support 0-9-1 - that is a good
</I>&gt;<i> outcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, if you, as users of Rabbit and client libraries,  
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on a 0-8 client, and moving to 0-9-1 is going to be a  
</I>&gt;<i> massive
</I>&gt;<i> issue for you, please let us know - we don't want to cause problems  
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> people, and certainly don't want to alienate users or the many many
</I>&gt;<i> members of this community who have contributed their time, effort and
</I>&gt;<i> coding prowess. That said, there is an attraction to forcing some  
</I>&gt;<i> of the
</I>&gt;<i> client libraries to receive some attention - for example a number  
</I>&gt;<i> of our
</I>&gt;<i> users run into issues because the particular client library they're
</I>&gt;<i> using still doesn't support channel.flow. It would definitely be a  
</I>&gt;<i> good
</I>&gt;<i> thing if moving to 0-9-1 and dropping support for 0-8 would cause  
</I>&gt;<i> those
</I>&gt;<i> libraries to be fixed up, by more than just a change to the version in
</I>&gt;<i> the protocol negotiation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As always, your comments and thoughts are very valuable to us.
