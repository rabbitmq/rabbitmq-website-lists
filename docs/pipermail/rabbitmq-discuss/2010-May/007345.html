<PRE>Hi Emile

Thanks very much for the reply.  Just to let you know we are using rabbit 1.7.1.  Anyway in response to your questions if I run the following command on one of our VM's:-

./rabbitmqctl status

I get the response:-

Status of node <A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at ttraflonrh320</A> ...
[{running_applications,[{rabbitmq_bql,&quot;RabbitMQ Broker Query Language&quot;,&quot;0.01&quot;},
                        {amqp_client,&quot;RabbitMQ AMQP Client&quot;,&quot;0.0.0&quot;},
                        {rabbit,&quot;RabbitMQ&quot;,&quot;1.7.1&quot;},
                        {os_mon,&quot;CPO  CXC 138 46&quot;,&quot;2.1.8&quot;},
                        {sasl,&quot;SASL  CXC 138 11&quot;,&quot;2.1.5.4&quot;},
                        {rfc4627_jsonrpc,&quot;JSON RPC Service&quot;,&quot;0.01&quot;},
                        {mnesia,&quot;MNESIA  CXC 138 12&quot;,&quot;4.4.7&quot;},
                        {stdlib,&quot;ERTS  CXC 138 10&quot;,&quot;1.15.5&quot;},
                        {kernel,&quot;ERTS  CXC 138 10&quot;,&quot;2.12.5&quot;}]},
  {nodes,[<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at ttraflonrh320</A>]},
  {running_nodes,[<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at ttraflonrhtest</A><A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">,rabbit at ttraflonrh324</A>,
                 <A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at ttraflonrh334</A><A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">,rabbit at ttraflonrh326</A>,
                 <A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at ttraflonrh331</A><A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">,rabbit at ttraflonrh320</A>]}]

Which strikes me a slightly weird as the running nodes do not match up with the nodes.  Unfortunately I have not been able to determine from the documentation what this means.

In answer to your other question as to the contents of our cluster_nodes.config file.  I have searched the entire machine and we do not have this file.  Ben Hood from LShift suggested that the behaviour we are seeing may be slightly strange and to post the initial question on the mailing list.

Any extra help would be greatly appreciated.  We were thinking that it would be ok to ensure the cookie is different on all the machines, but now we are slightly concerned about how we got in this situation in the first place and are worried that there is something wrong with our template installation.

What started this investigation off for us in the first place was that we were noticing that when running these environments in parallel our clients which receive messages off rabbit queues were receiving them from different hosts.

Thanks again.

Keith
