<PRE>I put together the attached sample code (using the .NET API).

 &lt;&lt;Program.cs&gt;&gt; 
I put 10 messages on a queue, and then I try to read those same messages
off of the queue.

The first call to BasicGet returns the first message, but the second
call to BasicGet never returns.  If I reduce the size of the of the
messages down to 4096 bytes (instead of 2097152), then the BasicGet
calls work as expected.

Is there a size limitation on on messages that can be put on the queue?
