<PRE>Hi Colin,

&gt;<i> In regards to the once-and-only-once discussion below:

</I>&gt;<i> (there are id's for both the client &amp; server messages, both incremented for

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FIX employs an optimistic delivery protocol, i.e., assume that it was

</I>
We use sequence numbers for flow control, this is separate from the
tag used for de-duplication.

&gt;<i> I do agree, if a message is sent, then an ack is waited for, sending an ack
</I>&gt;<i> of ack seems a little over kill to me.&#160; Perhaps it's time for me to read the
</I>&gt;<i> whole spec again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As I (and Rafi who seems to have simultaneously said much the same
thing :-) ) have said, this is not required behaviour.  You can
*choose* to behave in this way, but for the use case above I very much
doubt that is how you would want to behave.  The receiver can
periodically notify the sender as to the high-watermark of messages
that it considers settled - this will give the same behaviour as
above.

Hope this helps,
Rob
