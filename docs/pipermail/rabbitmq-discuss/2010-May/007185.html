</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On a more serious note, my main concerns are mainly around complexity,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding complexity. IMO a large part of the complexity in the spec.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delivery guarantee. AIUI the way the spec. implements this guarantee is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something like the following when transferring a message from A to B:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a) message to be sent from A--&gt;B
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b) ack sent back from B--&gt;A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> c) &quot;ack of ack&quot; sent from A--&gt;B - now the delivery tag can be removed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the senders cache
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> Just to be clear, while this behaviour is permitted under the spec, it
</I>&gt;<i> is not mandated that every message exchange follows this pattern.
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly the protocol will support different reliability guarantees
</I>&gt;<i> agreed at the link level (at most once, at least once, exactly once,
</I>&gt;<i> etc) which will allow simpler patterns where the extra guarantees are
</I>&gt;<i> not required.
</I>I believe you can use a simpler pattern, but still retain the once and 
only once guarantee.

This is how we do it in HornetQ to give us once and only once when 
bridging messages from one server A to another B.

The sender doesn't maintain any delivery map at all. Each message has a 
de-duplication-id which can either be set by the client when the message 
was originally sent, or can be set by the server and derived from the 
message and node id of the sender.

Since the id can be derived from the message, or is already persisted as 
part of the message there's no need to persist it separately or maintain 
a map on the client side.

The receiving node B simply maintains a circular cache of received ids 
(which is optionally persisted). If B sees the same de-duplication-id 
more than once it simply ignores the message.

After failure, the sender can just carry on sending any unacked messages 
as normal and the server will reject any dups.

B sends acks back to A asynchronously in a different stream (so 
everything is pipelined for performance). When A receives the ack, then 
the message can be removed from storage.

This gives us once and only once without having the c) interaction above.

I believe it this gives us one less transfer on the wire, but more 
importantly one less write to storage - on the sender side.

I can see that your scheme accomplishes the same goal, but it seems 
somewhat more complex, unless I am missing something (quite possible ;) )
