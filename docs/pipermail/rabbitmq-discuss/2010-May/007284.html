No matter. Grep will do for now.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. What might &quot;writer,send_failed,badarg&quot; as the termination reason

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Prior the the shutdown, what is the meaning of:

</I>&gt;<i> We think that you have heartbeats turned on. Heartbeats are quite
</I>&gt;<i> unreliable under Windows, especially when the machine is loaded, because
</I>&gt;<i> of schedular issues. Try turning heartbeats off (has to be done from

</I>&gt;<i> heartbeats by default. 1.6.0 is quite old - we'd recommend you upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> to 1.7.2 if you can.
</I>
I looked at the apps a bit further, and they are using 1.5.4 of the
Java client, and the heartbeat is left at the default of 3 seconds.
Unfortuantely we need to rebuild the app to change the heartbeat, as
we didn't expose it as a property.

The trunk versions of the apps have been updated to 1.7.0, and we plan
to upgrade the broker soon.

The system is running smoothly again, so in the short term we'll:
- monitor for the next few days
- patch our apps to disable heartbeat if we hit problems again
- upgrade the clients and broker if this still is unstable.

Thanks for the help,

Jason
