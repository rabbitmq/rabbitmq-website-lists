</I>&gt;&gt;<i> G'day.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am looking at deploying RabbitMQ to provide messaging services inside, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between, our two sites using both the AMQP and STOMP interfaces.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As far as I can tell we have two choices for deploying this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Use an Erlang cluster over the WAN, as a single instance of RabbitMQ
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Use the 'shovel' extension to push messages between two distinct RabbitMQ
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     clusters, one at each site.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only real discussion I can find about this is from 35 weeks ago, where the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comment was that using shovel might better handle a situation where the WAN
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was down, but that it was not production ready.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an aside, Matthew now tells me that the shovel is &quot;production ready&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> although at the moment it still requires compiling the broker, Erlang 
</I>&gt;<i> client and shovel from source.
</I>
At least help from another user here, and a bunch of struggling, got me as far
as building rabbitmq-stomp from source to a Debian package, so building those
wouldn't be too terrible, if needs be.

I figured in most of a year things might have moved on; is it still likely
that shovel will avoid losing messages across a WAN split where Erlang
clustering would lose them?

&gt;&gt;<i> My impression is that, generally speaking, we are likely to be best served by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using an Erlang cluster over the network: the WAN is fairly reliable, and will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> soon have two redundant paths, further reducing the risk of a split cluster.
</I>
[...]

&gt;&gt;<i> Erlang and/or RabbitMQ will ensure that only one copy of a message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> traverses the WAN, even if there are multiple recipients at the remote
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not in 1.7.2. Versions of this optimisation existed in previous versions
</I>&gt;<i> of RabbitMQ, but have since been disabled since they broke some ordering
</I>&gt;<i> guarantees.
</I>
OK.  Given I do value stability and correctness over performance, in 1.7.2 is
this going to be one copy per subscriber on the remote node over the WAN?

&gt;<i> There's a new, correct, version of this optimisation on branch bug19844 
</I>&gt;<i> in Mercurial (so, err, requiring you to compile from source again). It's 
</I>&gt;<i> in a fairly reasonable state and hopefully should get merged into the 
</I>&gt;<i> default branch soon and thus find its way into the next release. You are 
</I>&gt;<i> very welcome, and indeed encouraged, to test it out before that happens.
</I>
Depending, I might well do so &#8212; but given we are testing the message queue
system, we are very unlikely to actually find problems with this.

[...]

&gt;&gt;<i> Further, is there anything useful that I can read about Erlang and RabbitMQ
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WAN clustering?  My research, to date, has not given me much to learn from,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which makes me wonder what hidden complexity I might be risking...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I assume you've seen the clustering guide:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html</A>
</I>
Yup.  Very useful, and a good guide.  I felt quite comfortable that it covered
pretty much everything RabbitMQ-specific I needed to know about clustering.

&gt;<i> (but that's pretty basic, I admit), and the Distributed Erlang manpage:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html">http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/distributed.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> (or at least the section on security).
</I>
Yup.  Again, useful, though I need to invest a little more time in
understanding how best to set and share the cookie if I do go down this path.

What I am missing is not so much a reference or admin guide, but a practical
implementation FAQ:

I want to understand better what, for example, high latency or low bandwidth
links mean in the context of a WAN Erlang cluster: if latency gets high
enough, do messages time-out and get retried?  Is this congestion-controlled?

When the Erlang messages start to back up, do they take down the cluster?

I *think* the answer is that Erlang is good about this, and time-out control
is application specific, but there doesn't seem to be a good guide to what
there is that I *should* be worrying about.

&gt;<i> Yes, we could probably do with more documentation...
</I>
The RabbitMQ documentation is actually pretty darn good, as far as I am
concerned; a large part of why your implementation was the one I chose to
trial was that it was easy to understand from what you have written.

Now, the Erlang platform, that could do with a guidebook in addition to the
reference manual. :)
