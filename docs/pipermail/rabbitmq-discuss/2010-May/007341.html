<PRE>Our C++ programmers were wondering when they might be able to catch up to the Java side of things and start using RabbitMQ? :)

I'm using it with my vcloud session manager (which works great, BTW! ;) to do non-sticky tcServer sessions and we're also basing our AS/400 trigger program workers on RabbitMQ. The C++ guys want to integrate directly with the server but they're running VisualStudio 2003 and boost/C++, not .NET. They've tried various AMQP clients that have C++ bindings, but almost all of them are 0-9 clients and won't connect to our 1.7.2 RabbitMQ server. I'm going to install the STOMP plugin so they can try that. 

Is there some kind of timeframe I can give that would offer some assurances that they won't have to just give up on using RabbitMQ and find some awkward workaround? Or is there some production-capable C++ binding I'm not aware of that they could just incorporate right away? Keep in mind they've never done this kind of programming before so the paradigm shift is going to be enough to wrestle with. I'd rather not inflict partially-implemented solutions on them that might give them a bad rash and cause them to swear at me. :)
