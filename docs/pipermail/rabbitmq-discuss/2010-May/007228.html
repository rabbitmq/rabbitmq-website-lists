Would you mind sharing exactly what documentation and example scripts
you were following? We should get those fixed.

One other thing that came to mind while looking at the RA: the
recommended minimum start timeout of 600s seems a bit excessive.
Starting with Pacemaker 1.0.8 the crm shell will warn if the
configuration provides for shorter timeouts than the RA recommends. Sure
you need a 10-minute start timeout?

Cheers,
Florian
