Just to clarify - my comments were under the assumption that you
wanted to run something in production some time soon.

I fully agree with Rafi that we welcome comments on 1-0, and questions
are good too.  If you read the spec and do not understand something,
let us know.  That way it can be clarirfied.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand if you're interest does lie in the specification, the 1-0

</I>&gt;<i> can even result in some confusion, although Michael's unofficial guide
</I>&gt;<i> certainly helps with that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Either way, we could definitely use feedback from people who are reading the
</I>&gt;<i> 1-0 version of the document with fresh eyes that are not weighed down by the
</I>&gt;<i> baggage from earlier versions of the spec. So if you have a few hours to
</I>&gt;<i> spare, any comments would be greatly appreciated, although due to the lack
</I>&gt;<i> of production ready implementations, this may be as much for the benefit of
</I>&gt;<i> the working group as it is for you in the short term.
