<PRE>Hi, 

 

            We are evaluating rabbitMQ's performance for our use cases.
We are using rabbitmq-server-1.7.2  ( downloaded under the heading
generic Linux ). Since our linux machine RAM is 8 GB and it is a 32 bit
machine. RabbitMQ takes 1638 MB and it prints it in the logs. How ever
when I want to increase the size by using   {rabbit,
[{vm_memory_high_watermark,  2.0}]} the rabbitMQ server is not
recognizing this configuration change  at all. 

 

I did a change in the rabbitmq-server file pointing
CONFIG_FILE=/home/ppoker/MessagingPOC/RabbitMQ/rabbitmq
rabbitmq.config is my file name.

 

Earlier, in the default run. You have mentioned that the default config
file for generic unix will be in /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config. I did
not get this file there.

 

Where am I going wrong ? 

Please suggest me a solution and a sample copy of the rabbitmq.config
file.

Also please clear us about the difference between rabbitmq.conf file and
rabbitmq.config file.

 

 

Thanks and Regards,
