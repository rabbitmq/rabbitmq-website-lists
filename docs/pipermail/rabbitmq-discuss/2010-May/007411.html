Hi Ryan.

There certainly should not be a problem with messages of that size. I 
don't have a .NET development environment to hand right now but as a 
sanity check I converted your test program into Python and it worked 
fine (against 1.7.2).

I'll poke about in the .NET client next week - in the meantime can you 
confirm the client and server versions you're using?

Cheers, Simon
