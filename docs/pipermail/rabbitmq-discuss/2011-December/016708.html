So it would be cool if this were to land sometime soon. In the
meantime, I have been able to use a workaround of sorts. So by just
letting AD users get the innocuous monitoring role, they can see
everything that is &quot;going on&quot; without be able to do anything like
reading, writing, adding, deleting, binding or purging - it is purely
statistical. All other functions can be executed by users defined in
the internal DB.

Whilst not being as flexible and fully fledged as a full AD solution,
it does add some value right now, because people can use the
management UI as a heads up display, e.g. to see when things get
wedged.

For anybody that is interested, here is the
/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config I used:

[

 %% Enable SSL support for the Management Web UI
 %% Note that you have to supply the CA cert, the server's cert and
the server's private key yourself

  {rabbitmq_mochiweb,
  [{listeners, [{'*',  [{port,     55670}]},
                {mgmt, [{port,     55672},
                        {ssl,      true},
			{ssl_opts, [{cacertfile, &quot;/path/to/cacert.pem&quot;},
                                    {certfile,   &quot;/path/to/cert.pem&quot;},
                                    {keyfile,    &quot;/path/to/key.pem&quot;}]}
                       ]}
               ]}
  ]},

 %% Enable both the internal user DB and LDAP
 %% Make sure that the internal store has precedence, otherwise
internal users may not be able to use the management UI

 {rabbit, [ {auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_internal,
rabbit_auth_backend_ldap]} ]  },

 %% Configure the connection to AD

 {rabbitmq_auth_backend_ldap,
 [
   %% The main AD server

   {servers,               [&quot;172.20.3.21&quot;]},

   %% This is the user that is logging in using their AD creds.

   {user_dn_pattern,       &quot;${username}@ACMECORP&quot;},

   %% The LDAP plugin in Rabbit 2.7.0 doesn't appear to play as well
as it does with other LDAP implementations,
   %% so the appropriate tickets have been raised at VMWare to get
this fixed for a future version.

   {resource_access_query,
     {for, [ {permission, configure, {constant, false}},
             {permission, read, {constant, false}},
             {permission, write, {constant, false}} ]}
   },

   %% Only allow LDAP users to monitor what is going on

   {tag_queries,           [{monitoring, {constant, true}}]},

   %% Self-explanatory
	
   {use_ssl,               false},
   {port,                  389},
   {log,                   false} ] }
].
