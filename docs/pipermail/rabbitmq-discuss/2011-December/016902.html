<PRE>Yes, this is a reasonable approach. Shovel / federation both chain acks 
and confirms together, so that one broker or the other is always 
responsible for the message.

As to your second question: the real answer is likely to be specific to 
your application. But messages should not remain unconfirmed 
indefinitely. The only reason your client might not receive a (n)ack for 
any given message would be if the connection goes down.

Cheers, Simon
