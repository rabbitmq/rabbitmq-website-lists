<PRE>Many thanks for this Simon. I will try with two disk nodes and test simultaneous failure of both.

Dan.

Yes, they can. You can have as many disc nodes as you like. However...

 &gt; My question is, is there a way of changing this configuration so that it  &gt; does not matter which order the nodes come back up after a total outage?

...it can still matter which order the nodes come back. If you shut down in an orderly way and A goes down after B, A will need to come back up again first (since things maybe have happened in the cluster while B was down).

I'm not sure what happens in the event of several nodes simultaneously losing power though.

&gt;<i> We cannot rely on
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that the disk node will be usable after such a failure.
</I>
Absolutely. You need more than one then :)

Cheers, Simon
