<PRE>Hi Adam,

Sorry for the late response.

&gt;<i> For example, say I have a &quot;worker pool&quot; with 40
</I>&gt;<i> QueueingConsumers (ie 40 separate channels).  I believe it is
</I>&gt;<i> completely fine to keep these channels (and underlying connection(s))
</I>&gt;<i> open indefinitely, is this correct? 
</I>
It probably is.  Channels don't require a lot of resources to keep
running, on neither the server nor the client side.

&gt;<i> In this long-running situation,
</I>&gt;<i> what is the optimal number of underlying connections for these 40
</I>&gt;<i> channels? 
</I>
We did some tests a while ago and we couldn't find much difference in
throughput between running multiple channels on a single connection or on
multiple connections.

Note that connections use up the limited file descriptors, so you
wouldn't be able to run a very large number of connections at the same
time.

I suspect it's better (and easier) to have all the channels running on
the same connection.

Hope this clears things up.

Cheers,
Alex
