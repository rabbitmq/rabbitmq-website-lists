As I said, the problem I identified has been around for more than three 
years.

The likely trigger is some obscure condition in the network stack. So it 
is quite conceivable that the move to a different server made this 
happen with a much higher probability than before. For example, it looks 
like you are now using IPv6 - was that the case before the move too?
