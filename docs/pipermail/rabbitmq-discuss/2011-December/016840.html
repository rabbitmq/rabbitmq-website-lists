<PRE>Hmm. I can't really say anything from your description - can you post 
the logs somewhere? It's possible that your definition of &quot;nothing 
unusual in the logs&quot; differs from mine.

And when you say that &quot;the server refused attempts to connect&quot;, what 
exactly do you mean. You say that a TCP connection *could* be 
established - so does your client hang during AMQP handshaking? 
Disconnect? Something else?

Cheers, Simon

</I>&gt;<i> After a couple of such failures I tried to downgrade to 2.6.1, but the
