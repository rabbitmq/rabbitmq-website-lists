<PRE>Dear John,

Our work was, in part, prompted by your questions.  Thank you.

I think we will be able to manage two of your three issues.  The 'multiple
replies' scheme is tricky, and we do not intend to try this straight away.
There are many problems with it which could result in an ugly interface.
Is there any reason why a large reply would not be adequate?

</I>&gt;<i> - the fact that the routing key is a final attribute of the class (which makes me create multiple clients when using several routing keys)
