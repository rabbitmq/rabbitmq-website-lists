<PRE>We did not switch to IPv6 intentionally. I didn't even notice this
until some time ago, trying to find the cause of those troubles. I do
not think, though, that this is relevant, because the problem
persisted even when Rabbit was configured to work with v4 only.

I have installed that file and restarted Rabbit. Also, I asked the
developers whether they can stress-test the server. I will let you
know as soon as possible.

Thanks!
