<PRE>I'm just guessing, but there is this on the pacemaker page:

&gt;<i> The main trick to HA Rabbit is to ensure that when the passive node becomes
</I>&gt;<i> the active node, it must have the same node-name as the failed node. It must
</I>&gt;<i> also have read and write access to the files in the shared storage, and if
</I>&gt;<i> it's going to also be part of a cluster then it must also have the same
</I>&gt;<i> Erlang cookie.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The server runs as the user rabbitmq which is a member of the group
</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmq. You must ensure that this user and group have the same UIDs and
</I>&gt;<i> GIDs on both nodes. You can probably save yourself some time by explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> creating the rabbitmq user and group with the same UID and GID on all nodes
</I>&gt;<i> before installing the RabbitMQ server at all. If necessary, edit/etc/passwd
</I>&gt;<i> and /etc/group on both nodes, and then reinstall the RabbitMQ server to
</I>&gt;<i> ensure all necessary files are owned by the correct user and group.
</I>
That could explain why the slave doesn't 'promote' properly.

However, that said, there is also this:

&gt;<i> This page documents a legacy technique for achieving active-passive high
</I>&gt;<i> availability with RabbitMQ. Active-active mirrored queues are easier to use
</I>&gt;<i> and do not impose a delay at failover.
</I>
So, yes, pacemaker HA is a 'legacy' technique though it should still work
and it is possible that in certain circumstances it may offer advantages.
However, closely coupled rabbit nodes in a cluster with mirrored queues
offers the best HA solution so far.
