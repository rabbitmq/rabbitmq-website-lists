<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I am having an issue where I am pushing data to queues and after some point, a particular queue stop batching the in-memory data to disk, it appears.  In the included data below, the queue in question is queue E.  As seen from the backing_queue_status, queue E has {ram_msg_count,396922} and {persistent_count,2572735}.  In the case of queue C, which contains more messages, none of them are residing in memory.

I have a rabbitmq.config as follows:
[
  {rabbit, [ {hipe_compile, false},
             {collect_statistics_interval, 10000},
             {disk_free_limit, 50000000},
             {tcp_listeners, [5678]}
            ] },
  {rabbitmq_management_agent, [ {force_fine_statistics, false}
                              ] }
].

It appears that at some point the flushing stops and then once the vm_memory_high_watermark is hit, I get a message informing me.

My question is two-fold:
  1) Has this been seen before/is there a solution already out there?
  2) Is there a configuration parameter that tells rabbitmq to write messages immediately to disk instead of buffering to memory first?
