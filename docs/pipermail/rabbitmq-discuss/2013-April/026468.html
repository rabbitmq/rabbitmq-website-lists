I don't know about a show of hands but I strongly suspect more people run RabbitMQ on Linux than Windows. And while we try hard to make Windows a first class citizen in the RabbitMQ world, in the end we do most development on Linux.

But really you should go with what you're most comfortable with.

Cheers, Simon
