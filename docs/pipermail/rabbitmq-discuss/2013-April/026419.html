<PRE>Hi Guys,

We are looking to use RabbitMQ as a messagebus in a scalable application. In order to achieve complete scalability it is important that we can ramp up our RabbitMQ cluster to have more nodes when a performance bottleneck is realised.

I have reviewed the clustering guidelines and understand the queues do not migrate across a cluster when the nodes are being taken down. If a node fails/is taken down then queues for which it maintained will no longer be protected if an HA policy of exactly two nodes is used, until that node is restored that is.

I believe these three questions will further my understanding:

Is there a way to re-nice the queues across the cluster to even out the load?

Is there a way to migrate already existing queues to new nodes as slaves?

If a queue loses a node and a new node is added to the cluster, will the new node join the ha policy for that particular queue?


Thanks in advance.

Chris
