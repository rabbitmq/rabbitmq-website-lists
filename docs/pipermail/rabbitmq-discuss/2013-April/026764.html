I am not a .net expert, but some quick googling suggests that .net has a 
default thread pool with some &quot;interesting&quot; policies on thread creation, 
namely that new threads are only created at a rate of 2Hz. See 
<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6000891.">http://stackoverflow.com/a/6000891.</A> Looks like increasing the *min* 
threads setting would address that.

Matthias.
