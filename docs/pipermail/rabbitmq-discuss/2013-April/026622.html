Queues won't mirror themselves on a new node spontaneously, so the
opportunities for rebalancing is limited to queue creation and node
death at the moment. In the case of an &quot;exactly&quot; policy the list of
candidate nodes is randomised when mirror nodes are picked, so that
offers some opportunity for rebalancing by restarting nodes.

If you want to guarantee that a node is mirrored on a particular new
node then you can use the &quot;nodes&quot; policy and spell out exactly which
nodes the queue should live on.

</I>
The flow-control as implemented by the broker should not depend on the
client library, as it works on the network level. It is possible that
you see old blocked connections in the output of &quot;rabbitmqctl
list_connections&quot;. This problem is not limited to PHP, it is a general
problem that we have not yet found a solution to.
