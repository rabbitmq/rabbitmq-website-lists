<PRE>Hi Jacques,

Have you posted details about this to the mailing list previously? I 
didn't see anything specific from you in the last week or so.

Would you be able to provide logs and/or further information about your 
setup? Obviously we're keen to track down any bugs that cause 
operational issues and resolve them asap.

Cheers,
Tim

</I>&gt;<i>     weeks, as a single instance, without issue) and at the same time
</I>&gt;<i>     beef up the size and redundancy of our farm to 3 machines that
</I>&gt;<i>     were m1.larges.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Old Farm:
</I>&gt;<i>       server1: m1.small, 2.8.5, us-west-1c
</I>&gt;<i>       server2: m1.small, 2.8.5, us-west-1c
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     New Farm:
</I>&gt;<i>       server1: m1.large, 3.0.4, us-west-1a
</I>&gt;<i>       server2: m1.large, 3.0.4, us-west-1c
</I>&gt;<i>       server3: m1.large, 3.0.4, us-west-1c
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Since creating the new server farm though we've had 3 outages. In
</I>&gt;<i>     the first two outages we received a Network Partition Split, and
</I>&gt;<i>     effectively all 3 of the systems decided to run their own queues
</I>&gt;<i>     independently of the other servers. This was the first time we'd
</I>&gt;<i>     ever seen this failure, ever. In the most recent failure we had 2
</I>&gt;<i>     machines split off, and the 3rd rabbitmq service effectively
</I>&gt;<i>     became unresponsive entirely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     For sanity sake, at this point we've backed down to the following
</I>&gt;<i>     configuration:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     New-New Farm:
</I>&gt;<i>       server1: m1.large, 2.8.5, us-west-1c
</I>&gt;<i>       server2: m1.large, 2.8.5, us-west-1a
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Up until recently though I had felt extremely comfortable with
</I>&gt;<i>     RabbitMQ's clustering technology and reliability... now ... not so
</I>&gt;<i>     much. Has anyone else seen similar behaviors? Is it simply due to
</I>&gt;<i>     the fact that we're running cross-zone now in Amazon, or is it
</I>&gt;<i>     more likely the 3 servers that caused the problem? Or the 3.0.x
</I>&gt;<i>     upgrade?
