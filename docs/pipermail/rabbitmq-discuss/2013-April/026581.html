In my case, I am pushing messages across WANs, potentially to different data centers, where some are treated as backups in the case where primaries go down.  So having a list of destinations provides some resiliency in the case of network or hardware failure.  I think in cases like this, operators need some predictability in where the messages are being sent.

</I>&gt;<i> We could do that. But I'd like to see a reason for this feature to exist.
</I>
I agree that is adds complexity to a fairly tight bit of code, hence increases test complexity, imposes an maintenance burden, etc.  So I can certainly understand the reluctance to fold it in.  I am mostly curious if other users have the same set of requirements, or whether instead the source and destination lists are really more used in clustering scenarios.  For all I know, I am abusing the use-case for which the multi-endpoint feature was designed.
