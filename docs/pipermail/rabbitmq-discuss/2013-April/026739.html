<PRE>We would also be interested in knowing this.  I am on a project where we 
use RabbitMQ for most of our messaging.  We also have a third party 
application that is capable of sending JMS messages.  We have tested this 
application with ActiveMQ in the past; however, if we could eliminate the 
need for the ActiveMQ server we would like to do so.  As it is now it 
sounds like we will need to create a bridge application if we need to get 
the messages out of ActiveMQ and into RabbitMQ.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm trying to implement RabbitMQ as the core messaging hub to be used in

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (or something similar)? Please share your experiences. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Install RabbitMQ broker in the intranet zone for all internal apps. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All internal apps use Windows, IIS, .Net stack. We can use the .Net client 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for RabbitMQ and have done some proof-of-concept testing and seems to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working fine. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Install RabbitMQ in the DMZ zone for the external apps such as 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> customer facing web portal (WebLogic, JSF, Oracle) and another vendor app 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (JBoss, Linux and Oracle). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Both of these brokers need to be working in high-availability (HA in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> active/active) mode.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is that the new vendor app that we are trying to plug in here 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (under external apps) provides MQ features using JMS. But since this is a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vendor app, we don't have access to the source code and we cannot make 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes to start using rabbitMQ's Java client for this app. I need to use 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some JMS compliant messaging provider for this app. For instance, I can use 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JBoss MQ or otherwise buy IBM MQ (which could always be done technically 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but it's cost prohibitive for us for now).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm trying to figure out if I can use RabbitMQ as a JMS provider? If I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can do so in a production environment, then we can keep RabbitMQ as the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> core messaging backbone for the firm without having to use a different JMS 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provider. Please share if someone has run into something similar.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thx in advance...
