<PRE>Hi Guys,

We currently have several RabbitMQ servers running on Windows Server 2008 R2. I am proposing the idea that we move over to a linux based platform in order to reduce the storage size of the vm's we are running them in. We are on a hosted platform so every extra GB will cost us more each month. There is resistance to moving over to linux as we have less resource in our technical operations team who know linux. We are traditionally a Microsoft Shop. Our primary platform is written in .Net.

Could I have a show of hands to see who is running Rabbit on Linux and Windows?

If anyone has any good reasons why it would be better to switch to Linux I would be interested in those also.

Thanks in Advance.

Cheers

Chris
