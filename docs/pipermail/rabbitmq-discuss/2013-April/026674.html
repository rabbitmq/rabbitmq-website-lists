Sorry, I didn't mean to say that any of _your_ tools or libraries are 
non-free licensed - only the spec files you publish.


&gt;<i> &gt; Some AMQP-related tools and libraries require the AMQP specs

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BSD-licensed &quot;stripped&quot; specs available, but it seems your derived 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specs are available only licensed with the Debian-incompatible AMQP 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; license :-(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's not entirely true; the extended spec which the RabbitMQ server 
</I>&gt;<i> and official (and many unofficial) clients actually use:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-codegen/file/bbf467c98a21/amqp-rabbitmq-0.9.1.json">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-codegen/file/bbf467c98a21/amqp-rabbitmq-0.9.1.json</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> is BSD-licensed.
</I>
Ah, so it exists, just well hidden.


&gt;<i> However, I notice that the extended spec available from 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/protocol.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/protocol.html</A> is only available in an 
</I>&gt;<i> AMQP-licensed version. Was that what you were talking about?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, we should correct that...
</I>
Yes, please do provide your specs (also the earlier 0-8 one) as XML.

As I wrote in my P.S. I believe to have those specs prepared for you 
already - just needs proof-reading and formal hand-over (from your side 
only: I need no credit, but your license doesn't allow my editing so you 
need to permit me that explicitly, I believe).


&gt;<i> &gt; This issue is pretty serious, it seems: Some existing AMQP-related 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Debian packages are at risk of being removed from Debian if this is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not solved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...but to know how high a priority to give producing such a spec I 
</I>&gt;<i> would need to know if any packages in Debian are currently using the 
</I>&gt;<i> AMQP-licensed extended XML spec. Can you tell me which packages these 
</I>&gt;<i> are? I can't get anything useful out of bugs.debian.org :-(
</I>
Now that I inspected more closely it turns out that only a single 
package - qpid-python - is in violation - and then not your derived 
specs but original ones.

I now filed [bug#706101] - after you posted above, so no wonder you 
couldn't find it - if you tried :-).

Even if not so serious after all, still relevant for my needs: The Perl 
module [AnyEvent::RabbitMQ] ships with your published XML.  I will get 
in touch with the author and suggest using your JSON instead...


Thanks for your swift reply,

 - Jonas
