<PRE>Emile-

Long may be defined as holding tens of millions of messages before the consumers connect to the broker.

You mentioned batching messages.  Is this something that is done by the producer when sending to the broker or a setting within RabbitMQ?

What does RabbitMQ do with the RAM indexes when it is shutdown?  I assume it writes to disk somehow and then reads the indexes back into RAM upon startup.  Does this process only happen upon shutdown and never during execution?  i.e. it never pages the RAM index to disk when out of space?

Can you place an upper limit on &quot;long&quot;?

There is at least one alternative message index storage plugin:
 <A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-toke/">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-toke/</A>

that uses a driver for Tokyo Cabinet:
 <A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/toke/">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/toke/</A>

This plugin has not reached official status:
 <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html</A>

</I>
RabbitMQ is designed to be used as a buffer. The number of messages that
can be buffered is limited by RAM as well as disk. You will need to
provide enough RAM and disk, in line with the number and size of
messages that need to be buffered.

In your case more RAM will allow you to store more messages. If you are
storing lots of small messages and the message index is the dominating
cost then you might also consider batching messages. This will allow you
to store many more messages.
