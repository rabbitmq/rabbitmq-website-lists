&gt;<i> I&#180;m very interested to work on the RabbitMQ development but I need some advices to work on it. For example, I have several questions about:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - Do you are using a Project Management Platform for it?
</I>
Does bugzilla counts as a Project Management Platform?

&gt;<i>  - Do you have a TODO list?
</I>
Does bugzilla counts as a TODO list?

&gt;<i>  - Where is the source repository? If you have a Git mirror, is better
</I>&gt;<i>  for me, although I don&#180;t have trouble with another SVC system.
</I>
The primary source repositories are in Mercurial at
&lt;<A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/</A>&gt;

We also mirror the source code to gitub at
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/rabbitmq">https://github.com/rabbitmq</A>&gt;.

&gt;<i>  - How the new developers can include new documents on the official
</I>&gt;<i>  documentation?
</I>
Some official documentation lives in the source code repos, and we are
happy to take contributions to those docs in the same way as for for
code contributions.

Other official documentation is on the web site.  That content lives in
a private repository (it might not be that way for ever, but there are
reasons it is that way now).  But we're very happy to receive
suggestions and feedback on the web site.

If you want to contribute a new area of documentation, probably the best
way is to put it up on your own web site or blog.  Then, if it makes
sense, we can discuss linking to it from our web site, or even taking it
as a contribution to our web site.

&gt;<i>  - Is there a mentoring mechanism? It's very useful in many open
</I>&gt;<i>  source projects to work aside a experienced developer to learn and to
</I>&gt;<i>  help on the same time
</I>
The RabbitMQ developers all read this mailing list, and we're happy to
take questions here.  It's up to individual developers whether they are
available on other channels.

&gt;<i>  - Is there a Milestone for the 2.3 version?
</I>
We aim for frequent releases, rather than committing to particular
features in particular releases.

&gt;<i>  - Is there a kind of RabbitMQ Developer Summit?
</I>
There hasn't been one yet.

David
