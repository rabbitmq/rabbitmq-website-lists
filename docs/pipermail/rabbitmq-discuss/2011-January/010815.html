<PRE>Hi!

Thanks! Figured something like this was happening.

Yep, that's what I've done to work around the problem, and it seems to be 
working nicely :)

Also, the shovel doesn't seem to recreate the queue it was subscribing to if 
someone deletes it (for example from the management plugin). Should it?
