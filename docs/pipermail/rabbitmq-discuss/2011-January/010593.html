 From the xml spec for auto-delete:
&quot;If set, the queue is deleted when all consumers have finished using it. 
  The last consumer can be cancelled either explicitly or because its 
channel is closed. If there was no consumer ever on the queue, it won't 
be deleted. Applications can explicitly delete auto-delete queues using 
the Delete method as normal.&quot;

&gt;<i> Is using &quot;x-expires&quot; the solution?
</I>
That's one option. Or instead of consuming the message with basic.get 
use basic.consume. Or, as noted above, delete the queue explicitly. With 
x-expires the queue will get deleted eventually even when the reply is 
never read, which may or may not be what you want to happen.

Regards,

Matthias.
