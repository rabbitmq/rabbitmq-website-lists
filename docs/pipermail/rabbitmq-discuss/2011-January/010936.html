I'm sending him a few very simple, special-purpose new queue implementation of mine (rabbit_ram_queue, rabbit_mnesia_queue, and the upcoming rabbit_disk_queue) to try building on. This might be easier for the moment than building on the more complicated rabbit_variable_queue, as Jon is doing now.

It would be great to see a flowchart or something of expected input and output (that's easier to grok than the specs). The specs are helpful, but inadequate to fully understand what's going on because there's no explanation of why something is important or what the reason is of doing it that way. Like sending back a queue length. A doc explaining why that's important and how its used would be better for the developer than trying to follow it all the way through the code and infer it from how its being used.

I do think some documentation beyond what's currently available is needed if there's any expectation of community involvement on this front. New persisters to different backing stores in the future, etc...


Thanks!
