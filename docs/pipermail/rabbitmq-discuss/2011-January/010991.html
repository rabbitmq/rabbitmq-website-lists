</I>&gt;<i> After learning a little bit about AMQP, I concluded that the way to

</I>&gt;<i> with routing keys that indicate the nature of the jobs (let's call it
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;job category&quot;), and having queues that binds to each unique routing
</I>&gt;<i> key, and then having consumers listening on these queues. Multiple
</I>&gt;<i> consumers may listen to the same queue. One job should only be
</I>&gt;<i> performed once system-wide (but is not strictly required as long as
</I>&gt;<i> performance loss is not significant).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My problem is that the number of such &quot;job category&quot; increases
</I>&gt;<i> overtime. E.g. if in the beginning there is only one routing keys such
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;key.stuff.1.A&quot;, overtime keys like &quot;key.stuff.2.A&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;key.stuff.2.B&quot; will start to emerge and eventually such categories
</I>&gt;<i> will reach a large number. However, older categories will eventually
</I>&gt;<i> become obsolete so at a given time I would have at most something like
</I>&gt;<i> 20K different &quot;job categories&quot;. But overtime I would have a LOT of job
</I>&gt;<i> categories. (Lifetime of each &quot;job category&quot; depends and can be
</I>&gt;<i> anything from 1 day to 1 seconds etc..)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm wondering if there is a better way to achieve what I want.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this helps, everything can be transient and non durable. Message
</I>&gt;<i> loss can be tolerated as long as it's not too frequent (e.g. once per
</I>&gt;<i> 10K msgs etc.)
</I>
I'm afraid the problem needs some more explanation.
 - what's wrong with just one fat queue that is shared between workers?
 - are all the tasks going to take roughly the same time?
 - do you need to prioritize the tasks?

Cheers,
