I have to admit I picked CNs for simplicity. The problem with DNs is 
that in general we assume that a username is a string, and can be 
matched as such. As soon as we start using DNs as usernames we have all 
sorts of problems with normalisation. I'm not a real X.509 expert, but 
it doesn't seem like there's a standard normalisation for DNs as 
strings. There are some conventions but they seem to get very hazy once 
you look at issues like escaping.

I'll have a look at how this could be made to work though.

</I>
Hmm. The idea is that SASL EXTERNAL is just another way to authenticate, 
and so it provides a username. I'm not sure a DN-to-username mapping is 
the best way to proceed (suppose you're not storing users in Mnesia - do 
all auth backends need to support such a mapping?)

Cheers, Simon
