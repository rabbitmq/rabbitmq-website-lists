<PRE>Hi Jeff,

&gt;<i> Being new to enterprise mq's, rabbit in particular, is there a definition
</I>&gt;<i> for what an exchange does/is?  The tutorial talks about how use use an
</I>&gt;<i> exchange, and the 3 different types of exchanges but is there more
</I>&gt;<i> conceptually to an exchange than functioning as a logical abstraction for
</I>&gt;<i> segmenting queues and routing per virtual host and/or server?
</I>
An exchange is a message router.  Clients publish messages to exchanges,
and the exchanges route the messages to other exchanges or to queues.
Exchanges do not modify messages and do not store messages.

&gt;<i> From what I've read so far, it doesn't appear to be possible for an exchange
</I>&gt;<i> to span servers, true?
</I>
RabbitMQ nodes can be clustered together to form one large &quot;logical&quot;
broker.  I.e. clients connecting to any node in the cluster will see the
same broker.  So, a client can declare an exchange on one node, another
can publish to the exchange on a different node and the exchange may
route messages to queues declared on yet another node.

&gt;<i> Where do vhosts fit in this model?    server -&gt; vhost -&gt; exchange -&gt; queue?
</I>&gt;<i>  Are they just another logical abstraction that sits on top of exchanges?
</I>&gt;<i>  Is segmenting security the main/only reason?
</I>
Exchanges and queues are declared in the context of vhosts.  So, you can
have two different exchanges with the same name, but in different
vhosts.  It's just a convenient way to group exchanges, queues and
bindings.

&gt;<i> Links are always welcome, I've attempted to search for this information but
</I>&gt;<i> get pages of code examples for results.  So now I'm asking.
</I>
You already know about:
  <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html</A>

The spec is the definitive guide, and the tutorial and the Java Client API
Guide give a hands-on introduction to RabbitMQ.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Alex
