<PRE>Matthew, thanks very much for your comments.  I'll just add a brief top-post
note:

After posting the message below and reading your remarks my thinking is a
better design is to just not depend on messages never being &quot;lost&quot;. (By lost
I was probably thinking once published that they would be consumed in a few
minutes of time regardless of a server failure.)

If we design with the knowledge that a message could be lost and thus be
prepared to publish again when necessary then our messaging system is much
more simple -- and probably less fragile and more reliable as a result.
 Might not work for all businesses, but likely for ours.

We have a database for recording state.  The messaging system is about
changing state in many cases.  So, for important tasks we should be able to
look at the state and say &quot;this was suppose to be done an hour ago, so queue
it again.&quot;  A trickier part is determining if a job was actually lost or is
just still in the queue.

A much more important task is just making sure that clients can publish
messages when needed.

Oh, yes Celery has a lot of nice features that are probably commonly needed
by applications.  I've been testing it for the last week, and even know we
are not a Python shop I suspect we could still use it to fork off other jobs
very easily.

Thanks,

</I>&gt;<i> What
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about for syncing between data centers? Can anyone discuss their HA
</I>&gt;<i> approach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if it differs from the link above?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a couple of other things to mention. One is that work is
</I>&gt;<i> currently been done on active/active HA, but that will provide
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mirrored&quot; queues (think RAID-1) within a cluster only. The other thing
</I>&gt;<i> to mention is the shovel plugin, which can be used for a very
</I>&gt;<i> rudimentary form of federation between different brokers. The main
</I>&gt;<i> limitation with the shovel though is that its configuration can't be
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically changed, so it's only really a sensible solution if you're
</I>&gt;<i> topology is mainly static.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We are evaluating messaging systems and the question of HA has come up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; frequently.  The concern is that some items, once entered onto the queue,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should never be lost -- even if the entire data center goes down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, but is that &quot;lost&quot; as in &quot;provided it's stored on disk, that's
</I>&gt;<i> ok, even if it takes us a month to get the data back off disk&quot;, or is it
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;lost&quot; as it &quot;must always be (near) instantly available&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We are comparing RabbitMQ with writing a system in-house.  The in-house
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; queue system would use a Postgresql table for the queue with replication
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (currently via Slony) for hot-backup (it's not really HA).  We also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; replicate to a secondary data center with the eventual goal of reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fast tip-over between data centers.  We are not in the financial or
</I>&gt;<i> medical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; industry so nobody's life is at risk if we drop a few jobs.  I suspect we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only need to handle three to five million message a day -- nothing too
</I>&gt;<i> big.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  (Oddly, one argument against using RabbitMQ was it was overkill for our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, rather obviously, we're somewhat biased against building message
</I>&gt;<i> brokers on top of databases ;) I guess the things I'd suggest you look
</I>&gt;<i> as is whilst you may be fine with postgres at the moment, what happens
</I>&gt;<i> in a couple of years time? What will your messaging requirements be
</I>&gt;<i> then, and will you have sufficient flexibility in your home-grown system
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to cope with those needs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Postgresql and replication is what we use for application data currently,
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is a familiar technology for us.  Another reason we are considering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; building a custom message queue system is to put more functionality into
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; broker -- such as scheduling and job routing that would be specific to
</I>&gt;<i> our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; business.  And there's fear that nobody knows Erlang if something broke
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we needed to try and resolve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, those are valid concerns. There are ways of extending the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality of Rabbit, for example through exchange types, or even
</I>&gt;<i> custom plugins, but these do normally require writing in Erlang.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My opinion is AMQP is very flexible and we should be able to make it meet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; our needs.  We are not doing anything that unusual.  And I suspect
</I>&gt;<i> building
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something as reliable as RabbitMQ is no easy task -- especially if the
</I>&gt;<i> point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is to make a system more complex than what RabbitMQ provides.
</I>&gt;<i>  Scheduling,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for example, seems like something a simple database table and cron could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solve easily with RabbitMQ.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed - use the right tool for the job etc. Job scheduling and such are
</I>&gt;<i> probably on the boundary of what we consider pure messaging, and so it
</I>&gt;<i> does normally require additional client-side applications to add to
</I>&gt;<i> Rabbit to provide such functionality. You might like to look at celery
</I>&gt;<i> in this space which does job scheduling on top of Rabbit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another argument for a custom broker was to make better use of workers --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i.e. the broker would look at load and other factors when determining
</I>&gt;<i> where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to send jobs.  My feeling here is resources are limited so it's a matter
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; balancing the number and type of consumers with queue load -- and an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; external process can manage starting and stopping consumers easily as
</I>&gt;<i> demand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; profile changes (by looking at queue sizes and rates) without having to
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part of the broker.  Are there common approaches for dynamically
</I>&gt;<i> adjusting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; workers?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect that's something that falls squarely in the remit of tools
</I>&gt;<i> like celery. It's definitely outside the scope of Rabbit itself.
