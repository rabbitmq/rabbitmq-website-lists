This could be handled quite simply with plain jane AMQP, for example
using a direct exchange.

Without wanting to be boring, the spec explains how you would do this
quite well:

The direct exchange type works as follows:

 1. A message queue binds to the exchange using a routing key, K.
 2. A publisher sends the exchange a message with the routing key R.
 3. The message is passed to the message queue if K = R

So you don't need to do this yourself, because this is the type of
thing that the broker will do for you.

BTW, we don't have a C client ATM that you can use out of the box :-(

This is, amongst many other things, on our todo list, but being an
open source outfit, we don't have unlimited resources.

So for anybody interested in a C client, I can only re-iterate how
easy (and rewarding, because you would get a Rabbit T-Shirt) it would
be to write an AMQP client in C  -  see this guide about how to do it

</I>
We do of course, have a Java client that we maintain.

HTH,

Ben
