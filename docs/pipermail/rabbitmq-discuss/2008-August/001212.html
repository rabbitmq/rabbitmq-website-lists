The Erlang client for AMQP, as any other spec compliant client, is
capable of subscribing to a queue in order to be notified of the
delivery of new messages.

If you do intend to use RabbitMQ as your AMQP broker, you will be able
to benefit from the direct Erlang client.

This has the exact same API as the TCP client, the difference is that
it can co-located in the same Erlang VM, thus saving marshalling and
network overhead.

So application code can use the Erlang client in a location
transparent fashion - either remote via TCP or embedded in the same
address space.

HTH,

Ben
