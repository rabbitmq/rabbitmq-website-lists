The server does in fact detects slower consumers and sends them fewer 
messages. This throttling logic is quite crude though and probably too 
coarse-grained for your requirements.

Finer-grained flow control for subscriptions will be possible once we 
implement basic.qos. TBH though I doubt it's going to perform any better 
than basicGet.

</I>&gt;<i>     What CPU utilisation are you seeing?
</I>&gt;<i>

How is that distributed between your Java clients and the RabbitMQ broker?

&gt;<i> I have tried adding more processes to the mix (more queues as well as 
</I>&gt;<i> same queue) but get basically the same results.
</I>
How many connections and channels are your tests using?

Try running the MulticastMain example that ships with the Java client. 
By default, i.e. w/o setting any of the command line flags/options, this 
will create one producer and one consumer in non-auto-ack mode, send 
messages as fast as it can and report on throughput and latency. You can 
use the &quot;-r&quot; flag to limit the sending rate and prevent messages from 
backing up at the broker.

While this test uses basicConsume rather than basicGet, it will 
nevertheless give you a good idea about the performance and, more 
importantly, I can compare the results against what we are seeing on 
some of our test machines.

&gt;<i>     Also, what OS are you on and what version of Erlang/OTP are you running?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am on CentOS 5 running erlang 5.6.3
</I>
Some testing we did in the past indicates that generally a clustered 
broker - with one node per core and smp disabled for the Erlang VM - 
performs significantly better than a single smp-enabled node.


Matthias.
