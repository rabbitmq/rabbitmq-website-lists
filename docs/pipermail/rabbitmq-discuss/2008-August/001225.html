What's wrong with having multiple logical (and thus TCP) connections? 
Does your application depend on having a single logical connection? I'd 
find that surprising given that the connection doesn't feature as a 
logical entity in most AMQP operations; most things happen at the 
granularity of channels.

</I>
The broker does a reasonably good job of treating channels fairly. Large 
messages will be split across multiple frames, allowing smaller messages 
from other channels to be interleaved.

As you say, sending the messages across different TCP connections just 
delegates the problem to the OS. That's probably a good thing, but 
whether it actually gives you any better fairness only testing will reveal.


Matthias.
