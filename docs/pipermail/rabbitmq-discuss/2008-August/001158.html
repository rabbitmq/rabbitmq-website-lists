<PRE>Hi Guillaume,

Thanks for bringing the need of a PHP library to my attention. This
reminds me that this been requested in the past as well.

I can understand your apprehension in taking on this task.

So I have added this to the list of things can be tackled by members
of the community in the Endless Summer of Code
(<A HREF="https://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/EndlessSummerOfCode">https://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/EndlessSummerOfCode</A>), maybe this will
get picked up by somebody.


&gt;<i> I did plan on looking into possible ways of implementing it in php
</I>&gt;<i> though so if you have any links (other than

</I>&gt;<i> which I've already read) that would be useful I'd like to see them.
</I>
Unfortunately there is not that much further documentation on this
particular subject that I know of, which is why the article was
written in the first place. However, if anybody else knows of any
other articles on this topic, I wish to stand corrected.

The best advice I could give is not to be too daunted by the
immenseness of the task - after you have grasped the central concepts,
it is fairly straight forward.

The second best advice I can give is not be too shy to publish code
that is still in it's infancy - everybody out there knows that
software is not a perfectly formed work of art from the very first
line of code onwards :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't expect something soon though because I'll first have to
</I>&gt;<i> familiarize myself with the protocol (though py-amqplib is so
</I>&gt;<i> amazingly well commented that it will be a great help here and there
</I>&gt;<i> are the other client implementations I can go though)
</I>
Another great pointer would be Aman's Ruby client for AMQP:
<A HREF="http://github.com/tmm1/amqp/tree/master">http://github.com/tmm1/amqp/tree/master</A>

&gt;<i> into how to implement it. php is pretty good for quick processing of
</I>&gt;<i> web requests but implementing anything substantial in it tends to
</I>&gt;<i> bring incredible pain.
</I>
HTH,

Ben
