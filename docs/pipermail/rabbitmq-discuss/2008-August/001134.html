<PRE>Hi,

Never mind. I figured out what was happening. We're doing something
slightly odd in that we're sharing a single connection between several
threads that are running in different classloaders. The connections are
thread safe but something strange happens when you run code that creates a
channel, ticket and connects to a queue in different classloaders. By
making that part of the code synchronized it works fine.

Regards,

Dave

Hey,

The followings warnings have just started appearing in our RabbitMQ logs:
&quot;=WARNING REPORT==== 5-Aug-2008::14:06:15 ===
Lax ticket check mode: ignoring cross-realm access for ticket 101&quot;

Any idea what that is usually a sign of? I thought it might be sharing a
ticket between different channels but I don't do that. The only thing I've
really changed is that I've started listening on a topic. Before I used to
just use queues.

Thanks,

Dave
