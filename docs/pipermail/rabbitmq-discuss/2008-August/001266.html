You question from yesterday hasn't been forgotten :-)

&gt;<i> successful establish connection with RabbitMQ inside my Flex application in

</I>
Off the top of my head I don't know what is going wrong in your setup,
so I will investigate this, but I also have lots of other Rabbit
questions to follow up on as well, so being a limited resource, I'm
trying to spread things around fairly.

Thanks for your patience,

Ben
