<PRE>I've run into another issue with mod_rabbitmq -- it only appears to
deliver 100 messages at a time. This isn't due to ejabberd rate settings
-- I've tried with no shapers configured, and verified that I can send
more than 100 messages at at time directly between user accounts.
However, when sending through a mod_rabbitmq topic exchange (haven't
tried the other types), only 100 messages can be consumed until the
account logs off and back in.

Say you send 1000 messages to the exchange. After 100 messages, the
subscribed consumer stops consuming and delivering messages. But if the
client logs off and back in, another 100 messages are delivered.

I don't see anything obvious in the mod_rabbitmq source that would be
causing this. I'm using rabbit 1.4.0 beta, mod_rabbitmq from hg, and
ejabberd 2.0.2 beta.

Any ideas? If this isn't the right forum for mod_rabbitmq questions, can
someone point me to a more appropriate one?

Thanks,

JP
