</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Okay, I did not think of this type of solution, but I think this would

</I>

I will need queues for the individuals themselves plus for all the groups -
communication can be both 1:1 and 1:many.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Note that you do not necessarily need an AMQP instance on machine that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; clients run on. Multiple remote clients can connect to a single broker
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; instance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, but for the sake of performance I think that the more I can
</I>&gt;<i> distribute
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the work load the better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, but wouldn't you want the main load to be with the consumers,
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. where the real work is being done? The broker is just an
</I>&gt;<i> intermdiary that routes messages in an efficient fashion. Under normal
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances I would want to be allocating a lot more resources to be
</I>&gt;<i> doing the real work rather than distributing it.
</I>

I wasn't clear earlier: I want to avoid having a bottleneck in the middle as
today. But I am not sure what the best option is right now, but I will try
some scenarios to see what fits the best.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally you should be using a small (relative to the workload) number
</I>&gt;<i> of Rabbit instances to farm out work to a large number of workers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not to say that you can't have large Rabbit clusters, it's
</I>&gt;<i> just that Rabbit, as a communication fabric, shouldn't consume the
</I>&gt;<i> lion share of your resources.
</I>

Having the workers and Rabbit share machines will allow me to make a very
elegant architecture that scales very well since adding a new machine does
not require more than adding it to the cluster. But you are right that there
could be some side effects in play here that I need to iron out before I get
a good solution.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Indeed! The machines are already there and cannot be removed, but with
</I>&gt;<i> AMQP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think that I can let them do more of the work in my system and remove
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the machines that connect the machines where the consumer processes run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might be interested in a feature of the AMQP spec called basic.qos
</I>&gt;<i> which allows for better load balancing. We have not implemented it yet
</I>&gt;<i> in Rabbit because of two reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. It is tricky to get right and verify it's correctness;
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Few people have asked for it yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But we do have a plan of how we'd like to implement it.
</I>

That does sound interesting, but for my application I think that the current
Rabbit implementation will be fast enough since the task is to get a control
plane in place and let an underlying IP network carry the heavy duty traffic
between users.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The size of your broker cluster will depend (amongst other factors) on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the amount of messages you need the system to be able to handle.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A system today consisting of 100 &quot;consumer&quot; machines plus some inner
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machines handles in the neighbourhood of 3,000 message per second.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So when I aim to remove the inner machines that does the most of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intelligence regarding routing of the messages I expect to get rid of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inner bottleneck and thus get a higher performance... or at least one
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is closer to the limits of the &quot;consumer&quot; machines which I think is a
</I>&gt;<i> better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; constraint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may want to check out the performance metrics of a single broker
</I>&gt;<i> with a single producer and a single consumer using the ProducerMain
</I>&gt;<i> and ConsumerMain test classes from the RabbitMQ Java library, just to
</I>&gt;<i> calibrate your expectations for yourself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry if I sound a bit vague at times but I have only just read about
</I>&gt;<i> AMQP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and are now trying to get the concepts for a new AMQP based architecture
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not a problem. There are various sources of information about the
</I>&gt;<i> concepts of AMQP, not least to mention the specification :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the standard - way easier to read than others I have had to deal
</I>with in the past...

Cheers,
Torben
