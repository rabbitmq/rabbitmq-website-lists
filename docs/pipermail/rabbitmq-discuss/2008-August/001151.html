<PRE>Hi Rui,

Thanks for your patch. It looks good. I'll apply it now.

Neither are we :-) but I've been treating content_type as if it were a 
MIME type in other situations, so we may as well do the same here.

&gt;<i> As a note, the ruby stomp client is using &quot;content-type&quot; as a MIME

</I>&gt;<i> in &quot;content-type= text/plain; charset=utf-8&quot;.
</I>
This seems reasonable. I don't like the idea of doing any parsing of 
this header, yet, though, until the formats are more precisely defined 
in the various standards.

&gt;<i> We should also consider the use of ActiveMQ &quot;type&quot; header instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> using &quot;content-type&quot;, or maybe translate between the two?  take a look

</I>
I think they're different - does JMSType always line up exactly with 
MIME content-type? Certainly in AMQP, there's an equivalent of the 
JMSType field which is otherwise undocumented, and is distinct from the 
content-type header. (The JMS mappings in 0-8 and 0-9 are a bit of a mess.)

Regards,
   Tony
