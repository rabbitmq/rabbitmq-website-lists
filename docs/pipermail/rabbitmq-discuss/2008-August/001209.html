My plan is to use Erlang for the consumers since they have to deal with a
very concise protocol so pattern matching and bit strings is just what the
doctor ordered!

The specific behaviour I am looking for is that when a message arrives in a
queue that a consumer is tied to that message will be sent to the consumer
directly (this is what I meant by interrupt-like) instead of having to
program the consumer to look in the queue for a message ever so often to see
if there is something for it (this is what I meant by polling).

The reason I am asking this is two-fold:

   1. Polling with most likely slow down the system if I have a lot of
   consumers looking for a message ever so often. This will be bad since some
   of the message scenarios has the contraint that all members in a group must
   be able to receive data on a separate medium within 500 ms. This constraint
   applies to all sizes of our system - even nationwide systems - so time
   should not be wasted anywhere.
   2. I have just completed a project in Erlang where I was forced to set up
   a polling mechanism to get messages from an embedded server running on a
   communications card we had to use. I hated and still hate that solution
   since the polling is a fix to a problem that fits a more interrupt-like
   behaviour a lot better.

Hope this makes my constraints and desired solution a bit clearer.

Cheers,
Torben
