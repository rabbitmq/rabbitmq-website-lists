You mean use cases for Twisted? It's a very nifty Python framework (in the
good sense) with many transports for easily building nonblocking/async
clients &amp; servers, kind of like Java's NIO. This is more important for
python than Java because of its threading.
As far as AMQP is concerned I planned to play with Twisted (while trying
to improve my python at the same time) and had thought about basing a
python AMQP client on Twisted, but with the shared connection for multiple
channels it turned out to be not so useful after all. The easy framework
integration might still be very valuable though.

As an aside, does anybody know whether the AMQP spec mandates the m:1
channel:connection relationship, or is that just what's implemented right
now in Rabbit? IMHO clients in general could also benefit greatly from
bonding multiple connections together; the Java client might be able to
use NIO for that. This could cut down connection contention with many
channels and allow for better network utilization, though it would need to
be handled by the broker as well. Just curious.
