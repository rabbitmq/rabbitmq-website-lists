I have tried to reproduce the above by running the 
com.rabbitmq.examples.MulticastMain test with the args &quot;-a -x 10 -s 
1024&quot;, and while I can make RabbitMQ crash with the default 95% limit, 
once I lowered the limit to 70% it kept going.

That's on an old-ish machine with only 4GB of memory though. It's 
conceivable that a faster machine with more memory requires more of a 
margin. 40%, which is the lowest limit you tried, is quite low, but it 
may be worth trying even lower limits.

Can you send us the code for your tests? I'd like to gain a better 
understanding of exactly what parts of RabbitMQ get stressed, and how 
your test differs from what MulticastMain with the above params does.


Also, what version of Erlang are you running?


Regards,

Matthias.
