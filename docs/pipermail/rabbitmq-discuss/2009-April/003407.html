<PRE>Matthias,

Thank you for replying on this.

The auto_delete's per connection is a good idea. I had considered it but it
seemed like duplicating many bindings per connection per 'primary' queue
might have unnecessary overhead. I suppose there probably wouldn't be more
than a few per user, but how does creating new queues and ~15 or so bindings
for each affect system performance? The other reason for avoiding
re-creation of bindings each time is that the topics are collected from a
user-profile from a database. I really liked the exchange for this reason
because it allowed for minimizing DB-calls. I realize this is probably a
minor point though.

Lastly, the current 'primary' queue allows me to store messages/events in
it, so when the first client connects it can consume past messages and
display them in a &quot;here's what you missed while you were away&quot; kind of case.
I wouldn't be able to get this same behaviour with auto_delete queue's since
(as far as I know) there's no way to 'synchronize' their contents with the
ones of the' primary' queue.

As for acknowledgements, I'm not using them in this case so I'm not too
worried about that.
