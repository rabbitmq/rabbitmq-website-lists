<PRE>Terry,

Thanks for that detailed note.  Very useful.  Indeed, I have heard a
lot of good things about twisted and txAMQP as a way for Pythonists to
Rabbit.  Mainly this is anecdotal stuff that is hard to remember but
from time to time I get to snapshot a use case and stick it on
del.icio.us.  Concerning ways to make txAMQP better, my impression was
that this was use case driven and not dissatisfaction.  As soon as I
can, I shall encourage the people concerned to suggest away.

&gt;<i> Hi Oliver (and Alexis)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think most people are using txAMQP and py-amqplib. &#160;I hear good things

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on the use cases which folks wish to support. &#160;I am not qualified
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to discuss those ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nor am I :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I can make a few quick points:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- If you're not working with Twisted, or planning to, then using txAMQP is
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; out of the question. This is a litmus test - if you're doing Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; stuff you will surely want txAMQP; if not you will surely want
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; py-amqplib.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- txAMQP also includes Thrift support
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; (<A HREF="http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/">http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/</A>). &#160;That's really nice if you're
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; interested in RPC. I use txAMQP all the time, and once you have
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; exchanges and queues set up and bound etc., you can make regular Python
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; Twisted calls to methods in remote services and you get back a Deferred
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; that fires when the result is available. All this goes through AMQP but
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; you're not aware of that - txAMQP hides all the details of thrift and
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; AMQP. &#160;I certainly wouldn't say it's simple to put all this together,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; but if you're heading in that direction you're likely going to want
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; something like that anyway. But, see above comment - you have to drink
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; the Twisted Kool-Aid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- I can't say anything in particular about qpid (btw, it's a broker, not a
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; client library - just in case that wasn't clear). I mention this because
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; you say you're going to use RabbitMQ but then you mention qpid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- We (at Fluidinfo) are using txAMQP all the time, and are committed to
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; supporting and improving it. &#160;We have not yet done much stress or
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; performance testing, but we'll get there. It's a young project. There
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; are a few people who regularly submit questions, test things, and submit
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; fixes. &#160;We are also very concerned with performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- Esteve Fernandez (who wrote the txAMQP code) told me the other day that
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; he'd managed to hook txAMQP up to Django. That's not released but he'll
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; surely be happy to send you the code if you want it. He's got a lot
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; going on just now, so may not reply until next week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alexis, please feel free to post your thoughts, or feedback you've had from
</I>&gt;<i> others, about how txAMQP might be improved. You, or anyone, can also submit
</I>&gt;<i> comments or questions via our Launchpad PPA. <A HREF="https://launchpad.net/txamqp">https://launchpad.net/txamqp</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, hope that helps!
