</I>
That, in combination with a basic.qos prefetch count of 1, should work.

More specifically ...

- create a direct exchange to which tasks get published, using the task 
type as the routing key

- create one queue per task type and bind it to the direct exchange with 
the tasks type as the binding key

- let each worker machine open a channel, set the basic.qos prefetch 
count to 1, and then subscribe to (basic.consume) each of the queues 
corresponding to task types supported by that worker.

- when a worker is done with a task it basic.ack's the message


The prefetch count limits the number of tasks a worker will be sent 
before ack'ing them. Note that the basic.qos functionality required to 
do that has not made it into an official release yet; you'll have to use 
  a recent snapshot of the RabbitMQ source. Your example is actually a 
pretty interesting use case for basic.qos, exploiting some of the more 
advanced aspects of that feature, so I'd love to hear how it works out 
for you.


Regards,

Matthias.
