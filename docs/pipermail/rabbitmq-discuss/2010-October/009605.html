<PRE>James,

&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> i understand this, and the code in the repository[3] to indicate that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the 115,6,83 at the start of the fourth line of the content vector,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> above, was decoded as a short 16/signed instead of the intended six byte
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> short string. given which state, the subsequent vector
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;&lt;84,82,73,78,71,7,80, ...&gt;&gt; matched no pattern. do i understand these
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> events correctly?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> See <A HREF="http://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/Amqp091Errata#section_3">http://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/Amqp091Errata#section_3</A> for a bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more information, but in short this is an area where we believe the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spec to be incorrect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ok. it would help, if the page which describes that rabbitmq implements
</I>&gt;<i> 0.9.1 were to include something to the effect that the specification
</I>&gt;<i> which version 2 purports to support is not the one to which the page
</I>&gt;<i> links, but some other. perhaps it could also include a link to that
</I>&gt;<i> other specification, or at least to the wiki errata page. perhaps the
</I>&gt;<i> release notes page could include the topic. or perhaps the release news
</I>&gt;<i> page.
</I>
In general RabbitMQ tries very hard to implement the letter of the 
specification; however there are a few things in the published AMQP 
0-9-1, as in most specifications, that are either ambiguous or 
inconsistent.  In those cases we set out in the errata what is it 
RabbitMQ /does/ do.  This is not an unusual situation.

As an egregious though amusing example, see the published *AMQP 0-8* 
specification under the heading &quot;4.2.2 Protocol Header&quot;.

If you are cross because this cost you time and effort, then I 
sympathise -- we've spent rather a lot of time and effort ourselves 
trying to implement 0-9-1 in a way that it consistent /and/ 
interoperates with other implementations.

&gt;&gt;<i> The upshot is that there isn't a way to put short strings in tables;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you have to use long strings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> evidently.
</I>&gt;<i> the question remains, whether rabbitmq's intention is that, a library
</I>&gt;<i> which purports to implement the standard now needs to not only negotiate
</I>&gt;<i> protocol version, but also implementation?
</I>
Sadly, it is a choice between being faithful to the specification and 
working with the implementations extant.  For us, too.

[...]
&gt;<i> can one expect
</I>&gt;<i> that discussion to proceed to a conclusion? to a ratified errata for the
</I>&gt;<i> specification itself? if one expects implementors to follow a ratified,
</I>&gt;<i> published, standard specification to which the implementations purport
</I>&gt;<i> to conform, that would be appropriate.
</I>
I'm not going to disagree.


Michael.
