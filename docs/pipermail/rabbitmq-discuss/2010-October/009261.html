Why is your water mark set so low? I thought you said you had 2GB of 
memory in the machine, which with the default setting of the mark at 0.4 
would be about 819Mb.

&gt;<i> Am I reading that wrong, or does there seem to be a lot of memory being

</I>
Toke would probably help since you have one queue with nearly 600k 
messages. But 200Mb is really very little to give to a rabbit that is 
supposed to handle the message volume you have. So I'd start be 
increasing that.

&gt;<i> The other strange thing is that the process slurping from that queue

</I>
A prefetch of 1000 is quite high. I'd suggest lowering that.

&gt;<i> If the client isn't also a producer (at least on that channel), but is
</I>&gt;<i> in transactional mode, will the high water mark prevent tx.commit
</I>&gt;<i> messages from being handled?
</I>
Blocking happens at the *connection* level. A client connection that 
hasn't done any publishing will not be blocked.


Regards,

Matthias.
