I don't think there's really a reason for having RabbitMQ duplicate file 
writes - the Windows software RAID or hardware RAID or a SAN can do 
that. Real active-active is of course another story.

You can change the node name by setting the environment variable 
RABBITMQ_NODENAME to something like <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">rabbit at myhostname.</A> Note that 
myhostname must be resolvable by DNS or the hosts file.

Sorry to hear that :(

Cheers, Simon
