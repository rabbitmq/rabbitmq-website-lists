Hi Rob,

thanks for taking the time to look into this. Sorry that I haven't
commented earlier but I moved and had no internet/mail/list access etc.

This is good. :)

</I>
This is unfortunately not so good and pretty much what I was hoping to
avoid. It can lead to excessive context switching (the #1 enemy), and with
a large number of Channels to really large memory use.
I've looked at the code and understand that ChannelDispatcher will
not deadlock when a consumer calls back with Channel ops, since it runs in
the same thread. However, this is &quot;recursive&quot; in the sense that call
chains that are too deep could blow the stack - unlikely though.
I know that this is unavoidable since Java does not have real
continuations, but if that's the acceptable tradeoff then we might as well
just pull a Thread from an arbitrary pool, note that in the dispatcher and
do any channel ops. Any callbacks from a consumer on that thread should
now be able to re-enter the dispatcher. When all is done just clear the
current thread from the dispatcher and pop out.
That way we can have a freely configurable ExecutorService and less
threads with no deadlock on callback.

I should probably add that I just made that up and haven't tested it yet,
but maybe you find the idea interesting. :-)
