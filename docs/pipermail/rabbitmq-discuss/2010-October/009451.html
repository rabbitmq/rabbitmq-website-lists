So we're talking about active / passive here, right?

The real issue is that you need some sort of redundant, shared storage. 
Once you've got that, RabbitMQ will tolerate being killed on one machine 
with said storage and restarted on another one.

&gt;<i> We don't need HA or real-time failover, we just need to make sure that
</I>&gt;<i> persistent messages get stored on the broker and backed up somewhere
</I>&gt;<i> else so that if the broker server goes belly up we can somehow restore
</I>&gt;<i> what was in the queue at the time that the server failed.
</I>
Ah, in that case you don't even need a backup broker (and hence shared 
storage). Just redundant storage. Is that practical?

Cheers, Simon
