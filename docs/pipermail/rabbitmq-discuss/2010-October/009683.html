<PRE>Alex,

It's a bit more than that due to overheads and fragmentation. But not 
much more.

</I>
So rabbit is taking up 4GB when all the queues are empty? How many
queues are there? 1000? And how many connections?

&gt;<i> Another observation with 2.1.1 is that the most rdq files in

</I>
2.1.1 is less eager in deleting rdq files than previous versions. This
helps in reducing the number of writes in cases where a message is
routed to multiple queues and consumed+ack'd very quickly. So this is
nothing to worry about.

&gt;<i> because the broker was so busy &quot;rabbitmqctl list_queues&quot; could not

</I>
How frequently are you running 'rabbitmqctl list_queues'? If it is run 
fairly frequently it can significantly delay freeing up memory since 
queues don't get a chance to hibernate.


Regards,

Matthias.
