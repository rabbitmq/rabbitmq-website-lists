It's in draft form at the moment.  The thinking is to retain the same
flexibility in terms of routing, but simplify the tools needed to
deliver it.




&gt;<i> I think sessions are actually make things simpler e.g. coupling the
</I>&gt;<i> lifespan of a session to the lifespan of auto deleting, exclusive
</I>&gt;<i> queues for instance.
</I>
Well, yes, possibly, provided complexity is decreased elsewhere.  The
1.0 work at the moment can be seen as trying to reduce the number of
moving parts back down to something more like AMQP's core elegance.


&gt;<i> IMO we should just sketch a short history of the AMQP specifications
</I>&gt;<i> and make a note that the article is about version 0.10. This probably
</I>&gt;<i> means (among other things) we should put sessions into the model.
</I>
I would not make the article about 0-10.  It would be more useful to
just have separate sections.



&gt;<i> And this is where things get a bit involved. Did the specs involve
</I>&gt;<i> that much between revisions? If not it would make sense to just write
</I>&gt;<i> about the 0.10 way of handling errors.
</I>
By all means write about that under the 0-10 section.   Since we won't
support 0-10 and nor will OpenAMQ, I'd rather see a good summary of
AMQP in the abstract first of all, and smaller sections about the
specs.




&gt;<i> Of course. We should put our efforts into making the description
</I>&gt;<i> _simple_ not complete.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How should we proceed? Do we just assume 0.10 for everything, sketch
</I>&gt;<i> out the rough differences between 0.8, 0.9 ... and make the model
</I>&gt;<i> complete (including transactions, sessions etc.)?
</I>
I would much rather see a description of how AMQP works in general
terms focussing on routing and delivery using exchanges and queues,
with shorter sections on each spec.
