Hi Jason,

I have thought more about it and now I'm wondering if it's even possible to redeclare a 
queue in a cluster that happens to reside on a node that currently is not reachable from 
cluster? Can't test at the moment, since I decommissioned my cluster vms some time ago :)

In theory, doesn't the queue still exist when queue.declare with active=true is attempted? 
The contents might not be replicated, but all metadata are.

Have you actually tried it? I kind of expect that if you don't remove a node from cluster, 
you won't be able to redeclare a queue. Does this sound reasonable?

</I>
I am also primarily looking at cluster for failover capabilities. I am getting better 
failover from unclustered brokers - an alternative approach that Tony described earlier 
today in another thread [1]. YMMV of course.
