<PRE>Ryan,

Indeed.

&gt;<i> One thing that we'd

</I>&gt;<i> host which would then make sure the queues created by the client are

</I>&gt;<i> clustering guide implies that rabbit already does this sort of load 
</I>&gt;<i> balancing -- this was why we didn't think it was necessary to run 
</I>&gt;<i> ScalabilityTest on multiple hosts.  But, now that I think about it, 
</I>&gt;<i> ScalabilityTest only opens up one connection for the entire duration of 
</I>&gt;<i> the test so it's not weird that said connection only points at one host.
</I>
There is indeed some load balancing going on but, as you say, it will 
only come into play when new connections are established. Also, 
connection.redirect has been removed from version 0-9-1 of the AMQP spec 
- ordinary load balancers should do a much better job so there is no 
point in AMQP attempting to duplicate their functionality.

&gt;<i> another way to structure this would be to partition on routing key,
</I>&gt;<i> such that when sending to or binding to a particular routing key, the
</I>&gt;<i> client connects to the same cluster.  The downside of this is that,
</I>&gt;<i> at the extreme, each chat room participant will have to maintain as
</I>&gt;<i> many connections as rooms they are in (since at the extreme each chat
</I>&gt;<i> room would be hosted in its own cluster).  But assuming K (the number
</I>&gt;<i> of chat rooms a user can be in) is finite, then it's not as bad as
</I>&gt;<i> replicating every message across the entire cluster.
</I>
That sounds like a good way to do the partitioning - it requires very 
little knowledge on part of the clients and should scale very well.


Matthias.
