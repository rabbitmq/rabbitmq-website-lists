<PRE>HI Dmitriy,

I don't expect the messages to get moved when the node comes back
up....well it would be nice, but I accept that it doesn't happen (in
fact, if the queue has been redeclared on another node during the
downtime, the messages &quot;appear&quot; to be lost when the downed node
returns...I'm sure they could be recovered from the persister log).

The fact that Node A is down is the crux of the issue (maybe it's
power supply blew? maybe it's disks are toast). Anyone subscribed to a
Node A-sourced queue via Node B gets orphaned (they don't get notified
it doesn't exist anymore, and recreation by someone else on Node B
doesn't apply to them). The point of our cluster is failover with the
future possibility of scaling the cluster. But first and foremost,
fail over. If subscribers on Node B get orphaned, they can't help
drain the queue when its been recreated, and it could be some time
before anyone realizes they're just twiddling their thumbs.

I realize message replication in a cluster is not an easy problem. But
I think it's fair to assume the queue itself (w/o messages) will be
migrated to a still alive node, or any subscribers to that queue on a
still alive node will get booted so they don't get orphaned.
