</I>
Answering my own question, another way to structure this would be to 
partition on routing key, such that when sending to or binding to a 
particular routing key, the client connects to the same cluster.  The 
downside of this is that, at the extreme, each chat room participant 
will have to maintain as many connections as rooms they are in (since at 
the extreme each chat room would be hosted in its own cluster).  But 
assuming K (the number of chat rooms a user can be in) is finite, then 
it's not as bad as replicating every message across the entire cluster.
