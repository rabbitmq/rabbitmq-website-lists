<PRE>Hey all,

This is Doug at Interactive Mediums. I work with Dave, so you may see
us alternate back and forth responding to this thread as we work
through this issue. Thanks a lot for the help so far.

On Feb 3, 9:45&#160;am, Dmitriy Samovskiy

&gt;<i> I suspect that your response from net_adm:names() will be {error,timeout} and it will

</I>
We don't get exactly that error. Instead we are getting
{error,address}.

  [<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">root at db1</A> home]# erl -sname foo -cookie coo
  Erlang (BEAM) emulator version 5.6.3 [source] [64-bit] [smp:8]

  Eshell V5.6.3  (abort with ^G)
  (<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">foo at db1</A>)1&gt; net_adm:names().

  ... long pause ...

  {error,address}
  (<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">foo at db1</A>)2&gt;
  BREAK: (a)bort (c)ontinue (p)roc info (i)nfo (l)oaded
         (v)ersion (k)ill (D)b-tables (d)istribution


&gt;<i> After you exit from erl, please do grep -r /usr/lib/erlang/erts-5.6.5/bin /var/log/*
</I>&gt;<i> (please replace 5.6.5 with emulator version that is displayed when you start erl).
</I>&gt;<i> Anything of interest in the output? I am particularly looking for something related to
</I>&gt;<i> auth, or access being denied. Interesting lines are likely to come from auth.log or its
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent on your system, and there should be many similar lines (unless your syslog
</I>&gt;<i> suppresses dup lines - mine didn't). If nothing shows up, maybe try similar greps -
</I>&gt;<i> erlang, erts.
</I>
grep didn't turn up anything in these directories. I grepped for
erlang, erts, and the absolute path to the erlang bin directory.

&gt;<i> And finally, if you have or can get strace on the target system, could you please run this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> % strace -e trace=write -o erl_strace.log erl -sname -cookie coo
</I>
I'm assuming that there should have been a &quot;foo&quot; after -sname in the
command above. I added that when running the next commands.

&gt;<i> and do the same net_adm:names() in erlang shell. When it times out, exit erlang shell and
</I>&gt;<i> take a look at erl_strace.log. I expect that at the end of that file you will see many
</I>&gt;<i> lines like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --- SIGCHLD (Child exited) @ 0 (0) ---
</I>&gt;<i> --- SIGPIPE (Broken pipe) @ 0 (0) ---
</I>&gt;<i> --- SIGPIPE (Broken pipe) @ 0 (0) ---
</I>&gt;<i> --- SIGPIPE (Broken pipe) @ 0 (0) ---
</I>&gt;<i> --- SIGCHLD (Child exited) @ 0 (0) ---
</I>&gt;<i> --- SIGPIPE (Broken pipe) @ 0 (0) ---
</I>&gt;<i> --- SIGCHLD (Child exited) @ 0 (0) ---
</I>&gt;<i> --- SIGPIPE (Broken pipe) @ 0 (0) ---
</I>&gt;<i> --- SIGCHLD (Child exited) @ 0 (0) ---
</I>&gt;<i> --- SIGPIPE (Broken pipe) @ 0 (0) ---
</I>
This is all we're getting:

  --- SIGCHLD (Child exited) @ 0 (0) ---
  --- SIGCHLD (Child exited) @ 0 (0) ---
  write(6, &quot;\0&quot;, 1)                       = 1
  --- SIGINT (Interrupt) @ 0 (0) ---
  write(6, &quot;I&quot;, 1)                        = 1
  --- SIGINT (Interrupt) @ 0 (0) ---
  write(6, &quot;I&quot;, 1)                        = 1

&gt;<i> Feel free to do strace with -e trace=all or -e verbose=all.
</I>
We ran this test using strace -e trace=all on the machine that is
failing as well as on a different machine that is working fine. The
machine that is failing is running RHEL 5.2 (64-bit). The box that
works is running CentOS 5 (32-bit).

&gt;<i>From those logs, the two differences that jumped out are:
</I>  1) Calls to mmap have a MAP_32BIT flag set. I'm assuming this is
expected due to the fact that our new machine is running a 64bit OS.
      -mmap2(NULL, 10489856, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC,
MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x68b4000
      +mmap(NULL, 10489856, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC,
MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_32BIT, -1, 0) = 0x471a4000

  2) Erlang seems to drop into a loop waiting on a futex. On the 64bit
machine, its FUTEX_WAIT commands also fail with &quot;EAGAIN (Resource
temporarily unavailable)&quot;. On the 32-bit machine, those same commands
always succeed, though the same number of repeats occur.

    +futex(0x7fff9f5fdab0, FUTEX_WAKE, 1)    = 1
    +futex(0x7fff9f5fdad8, FUTEX_WAKE, 1)    = 1
    +futex(0x7fff9f5fdadc, FUTEX_WAIT, 1, NULL) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource
temporarily unavailable)
    +futex(0x7fff9f5fdab0, FUTEX_WAKE, 1)    = 0

&gt;<i> What Linux distro are you using? uname -a? Any particular details how you installed the
</I>&gt;<i> OS? If it's safe to share, maybe output of &quot;rpm -qa&quot; or &quot;dpkg -l&quot;?
</I>
[<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">textme at db1</A> ~]$ cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.2 (Tikanga)
[<A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-discuss">textme at db1</A> ~]$ uname -a
Linux db1.interactivemediums.com 2.6.18-92.1.6.el5 #1 SMP Fri Jun 20
02:36:06 EDT 2008 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

&gt;<i> And like Matthias said before, access to box or image of the box will be most helpful.
</I>
We'll get in touch with you guys off list to get you access so you can
poke around. Expect an email from Dave.
