<PRE>Ben,

Thanks for the reply and suggestions. I will look at the list threads.

The system I am building is, from the amqp broker point of view at 
least, very producer oriented for sure. What is vital is that a producer 
can safely hand off a message to the broker, knowing that at some time a 
consumer will get it. That is, once the message is published the 
responsibility of that message is moved to the broker...even if no 
consumer currently exists. The issue I am struggling with is that if I 
have to create and bind a queue in the producer to make this happen then 
I have already routed the message. This eliminates what consumers can do 
in the way of 'subscribing' to exchanges to have messages routed to it.

Mark.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Last value caching on a per exchange/routing key basis - this has
</I>&gt;<i> some similarities with what (I think) you're trying to achieve -
</I>&gt;<i> please read the relevant thread for the background;
</I>&gt;<i> - Whether or not AMQP events should be published so that application
</I>&gt;<i> code can subscribe and implement custom behavior (reminiscent of a
</I>&gt;<i> micro-kernel architecture);
</I>&gt;<i> - The age old question of why persistence is defined on a per-message
</I>&gt;<i> basis as opposed to a per-queue basis (this is more of a protocol
</I>&gt;<i> revision question - the implementors of other AMQP brokers may have
</I>&gt;<i> something to say about this);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having said this, there are a few more general questions you might to
</I>&gt;<i> address, which will be influenced by your actual requirements:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The resource consumption aspect of saving *everything*, including
</I>&gt;<i> stuff that nobody cares about - which ties into the next point;
</I>&gt;<i> - In general, the flavor of AMQP is consumer-driven messaging, i.e. if
</I>&gt;<i> you care about something, you'll take the necessary steps to get that
</I>&gt;<i> something - part of your suggestion contradicts this principle to an
</I>&gt;<i> extent - whether or not that is bad is up to interpretation;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully this can serve as a starting point for a discussion,
