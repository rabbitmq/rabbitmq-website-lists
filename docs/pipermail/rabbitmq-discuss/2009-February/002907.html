<PRE>Thanks for the feedback on this.

As Valentino and Al point out, keeping things compact is important,
and not all users are running or want to run a web framework with
RabbitMQ.  Though of course some will.

So one option here is to use the built-in HTTP capability rather than
a web framework.  For example, to provide an interface to rabbitmqctl
that lets people use a browser to keep an eye on the broker.

On the other hand people may prefer programmatic management.
