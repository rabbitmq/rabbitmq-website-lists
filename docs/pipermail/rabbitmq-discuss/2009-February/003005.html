<PRE>A question to the wise.  Is it legal, advisable/risky or simply deviant
to subscribe to multiple queues from the same Consumer?

I have a java client implementing the Consumer interface which calls
Channel.basicConsume on two queues, stays subscribed for about 10s and
then calls basicCancel.

This tends to work for a few calls and then when calling
Channel.basicConsume for the second queue it hangs.  Always the second
queue.

Is there something fundamentally wrong with the same consumer consuming
two queues?
