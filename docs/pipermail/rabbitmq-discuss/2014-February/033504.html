Subject: Capturing chang in IP address at the listener

Hi Alan,

Thank you so much for all your earlier replies. Could you kindly throw some light on following two issues we have faced with rabbitmq-c (V0.3) running in Ubuntu 12.04?

1. I created a listener and a queue is created at the broker. I changed my system IP address and restarted network manager. I could ping to the broker with this new IP address. However the queue created at the broker still shows the old IP address and any message published on this queue after IP change is not received by the client. The amqp_simple_wait_frame_noblock() API does not give any error event for IP address change; it was giving AMQP_STATUS_TIMEOUT. Is there a way capture this run time IP address change at the listener?

2. I created two listener threads having separate connection. I turned off my network router. One listener was able to get AMQP_STATUS_SSL_ERROR/AMQP_STATUS_SSL_CONNECTION_FAILED error while the other listener was still giving AMQP_STATUS_TIMEOUT. I was expecting AMQP_STATUS_SSL_ERROR/AMQP_STATUS_SSL_CONNECTION_FAILED error at both the listener. What could be the reason for this behaviour?

Thanks and regards,
Shashank
