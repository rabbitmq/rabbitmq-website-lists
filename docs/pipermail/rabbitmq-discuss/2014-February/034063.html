OK. Looking at how things evolve step by step:

&gt;<i> Now imagine a network event occurs and the cluster splits.
</I>
At this point the network is partitioned: both side of the cluster are 
running separately, each believing that the other has gone down. So on 
A, all the queues that had masters on B fail over to A, and vice versa on B.

So this is the nub of why network partitions are a big deal; the two 
sides of the cluster both think they are authoritative and both start to 
evolve separately.

&gt;<i> Autoheal kicks in,
</I>
Of course autoheal will not kick in until the underlying network 
partition is resolved; until the two sides can see each other they will 
not have a clue anything has gone wrong (well, more wrong than node 
failure).

&gt;<i> selects a loser (say, B), and restarts it to rejoin the
</I>&gt;<i> cluster. What happens to the data in queues that were mastered on B when
</I>&gt;<i> B restarts?
</I>
Hopefully at this point you have your answer: since A is the winning 
side, the queue state from A overwrites the queue state from B. And the 
queue state from A will be whatever the state was at the time of the 
split (even for queues mastered on B), with whatever changes A has seen 
since.

Now, since you said earlier &quot;there is a VIP pointing at A&quot; then maybe no 
changes have been taking place on B anyway. But if there were any 
changes on B, you lost them.

Partitions are a big deal, and autoheal is not a panacea.

&gt;<i> And does it matter if the messages in the queue were
</I>&gt;<i> persistent or not?
</I>
No.

Cheers, Simon
