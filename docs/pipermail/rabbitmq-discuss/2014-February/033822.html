<PRE>I'm having trouble understanding exactly what problem you're describing. 
However, one thing leaps out at me: you've managed to (accidentally) 
make some of the queues used internally by federated exchanges 
*themselves* be federated with each other. This is likely to lead to odd 
behaviour. I can't guarantee that this is the problem you're describing, 
but it's certainly *a* problem.

You can either:

a) Rework your policies so that no policy which matches queues beginning 
with &quot;^federation:&quot; enables federation. (The policy &quot;federation enabled&quot; 
in the vhosts ControlCenter, MediaManager and Review could be changed to 
apply to &quot;exchanges&quot; rather than &quot;all&quot;)

or

b) Upgrade to RabbitMQ 3.2.3, which prevents this confusing and 
unhelpful behaviour from happening.

Cheers, Simon
