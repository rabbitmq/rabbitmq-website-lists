So the log indicates that the winning node ignored a request to start 
autohealing because it was already autohealing.

It's possible that there is a problem if a network partition occurs 
while autoheal is already happening. I'll file a bug to look into this, 
but it would help if you can show me any previous logs from this node - 
I assume that earlier (probably not much earlier) in the logs there were 
some more partition warnings and autoheal events?

</I>
Separately there is an issue where the management database might fail to 
recover after a network partition. I just replicated that yesterday; 
note that it's not connected to autoheal.

Cheers, Simon
