</I>
JVM language clients that support reconnection, including RabbitMQ Java client itself on branch bug14587, have a wrapper connection that
delegates everything to the underlying connection (so, implements com.rabbitmq.client.Connection) and adds a shutdown listener
that performs recovery:

 * Reconnects (creates a new delegate connection)
 * Reopens all channels (there is a wrapper Channel as well), including various listeners
 * Recovers queues, exchange, bindings, and consumers (in this order)

&gt;<i> Also, another consumer callback name &quot;handleCancel&quot;.  This will only be invoke when an unexpected cancellation by the broker.  That would also mean I would have to reconsume from the other node by creating another connection/channel.  I assume this does not get invoke during a restart of the broker or a force close connection.  That would only apply to the two that I mentioned, right?
</I>
Not &#8220;unexpected cancellation&#8221; but when the queue is deleted.
