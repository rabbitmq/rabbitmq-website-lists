<PRE>I just had to re-IP a cluster due to a network move.  One of the nodes was being unresponsive, so I wanted to get it disconnected from the cluster before I moved anything.  I ended up doing a forget_cluster_node --offline, figuring I could do a rabbitmqctl reset on the node once could get a response out of it.  I moved the node with MNESIA over, and it's running fine, but I can't run the reset command on the other node.  I had to reboot it to move it, and now if I try to start Rabbit, it of course complains that it thinks it's part of the cluster and the other nodes disagree, and it won't start.  But when I try to run rabbitmqctl reset or force_reset, it responds with a nodedown error.  Is there some way to get this working short of a rebuild?  Do I have to run some command to get erlang running without the RabbitMQ server on top of it?

Thanks,
Kale
