<PRE>I've attached the rabbitmqctl report for both nodes in this cluster.  You're right, Simon, I meant exchanges.  Pardon the slip.  I'm trolling through the logs now looking for anything that might be relevant to throw your way.  Thanks, guys.

Kale


Thanks,
Kale

The output of &quot;rabbitmqctl report&quot; would also be useful (from each node in the federation).

Also it would be good to understand whether you are talking about federated queues or exchanges. You say queues, but then you mention bindings and routing keys so I wonder if you mean exchanges?

Cheers, Simon
