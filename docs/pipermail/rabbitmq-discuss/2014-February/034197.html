The firehose taps into the path *into* and *out of* the queue, so it 
cannot possibly provide you with data on when messages actually land in 
the queue. Assuming that what you are looking at is the time difference 
between the &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; then any time delay there is most likely due 
to consumers not being able to keep up.

&gt;<i> Also, I want to mention that, using logging in my publisher, I found
</I>&gt;<i> out that, let 20 messages are published. But using management
</I>&gt;<i> console, I can see only 6-7 messages, all are in unacked state (we
</I>&gt;<i> send ack only after consumption by consumer, which takes some time).
</I>
The remaining messages either:
- are stuck on their way to the broker due to flow control, or
- did not get routed to any queue because their routing key did not 
match anything, or
- where consumed and acknowledged

&gt;<i> Please suggest me the path to take from here.
</I>
Try to come up with a short standalone program that demonstrates the 
behaviour you are seeing and post it to this list.

Matthias.
