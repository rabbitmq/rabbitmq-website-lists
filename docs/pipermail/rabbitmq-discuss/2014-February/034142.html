I encourage you to experiment with PerfTest - 
<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/java-tools.html#perftest">http://www.rabbitmq.com/java-tools.html#perftest</A> and compare results.

&gt;<i> I then resubmit all the messages in my internal queue on the
</I>&gt;<i> publisher side.  The result is always the same.  I'm always 3 or 4
</I>&gt;<i> messages short!
</I>
What do you mean? Are you saying that the publisher got an ack for these 
messages but the consumer never sees them?

&gt;<i> I then retested without a cluster and without shutting down.  After
</I>&gt;<i> my test run..and after the consumer successfully gets all the
</I>&gt;<i> messages I always find the same thing. sometimes I have thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> unacknowledged messages left in my publisher queue.  I'd come back 5
</I>&gt;<i> minutes later....still there.
</I>
What do you mean by &quot;the publisher queue&quot;? Are you referring to a queue 
in the publisher or a rabbitmq queue?

&gt;<i> Rabbit MQ is losing a few messages if both servers in the cluster are
</I>&gt;<i> shut down.
</I>
I can assure you it is not.

&gt;<i> Second one, Acks/Nacks seem to just get lost by Rabbit MQ.
</I>
I can assure you that does not happen.

&gt;<i> Third one...only happens now again...The producer actually receives
</I>&gt;<i> Acks for delivery tags/messages that don't exist in the its internal
</I>&gt;<i> queue.
</I>
I can assure you that does not happen.

Please capture a protocol trace for the publisher. 
<A HREF="https://www.rabbitmq.com/java-tools.html#tracer.">https://www.rabbitmq.com/java-tools.html#tracer.</A> If there is a problem 
then that will show up there.

&gt;<i> Fourth one....when both servers go down, sometimes, but not always,
</I>&gt;<i> the consumer will not throw an exception when it tries to read the
</I>&gt;<i> message in the while loop
</I>
That's normal TCP/IP behaviour. It takes time for disconnects to be 
detected. You can reduce the time by reducing the heartbeat interval 
configured in the client or server.

&gt;<i> if I use the TxCommit and TxRollback....I don't have any issues on
</I>&gt;<i> resending by resending everything in the producer's internal queue.
</I>&gt;<i> Message loss only seems to happen with PublishConfirms
</I>
Transactions are actually just a thin wrapper around Confirms. This is 
further evidence that the problems you are seeing are likely due to bugs 
in your application code.

Matthias.
