<PRE>&gt;<i> As the sentence you quoted states, the criteria for when messages are
</I>
&gt;<i> pulled down is threefold. In particular note the last part, i.e. &quot;the
</I>&gt;<i> upstream queue has 'spare' messages that are not being consumed&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, messages are only pulled to the downstream if the
</I>&gt;<i> upstream consumers cannot keep up.
</I>
But doesn't that mean that downstream won't help out an upstream when downstream is actively moving messages, even if upstream is not being drained?&#160; IOW, if consumers in Miami are happily taking messages from the miami queue, they won't steal messages from the new_york queue even if the consumers in New York are down and new_york is filling up?&#160; And couldn't a slow day in Miami (no jobs for them) cause the consumers in Miami to start picking off messages from new_york, unnecessarily causing cross-zone work cost?&#160; I don't want consumers in Miami to do New York work just because new_york has a queue depth of 2 while miami is quiet.

Federated queues seem like a pull behavior for LB/throughput, but HA is more of a push behavior; when a exchange is in trouble, it pushes its messages elsewhere.

&gt;<i> Right, so in the event that upstream consumers cannot keep up, messages 
</I>&gt;<i> would be pulled to the downstream and processed by downstream consumers, 
</I>&gt;<i> albeit more slowly. That results in a higher overall throughput than 
</I>&gt;<i> leaving the messages on the upstream. Can't see what's wrong with that.
</I>
I'm not looking for increased throughput, at least not at the expense of zone-locality of messages.&#160; I want messages to stay local to a zone unless it simply can't be handled there.&#160; Miami isn't very far from New York, but Singapore is.&#160; I think my alternate-exchange design accomplishes that, but I'm concerned about a-e routing loops (still unexplained).

Thanks,
Mordy
