<PRE>Robert,

Thanks so much for talking about this.

When you say &quot;if we could..&quot; do you plan to it and/or do you require help?

Would a custom exchange be useful here?


&gt;<i> One of our goals is to integrate the JavaScript and rabbitmq-http
</I>&gt;<i> portions, so that our webcode can make RPC calls the same as all of our
</I>&gt;<i> other processes. &#160;We also have some C# applications that we will tie
</I>&gt;<i> together with RabbitMQ and GPB. &#160;We also have Erlang projects which use
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ as the broker. &#160;It's worked out incredibly well for us, thus
</I>&gt;<i> far, and has helped us work toward tool integration without a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> headache or investment in writing interop-libraries.
</I>
Very cool!  I am extremely impressed.  Do you plan to blog about this?
