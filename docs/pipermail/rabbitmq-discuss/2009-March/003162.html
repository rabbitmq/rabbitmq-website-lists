<PRE>Hi Matthias,

Thanks for responding.

There is a couple of projects at work that will require an async system
based on message queues. I don't want to lose anything and I do want to
handle cases in which the message was consumed (and not acked yet) and
something bad happend. In which case, I want to ack a message only when I
know for sure that the actions that this message triggered finished
correctly.

So, the current behavior is well suite for me.

Regarding the blocking &quot;GET&quot; commands, I read about Kesterl (in the link I
gave below) and thought its an interesting approach to make pulling a bit
more efficient instead of sending the &quot;puller&quot; back to a short sleep.

That's basically the only scenario. I don't think its too important. What
was more important to me was understanding the exact Ack semantics (which is
implemented exactly as I want it to be :-) ).

With the new command line tool that allows getting the queue length, I can
easily write a script to let Nagios alert me if the rate of messages going
in is higher than the rate of them coming out.
