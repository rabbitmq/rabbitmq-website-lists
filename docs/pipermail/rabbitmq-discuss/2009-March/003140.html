Yes - the error message you were getting was due to a case clause that
didn't check for the non-existence of the rabbit_config table in
mnesia, because the non-existence of the table is not something that
would normally occur.

Well you would do exactly what you did beforehand, i.e. look at the
directory where you tell Rabbit to put the mnesia files, which is
/var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia in your case.

Possibly. This is why is important to able to capture the state of the
VM when the problem happens again, so that we can look into what is
missing and maybe try to find out why.
