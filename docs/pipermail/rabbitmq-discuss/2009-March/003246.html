That information is quite tricky to get hold of, and presenting it in a 
sensible form in rabbitmqctl is trickier still. Anyway, I've added this 
to our todo list.

That would involve solving the first part of the trickiness mentioned above.

The information is held in the channel processes' consumer_mapping state 
field. So you'd have to reach into the channel processes' state, which 
is certainly possible, but not straightforward. First though you need to 
get hold of all channel processes. Again, that's possible but not 
straightforward.

If I find a spare couple of hours I'll give it a try.


Matthias.
