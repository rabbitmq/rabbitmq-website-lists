The AMQP ack model for subscriptions and &quot;pull&quot; are identical. In both 
cases the message is kept on the server but is unavailable to other 
consumers until it either has been ack'ed (and gets removed), nack'ed 
(with basic.reject; though RabbitMQ does not implement that) or the 
channel/connection is closed (at which point the message becomes 
available to other consumers).

&gt;<i> Assuming when a message is pulled and not acked yet and no other 
</I>&gt;<i> consumer can pull it until its either acked or rejected back to the 
</I>&gt;<i> queue, will it have a certain timeout that it was pulled and wasn't 
</I>&gt;<i> acked for X amount of time?
</I>
There is no timeout on waiting for acks. Usually that is not a problem 
since the common cases of a missing ack - network or client failure - 
will result in the connection getting dropped (and thus trigger the 
behaviour described above). Still, a timeout could be useful to, say, 
deal with alive but unresponsive consumers. That has come up in 
discussion before. Is there a specific use case you have in mind that 
requires such functionality?


Regards,

Matthias.
