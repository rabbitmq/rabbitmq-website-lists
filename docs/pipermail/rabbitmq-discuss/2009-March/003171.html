</I>&gt;<i> Cool - and thanks for getting in touch.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would be interested in LShift's/CohesiveFT's opinion on the patent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filed by RedHat, per <A HREF="http://bit.ly/lTFb">http://bit.ly/lTFb</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a very interesting question.  We've brought this to the
</I>&gt;<i> attention of the AMQP Working Group, of which we are a member.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently the matter is under discussion - so keep an eye on how
</I>&gt;<i> things evolve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way AMQP works is that ALL members of the WG grant a patent
</I>&gt;<i> license to ALL implementers and users of AMQP for patents held that
</I>&gt;<i> may affect use of AMQP.  So anything in the specification is
</I>&gt;<i> definitely safe from patent abuse and this is upheld by a substantial
</I>&gt;<i> body of law and commercial interest.  This is similar to, say, the
</I>&gt;<i> W3C.  AMQP is protected from royalty and tenancy abuse, as befits an
</I>&gt;<i> Internet protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem with this particular patent application is that it covers
</I>&gt;<i> something not currently in the AMQP spec.  Were the AMQP spec to
</I>&gt;<i> include XML exchanges as an &quot;Extension&quot;, then Red Hat would be obliged
</I>&gt;<i> to grant licenses to users and implementers, if the patent had been
</I>&gt;<i> approved.  We don't expect this particular patent to get approved --
</I>&gt;<i> it is too 'obvious'.  In any case we and other members of the Working
</I>&gt;<i> Group are taking steps to make sure AMQP stays 100% free and open,
</I>&gt;<i> even for extensions of this sort.  We want that because it promotes
</I>&gt;<i> interop as the spec evolves, and attracts many more implementers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are however very annoyed about the Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt that
</I>&gt;<i> actions like this cause.  We are astonished that Red Hat applied for a
</I>&gt;<i> patent of this type -- as long ago as 2007 would you believe --
</I>&gt;<i> without talking to the Working Group about the best way to protect
</I>&gt;<i> AMQP Extensions from patent spam and other abuse such as trolling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The cheapest and easiest solution would have been to establish
</I>&gt;<i> defensive prior art by making this very obvious design very public
</I>&gt;<i> indeed, preferably attached to legal language placing the text of the
</I>&gt;<i> claim in a safe domain (such as AMQP WG, FSF, or Public).  The fact
</I>&gt;<i> that this was not done, raises questions about Red Hat business
</I>&gt;<i> practice and casts doubt on their motives.  I suppose for now we shall
</I>&gt;<i> all draw our own conclusions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that Red Hat come clean about their intentions and help to
</I>&gt;<i> defuse any FUD.  I do believe they are sincerely committed to the
</I>&gt;<i> existing Working Group contracts and would like to see them defend
</I>&gt;<i> open standards in the future.  Note that I use 'open standard'
</I>&gt;<i> advisedly -- the situation here is very different from the OIN patent
</I>&gt;<i> portfolio which is designed to protect Linux.  There is no notion of
</I>&gt;<i> interop for Linux, at least nothing like AMQP interop.  The approaches
</I>&gt;<i> used by the W3C and IETF are more appropriate here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How does this effect RabbitMQ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently not at all.  We shall work to make sure that it never does
</I>&gt;<i> and expect to be able to report a suitable guarantee on behalf of the
</I>&gt;<i> Working Group as soon as possible.  There are a number of ways to do
</I>&gt;<i> this, none of which are terribly difficult, and people in the Working
</I>&gt;<i> Group are working as a group to make it happen and do so unambiguously
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  What about the overall effect on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adoption of AMQP?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that scaring users and implementers is good for AMQP
</I>&gt;<i> adoption.  This gives Red Hat, and everyone else, a strong incentive
</I>&gt;<i> to sort out the mess they have caused.  Then we can all move on,
</I>&gt;<i> probably stronger for the experience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know if this helps,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alexis Richardson,
</I>&gt;<i> RabbitMQ
