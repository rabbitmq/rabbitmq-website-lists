<PRE>Alexis,

&gt;<i> Thanks so much for talking about this.
</I>
It's my pleasure.  RabbitMQ and AMQP in general has worked its way in to
our normal tool chain, because they just work so well and fit a need
we've had for some time.

&gt;<i> When you say &quot;if we could..&quot; do you plan to it and/or do you 
</I>&gt;<i> require help?
</I>
The problem on my side is the scope of the changes (the internals of
RabbitMQ, all of the libraries, etc).  I don't really have the time to
devote to such a huge undertaking alone, but I suppose one of the
benefits of open source is collaborative development and this topic
seems to have a lot of interest.

&gt;<i> Would a custom exchange be useful here?
</I>
I'm betting so, but I want to (right now) avoid customizing our AMQP
broker to the extreme, I want to do what I can with the stock
server/client and decide from there if something custom would be a
better/cleaner approach.

&gt;<i> Very cool!  I am extremely impressed.  Do you plan to blog about this?
</I>
I hadn't thought about that, but it might be pretty useful for other
people once we get further along.

Thanks,
Rob
