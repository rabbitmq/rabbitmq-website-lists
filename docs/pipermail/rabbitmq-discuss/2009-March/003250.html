<PRE>Hi, Chuck,

Indeed, I remember the day it came out, and blogged about it:
<A HREF="http://kirkwylie.blogspot.com/2009/01/extprot-very-cool-idea.html">http://kirkwylie.blogspot.com/2009/01/extprot-very-cool-idea.html</A> .

However, there hasn't benen that much of a takeup on the other
language front, and while OCaml and Ruby are all very well and good,
but without your big 3 languages (C++, C#, Java), it's of limited use.
And it doesn't look like the author's necessarily interested in
pushing it to a much wider audience by making it a general purpose
encoding system with multi-language bindings. Because my background is
in financial services (where there's some F# going on, but very little
Ruby and OCaml), I think we probably have something to add there.

That being said, my plan was ultimately to have a reasonable amount of
interchange with other system (so that you can use .proto files to
define a schema, or an extprot definition, or even an XSD). So I want
to learn from what he's done and see where I can learn from what the
extprot guys have done.

Good find, though, it's right up the alley: self describing, delimited, fast.

Kirk
