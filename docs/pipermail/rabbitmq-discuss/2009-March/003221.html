<PRE>Matthias,

Good news, as you expected, it was something I was doing.  There was a Thread.yield() in a loop, which would have caused the extra system time.  All is well with RabbitMQ, as you assumed.  Sometimes it takes a second opinion, I just hate to waste your time being that. :)

&gt;<i>From my previous email, does the Qos work like I describe?  If messages are marked immediate but the client's queue is over Basic.Qos setting, the server will silently drop the delivery?
</I>
Also, I have looked through the AMQP lists a little bit and saw some discussion of a compressed or binary wire format, specifically relating to market quotes.  It looks like this is slated for 1.0, but that would be ideal for me (since AMQP overhead is ~30-50% of my message size now).  Is there a roadmap to adoption?

Thank you,
Rob

&gt;<i> Looks fairly sane. The connection thread sits exactly where you'd expect 
</I>&gt;<i> it to be when not much is happening on the connection, namely in a 
</I>&gt;<i> socketRead0. There are a whole bunch of non-rabbit threads though, 
</I>&gt;<i> including UI threads. It would be good to eliminate those from our 
</I>&gt;<i> enquiries.
</I>
