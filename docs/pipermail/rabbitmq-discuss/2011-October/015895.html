<PRE>Hi Bill,

Another possible approach is to publish all jobs for each customer to
their own queue. This gives you the opportunity to allocate resources
more fairly, but it does entail a bit more complexity. You will still
need to publish job notifications in a master jobs queue, to enable
workers to find the customer-specific queues.

</I>
I'm not sure how common that is, because it sounds very specific to the
needs of your application.

&gt;<i> My question is how to handle failures and detect stale jobs.  For
</I>&gt;<i> example, what if the first worker dies and never sends the completed (or
</I>&gt;<i> failed) message to the second worker?  The database is then left
</I>&gt;<i> indicating &quot;pending&quot;.   I would tend to use cron for this. That is, have
</I>&gt;<i> cron look for old &quot;pending&quot; states and either re-queue the request or
</I>&gt;<i> mark it as failed (say after a few failed retry attempts).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are there other approaches I should consider?
</I>
You could use acknowledgements. Workers should only acknowledge a job
once it is complete. If the worker fails before completion and drops the
connection to the broker then unacknowledged messages will be requeued
for other workers to pick up.
