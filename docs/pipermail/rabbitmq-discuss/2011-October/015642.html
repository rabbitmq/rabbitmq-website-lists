Just to be clear, we are still talking about the federation exchange, right?

&gt;<i> I've set it up and have messages published to a local exchange being

</I>&gt;<i> broker is down there's no local queuing of messages until it comes

That should really be happening. I am assuming your local exchange is 
the upstream and the central exchange is the downstream. When the 
downstream connects to the upstream it should create a queue (with a 
name beginning &quot;federation: &quot; on the upstream. Can you see this in mgmt 
/ rabbitmqctl? Of course, if you use the queue_expires parameter the 
upstream queue will expire eventually.

&gt;<i> Of course, maybe I am just designing my topology wrong. Maybe instead
</I>&gt;<i> of separate exchanges per application I should just have one exchange,
</I>&gt;<i> shoveled out to the remote exchange and then multiple queues bound to
</I>&gt;<i> that exchange. The exchange per app was going to make things

</I>&gt;<i> effecient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe the federation plugin includes a backing queue that can be
</I>&gt;<i> switched on or am I  missing something?
</I>
It is always on - even if the downstream does not disconnect then the 
upstream might publish messages faster than they can get sent across the 
link.

Cheers, Simon
