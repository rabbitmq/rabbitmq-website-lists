<PRE>This works (below). My confusion was over the relationship between 'name' and 'props' in the sample

/api/bindings/some_vhost/e/some_exchange/q/some_queue/name/some_pattern 

Thanks,
Helena

Subject: RE: Query for Binding with similar topic routing keys returns all similar vs the one matching

Perhaps my query is wrong but the docs are not specific in how to format the pattern for props: /api/bindings/vhost/e/exchange/q/queue/props

I tried a few such as:
/api/bindings/vhost/e/exchange/q/queue/{&quot;routing_key&quot;:&quot;my_routing_key&quot;,&quot;arguments&quot;:[]}
/api/bindings/vhost/e/some_exchange/q/some_queue/some_pattern

Can you offer a sample perhaps to explicitly pass this where props go?

Thanks,
Helena

Subject: Query for Binding with similar topic routing keys returns all similar vs the one matching

Hi,

Given
/api/bindings/vhost/e/exchange/q/queue/props    An individual binding between an exchange and a queue.

I find that if I create multiple bindings of different but similar patterns between Q1 and E1, say foo.bar.* and #.bar.*, that when querying the broker via http mgmt api to GET one binding between Q1 and E1 where the pattern I pass in is foo.bar.*, that I get 2 bindings back vs one, foo.bar.* and #.bar.*, which makes sense but it would be nice if the mgmt api returned only the one I requested, i.e. the binding foo.bar.*

Bug? or am I misinterpreting?

Thanks,
Helena
