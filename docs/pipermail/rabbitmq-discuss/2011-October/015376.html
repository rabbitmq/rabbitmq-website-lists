<PRE>Okay, thanks.

I'm trying to chase down why I'm not seeing all the events I've
published, in a test that shuts down the master node while events are
being produced.  Am trying to understand what I might be doing wrong.
Good to know that I can rely on robust publisher confirms!

I've pruned the test back to a very simple thing now.  I have two
nodes in the cluster.

1. With both nodes running, I produce an event.
2. I verify that I can consume this event.  I verify that I get a
publisher confirmation from the broker.
3. Using Alice, I stop the master node.
4. I produce another event.
5. I verify that I can consume this event.

I'm not seeing the event from step 5.  I wonder if I'm not properly
setting up the consumer?

When I stop the master node in step 3, I see the consumer catch a
ShutdownSignalException, with &quot;reason:
{#method&lt;connection.close&gt;(reply-code=320,
reply-text=CONNECTION_FORCED - broker forced connection closure with
reason 'shutdown'&quot;.  The consumer reconnects to the broker,
successfully as far as I can tell.

When I try to produce another event in step 4, the producer also
catches a ShutdownSignalException, with &quot;clean connection shutdown;
reason: Attempt to use closed channel&quot;.  The producer also reconnects
to the broker, successfully as far as I can tell.

After the producer reconnects, I see it succeed in basicPublish().  I
also see a publish confirmation from the broker for this event.

However, the consumer is never seeing it.

Q1: Is it surprising that the producer sees this in step 4?  I assumed
that it would be the same for the producer as for the consumer; if the
master node goes down, both sides must reconnect to the broker?

Q2: I think I am asking for consumer cancellation notification in the
consumer, but I never see the callback happen.  Should I expect to, in
the scenario I've outlined above?  I'm now a little concerned I'm not
setting it up properly, and this is why my consumer never sees this
event.  Here's the Java code that I use, which is in a class that
derives from RabbitMQ's ConnectionFactory.

   public DerivedConnectionFactory() {
      super();

      ...

        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; clientProperties = new HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;();
        clientProperties.put(
               &quot;consumer_cancel_notify&quot;,
                Boolean.valueOf(true)
                );
        this.setClientProperties(clientProperties);
   }

Thanks, --Steve
