When you say the message appears to be dispatched, how did you determine
this? Does &quot;rabbitmqctl list_queues&quot; report the queue to be non-empty?
You should also confirm that &quot;rabbitmqctl list_bindings&quot; and
&quot;rabbitmqctl list_consumers&quot; return the expected results and don't
change throughout the period of your test.

Can you reproduce the problem when only a single consumer is subscribed
to the queue? Can you confirm that no consumers retrieve messages
synchronously? I would suggest trying to reproduce the problem with a
minimal client implementation.

Are there any entries in the broker logfile at the time when you expect
the message goes missing?

Have you tried to reproduce the problem while registering a return
listener and publishing messages with the mandatory or immediate flags
turned on?
