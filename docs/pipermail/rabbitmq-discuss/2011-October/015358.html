Looks like the queues couldn't keep up with the inbound publishing rate, 
so rabbit ended up buffering messages in the channel.

...which is another indication of the above.

Well, obviously rabbit cannot process messages at an infinite rate, so 
clearly there has to be a limit ;)

However, 700Hz sounds quite low. On my desktop I can get more than 20 
times that. But there are many factors which can reduce that rate:
- persistent messages
- large messages
- routing messages to lots of queues
- using transactions
- having lots of consumers with basic.qos prefetch
etc.
