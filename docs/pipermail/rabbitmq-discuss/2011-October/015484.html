So my first goal was to learn more about the Rabbit's internal APIs. Besides that I haven't conducted any benchmarks to see what could be the advantage of using Bitcask over ETS.

According to the Basho devs they wanted to achieve this out of Bitcask:

- low latency per item read or written
- high throughput, especially when writing an incoming stream of random items
- ability to handle datasets much larger than RAM w/o degradation
- crash friendliness, both in terms of fast recovery and not losing data
- ease of backup and restore
- a relatively simple, understandable (and thus supportable) code structure and data format
- predictable behavior under heavy access load or large volume 
- a license that allowed for easy default use in Riak

From those items I think that the ability to handle datasets much larger than RAM w/o degradation could be an advantage over ETS. Still&#8230; If I understand correctly the datastore implementation I think when Rabbit start to get pressure on RAM usage it does some flushes to disk. Perhaps there could be a benefit there&#8230; not sure.

What I liked from this experiment is that there's no much code needed to have a different index implementation. Basho also created a LevelDB Erlang/C++ NIF, I think that can also be made a index quite easy. I've created a wrapper for it for the umbrella but didn't had time to also implement the index behaviour.

</I>
Yes&#8230; in my plugin I'm using the rabbit_boot_step thing to set my plugin as the default index.

Cheers,

Alvaro
