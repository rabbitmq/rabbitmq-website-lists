As the chosen slave becomes the master, no messages that are published 
to the mirrored-queue during this time will be lost: messages published 
to a mirrored-queue are always published directly to the master and all 
slaves. Thus should the master fail, the messages continue to be sent to 
the slaves and will be added to the queue once the promotion of a slave 
to the master completes.

Similarly, messages published by clients using publisher confirms will 
still be confirmed correctly even if the master (or any slaves) fail 
between the message being published and the message being able to be 
confirmed to the publisher.
&lt;/quote&gt;
