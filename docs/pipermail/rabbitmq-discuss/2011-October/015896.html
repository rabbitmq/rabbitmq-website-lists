If that was always true then it would not be possible for a queue to
ever get shorter. In the general case it should be possible for
consumers to catch up with producers.

Rabbit internally allocates RAM in a way that favours fast moving
queues, and is more likely to place messages from slow moving queues on
disk. Your description sounds somewhat similar.

&gt;<i> My question is: would another RabbitMQ broker be appropriate &quot;durable

</I>&gt;<i> structure, it seems to have many characteristics that are different from
</I>&gt;<i> a typical queue: very large footprint, very low throughput, very few
</I>&gt;<i> consumers.
</I>
If you have distinct streams of messages that have different
requirements and characteristics then you should consider using
different brokers. From your description some messages are
time-insensitive. If you want to provide better guarantees that
time-sensitive messages are processed quickly then you should consider a
dedicated broker with adequate RAM.
