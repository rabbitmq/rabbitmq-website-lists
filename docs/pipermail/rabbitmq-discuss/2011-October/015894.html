The problem with having your admin user subscribe to everything in the 
general case is how it should know that a new exchange has appeared. 
There are some solutions to this but then you have a race between the 
exchange being declared and the admin user binding to it.

Of course, depending on your topology this may not be a problem - there 
may be a fixed set of exchanges for example.

If this *is* a problem then maybe the firehose could be what you're 
looking for:

although your admin app would have to unpack the messages it produces 
slightly.
