<PRE>Hi,

The .net library supports multiple protocols, including AMQP 0-8.
Brokers supporting 0.8 have the ability to redirect connections and for
clients to attempt connections to a list of brokers. Much of this
support was dropped from the .net client when the broker reached 0-9-1,
in particular, it is only possible to specify a single target broker.

&gt;<i> Or is there a better way? We can certainly solve this by catching

</I>
Rabbit client libraries leave room for improvement in this regard,
especially with the introduction of high availability
(<A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html</A>) on the broker. The approach you
suggest sounds like a reasonable one to take at present.
