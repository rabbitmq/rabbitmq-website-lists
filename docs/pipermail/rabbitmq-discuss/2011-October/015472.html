<PRE>Matthias,

Given the following precondition:
Bindings exist that routing keys such as #.foo.bar and *.foo.bar would match.
Where objOption is the Option returned from GET /api/bindings/vhost/e/exchange/q/queue/routingKey  which unfortunately is either a binding or an array of bindings matching the #etc pattern

Case 1: If I pass in binding pattern #.foo.bar, I get an array of Bindings
Case 2: If I pass in binding pattern *.foo.bar, I consistently get a single matching Binding

Here is what I am doing, in scala, where I want to extract one binding given one pattern (routing key).

if (objOption.isDefined) objOption.get match {
   
   case bindings: Array[Binding] =&gt; for { b &lt;- bindings if b.getRoutingKey == pattern } binding = b

   case b: Binding =&gt; binding = objOption.get.asInstanceOf[Binding] 
}
 

Helena

Helena,

So do you think there is something broken there in rabbit? Or perhaps
less obvious than it could be? If so, an example of the form &quot;I tried X
and was expecting to see Y but instead got Z&quot; would help to shed light
on the problem.

Matthias.
