Hi Andy,
 
The exchange to exchange binding is IMHO the way to go.  You can create &quot;user&quot; exchanges bound to the origin exchange(s) with the binding keys that you require and temp Qs that bind to the &quot;user&quot; exchanges...

All,

I'm new to Queuing so please be patient.

I'm trying to build an app to support the following scenario.

We have a database with keys like

state.zipcode.itemtype.details  as new items are entered we want all subscribers to get the data. 

A person can subscribe using wildcards(# or *) in any of the positions. 

For instance given the following data entry keys

ny.12345.vehicles.cars  
ny.12346.boats.jetskies
tn.37775.vehicles.trucks

We want many subscribers to have the ability to create a filters like ny.#.cars to get all cars in NY. Or  they may want to say  #.jetskies or ny.*.boats.# etc etc.. anyways end users need the ability to create complex filters.

The hard part is with a topic exchange/queue only one subscriber is going to get an item when it hits the exchange/queue. I really need a combination of topic + fanout.

Can I create the exchange as a topic and route it to another fanout exchange where the end user is a queue?  Does the ruby amqp gem support exchange to exchange bindings?

Did any of that even make sense?  :D

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Andy
