<PRE>Hi All,

Is there a limit on the number of distinct bindings a consumer can establish when binding a queue to a topic exchange with a binding key?

It's my understanding, based on what I've learned here, that if a publisher publishes a message to an exchange and outbound from that exchange there is no binding, then the broker will simply discard the message. If there's no one listening (as it were) at the time of publication, then no one gets the message.

Around this phenomenon arises the question of somehow determining that there's an active consumer before publishing a message. The use case here is that these messages represent tasks that need to be run by the consumer. Perhaps these messages will be written by some kind of task scheduler. The point is that I don't want to publish the messages unless I know that a consumer is present and can act upon them.

I suppose this is where the &quot;mandatory&quot; flag comes in. But I'm wondering if there's a way to query  the broker about its infrastructure, e.g., the existence of a queue/binding that would indicate the presence of the consumer.

Thank you.

-Paul
