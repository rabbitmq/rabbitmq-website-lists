What are you trying to accomplish?  If you're creating a new exchange to publish
messages, then the blocking is sensible, since rabbit has blocked the connection
because it can't process you're messages fast enough anyway.

If you want to manage resources, you might want to keep a connection dedicated
to that for situations like that.

No, for the connection to be blocked simply means that rabbit stops reading from
the socket, so there is no easy way to detect that.
