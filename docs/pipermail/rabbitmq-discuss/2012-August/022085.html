You can set up the timeout yourself, for example by spawning a thread that will
try to do some operation and terminating it if it doesn't complete after a
certain amount of time.

I don't maintain the C# client (and I don't know much about C# either) but
introducing support for such a thing in the library would be quite a big change
and I don't it's going to happen.
