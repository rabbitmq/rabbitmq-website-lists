<PRE>You we're right!!!!! absolutely right!! Thank you very much, that was the
problem. I'm going to explain how I did the checkout so other people can
avoid make this mistake:

First I did: hg clone <A HREF="http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-public-umbrella/">http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-public-umbrella/</A>
Then: cd rabbitmq-public-umbrella
next: hg checkout rabbitmq_v2_8_5
next:  make co

And that's it, I thought that when this all the projects inside the
rabbitmq-public-umbrella
would be from the same tag/branch, but apparently they don't, so you have
to enter in the rabbitmq-server and do hg checkout rabbitmq_v2_8_5

I really appreciate the time you devote to this.

&gt;<i> Let me check.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the throttling:
</I>&gt;<i> It's a temporary solution, I'd like to try to do good one with credit
</I>&gt;<i> flow, but later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It preserves the order in what they arrive, so when a message for the
</I>&gt;<i> exchange Test1 arrives a process is spawned with a timeout, the next
</I>&gt;<i> message for the same exchange takes into that time, so it calculates its
</I>&gt;<i> timeout basing on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About the rate limit with multiple concurrent publishers, why not? It
</I>&gt;<i> stores the next timeout in a transaction, so the next message should
</I>&gt;<i> calculate its timeout taking into account the previous message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and thanks for the answers, they're very helpful for  understanding how
</I>&gt;<i> rabbitmq works.
