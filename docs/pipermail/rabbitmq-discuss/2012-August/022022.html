<PRE>Hi Sharon.

There isn't a hard coded limit of course, but ~10M queues sounds 
optimistic, especially if combined with ~10M TCP connections.

I don't think 1) and 2) are all that different. Unless you need the 
wildcard matching of a topic exchange you might as well pick a direct 
exchange.

But in both cases you have millions of connections / consumers / queues. 
That *is* quite a lot to support on one machine. Are all these consumers 
going to connect simultaneously? You may have trouble raising the fd 
limit that high.

Also each connection / consumer / queue will take a few kb of memory 
even when idle - so that could eat up quite a few GB before you do anything.

My gut feeling is that supporting that many simultaneous connections 
will be a problem before the raw number of queues is.

Cheers, Simon

</I>&gt;<i> nearly empty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Have one topic-exchange with (how many?) queues.  the unique id will be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which is the best solutions (or perhaps a third option)?  any other
