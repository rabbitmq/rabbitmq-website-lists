Looking at the end of the log, at approx. 10:51:55 one of the nodes are shut
down, and in the management interface I see that the shovel reconnects to the
other node. About 30 seconds later I start it up again, nothing seems to be
logged at this time. (The last entry in the log is my producer client manually
disconnecting)

&gt;<i> Also, just to clarify: those logs are from the single node that acts as a source

</I>
Yes, that is correct.

I took a look at the bug and I can see a lot of network errors - and this
matches the fact that your connection is unreliable.  Could you provide a
timeline of events, so that I can interpret the logs more easily?

Also, just to clarify: those logs are from the single node that acts as a source
for the shovel, and the shovel itself lives on that node, right?
