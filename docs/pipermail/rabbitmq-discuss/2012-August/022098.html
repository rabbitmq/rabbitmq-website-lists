<PRE>Hi Matthias,

Can you please post the logs and `rabbitmqctl report'?  It's almost impossible
to help you without those.

Could you also try to reproduce the issue with less things going on (e.g. only
one queue) and describe in detail what you're doing to trigger the problem?
Thanks.

There weren't any HA related leaks fixed in 2.8.6, so I don't think upgrading
will fix the problem.  However it would make our work much easier, so please
upgrade if you can.
