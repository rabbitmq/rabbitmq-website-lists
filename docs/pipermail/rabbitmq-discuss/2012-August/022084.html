If the CreateModel timed out instead, or threw an exception if it couldn't
establish a connection that would be the ideal situation. As it is I'm left
with a thread just sitting there blocked, when I try to stop the windows
service that this is running in it will just sit there...for a very long
time because it can't clean this up. The channel would be used to publish
new messages. 

My app is a REST service that is called to enqueue a message, but what is
happening is that the http request will never get a response due to the
channel being blocked...

I would agree blocking makes sense, but having an overload which takes a
timeout parameter would make my life a whole lot easier!
