As noted in my analysis, the bug has nothing do with the shovel, or 
consuming/acking - simply publishing to HA queues when (re)starting 
slaves is sufficient to trigger it.

I don't think it's worth the hassle. I am quite certain that you are 
suffering from the same bug.

Pause all publishing before (re)starting any cluster nodes.

Regards,

Matthias.
