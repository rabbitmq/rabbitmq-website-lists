<PRE>Hi Matthias,

My system is Windows 2008 Server 64-bit which has 24 GB RAM installed.
Erlang is a 32-bit version.

We had out-of-memory crash before with default HWM (40% - 800 MB).

Since Erlang VM has /LARGEADDRESSAWARE flag set, which implies it can
use up to 4 GB on a 64-bit Windows, we increased HWM to 1.6 GB.
As I pointed out in my previous email, RMQ detects 2GB as the maximum
usable memory in my case, we have to use 80% to set HWM to 1.6 GB.

The memory usage in crash dump may not be trustable. 
I had seen an out-of-memory crash dump before, indicating that Erlang
failed to allocate 1.4 GB of memory.


Best regards,
--Bin Chen

Is that the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Erlang? If the former then
please switch to the latter.

&gt;<i> The high memory watermark was set to 1.6 GB. See the attached picture.
</I>
When you say &quot;set&quot;, do you mean you changed it from the default values?

1.6GB at the default threshold of 40% would imply a detected usable
memory of 4GB, but the crash dump indicates that Erlang failed to
allocate ~40Mb of memory when it had just 2.6GB already allocated. So
either
- the usable system memory was detected incorrectly, or
- the memory HWM was increased from the default, or
- other applications are using the memory, or
- the crash dump significantly underreported the memory usage

Regards,

Matthias.
