I took a look at the bug and I can see a lot of network errors - and this
matches the fact that your connection is unreliable.  Could you provide a
timeline of events, so that I can interpret the logs more easily?

Also, just to clarify: those logs are from the single node that acts as a source
for the shovel, and the shovel itself lives on that node, right?
