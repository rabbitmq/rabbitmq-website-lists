I think you are simply pushing rabbit beyond the limit of its 
capability. Internal flow control happens on a per-process-link basis, 
so when you increase the number of publishing channels that corresponds 
to a linear increase in the amount of internal buffer space that is 
potentially required. To the point where all memory is taken up by 
messages sitting in these buffers.

Publishing across nodes carries an extra cost, so the buffers will fill 
up at lower publishing rates.

If with 50 producer connections x 1 channel you see most connections 
flowed, then that is an indications that rabbit is already operating at 
capacity but is still able to keep overall memory use under control. 
Adding more producer connections/channels will not increase the 
sustainable sending rate but will degrade rabbit's ability to control 
memory use.


Btw, I suggest you upgrade to the latest rabbit version - the flow 
control code has changed somewhat and there have been some performance 
improvements.

Regards,

Matthias.
