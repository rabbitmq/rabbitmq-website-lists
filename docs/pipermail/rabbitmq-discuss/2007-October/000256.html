<PRE>Joe,
 
Have a look at the way the RpcClient works in the java client - it sets
a response queue up for RPC requests that it registers itself as a
consumer for, i.e. at the transport layer it is asynchronous, but from
the client's perspective it is synchronous because it effectively does a
blocking receive.
 
HTH,
 
Ben 

	Can you have RabbitMQ work in synchronous mode?  For example, a
message put in a queue by the client(client waits for processing server
to return)  and one of the processing server picks up work, process it
and sends a reply back to the client.
