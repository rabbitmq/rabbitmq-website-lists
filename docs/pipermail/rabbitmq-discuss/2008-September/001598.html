<PRE>&gt;<i> BTW, you will most likely get better results with a consumer as
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to polling the queue.
</I>
Yeah, it sort of seemed like that's the desired way to use the system.
 I assume setting no_ack in basic_consume will let me acknowledge the
consumed message and create new ones in a transaction.  Where are
things like the no_ack option on py-amqplib's basic_consume
documented?

&gt;<i> Almost. The queue process will try to deliver the message to a waiting
</I>&gt;<i> consumer before it decides to buffer it in a message queue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is why it is cooler to have consumers rather than polling the queue.
</I>
Ok, that makes sense.

&gt;<i> Well it does deal with backlogs and it won't accept responsibility for
</I>&gt;<i> a message it can't deliver (if you ask it behave in this way).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just said that it is currently memory bound and doesn't overflow to disk
</I>&gt;<i> yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what do you do when you disk or SAN fills up?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every resource is finite.
</I>
That is true, but with a 32-bit process, memory is a ton more
constrained than drive space, especially on the machines we use :-)

&gt;<i> Why not process it during the day as well?
</I>
Well, it does process all day as well, but some machines need all
night to work on their backlogs.  Some machines are very busy...

&gt;<i> Pluggable queues will allow you implement custom queue behaviour
</I>&gt;<i> without having to hack on the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We want pluggable queues for a variety of use cases, and one
</I>&gt;<i> particular one is to be able to cleanly implement disk overflow
</I>&gt;<i> without hacking too much on the core of Rabbit. We try to reduce the
</I>&gt;<i> server codebase to a minimum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If somebody shouts loud enough, we might shift it up the list of
</I>&gt;<i> things to do, but remember, this is open source software. Either wait,
</I>&gt;<i> ask very nicely, fix it yourself or pay somebody to implement it for
</I>&gt;<i> you :-)
</I>
Yup, those are the options :-)  Is there a plan for pluggable queues,
or is it just a dive in and write it sort of thing?  It looks like all
the behaviour of a queue is in rabbit_amqqueue_process right now, and
the persistence of queues is in rabbit_persister.  Would just
replacing the queue (message_buffer) in rabbit_amqqueue_process with a
file-backed object work for what I'm doing?  Persistence is still
handled by rabbit_persister for when things die, but a file-backed
queue wouldn't have to use so much system memory.  Is there a problem
with doing it that way?
