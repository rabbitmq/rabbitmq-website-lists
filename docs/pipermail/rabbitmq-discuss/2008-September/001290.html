<PRE>Matthias,
Hi. I'm new to RabbitMQ and this list, so you may know this already
but...

Red has produced a paper recently (June 2008) explaining its performance
testing lab that it did recently to show how optimised Red Hat on Intel
Xeon hardware can process very high message rates:
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/f/pdf/mrg/Reference_Architecture_MRG_Messaging_Thr">http://www.redhat.com/f/pdf/mrg/Reference_Architecture_MRG_Messaging_Thr</A>
oughput.pdf 

This paper was presented at an Intel FasterCITY - fasterMESSAGING event
in London on 23 June.
<A HREF="http://www.intelfasterfs.com/fastermessaging/">http://www.intelfasterfs.com/fastermessaging/</A> 
It contains a description of the test bench it used to generate its
figures - which were a repeatable ingress rate of 380,000 (256 byte)
messages per second. There is obviously a lot more to it - see the paper
for details.

That could be a starter for ten.

Regards
Michael

I have mentioned our observations to a few folks, but, as you say, there

is no point in pursuing this further until we have solid, repeatable 
evidence. Now, our results *are* repeatable, but they are all in the 
context of RabbitMQ. To start a fruitful discussion on the Erlang list /

with the Erlang gurus we'd need to construct a simpler, standalone test 
exhibiting the same behaviour. In the process we may well discover the 
root cause of the problem ourselves.

Btw, one issue with performance testing of RabbitMQ is that it is really

difficult to measure the maximum throughput. RabbitMQ is a message 
*queuing* system, and any test setup will have several message buffers 
at various levels - the OS's network stack at the test client and 
RabbitMQ server, various process message queues at the server and 
buffers in the test client, and the queue processes at the server. 
Optimum throughput is achieved when all these buffers contain just the 
right amount of data so that the processing hanging off them never has 
to wait for data and yet no data is buffered unnecessarily. There are 
lots of tweakable parameters that affect buffering in the OS, the 
Erlang/Java VM, and the client/server apps. Furthermore, due to jit-ing 
and variations in scheduling decisions (by the VMs and the OS) the 
optimal settings shift over time.

As others have discovered, if a test just blasts messages at RabbitMQ, 
the broker will likely start queuing up most of them, consume increasing

amounts of memory, and eventually grind to a halt. To get a sensible max

throughput measurement a more sophisticated approach is required that 
controls and adapts the sending rate to the prevailing conditions.

We'd love to get the help of the community to put together a really 
simple &quot;run this and it will report the maximum throughput&quot; test 
program. Initially this can be for just the simplest (and fastest) 
routing scenario - single producer, single consumer (running in the same

OS process if that is convenient), single queue, direct exchange, 
auto-ack basic.consume.

Note that this test app would work against all AMQP brokers, not just 
RabbitMQ, so could be used for performance comparison.

Any takers?


Matthias.
