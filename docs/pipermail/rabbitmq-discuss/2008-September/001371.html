<PRE>Ben,

This would of great value. As indicated in my previous mail, we should
&gt;<i> promote the client, so this refactoring work should go into the core
</I>&gt;<i> build and release process. Because of the centrality of this work, we
</I>&gt;<i> may need to consider effects that it would have on the core process.
</I>&gt;<i> The various parts of Rabbit have already been broken out into separate
</I>&gt;<i> hg repos, which for practical purposes, need to be checked to sibling
</I>&gt;<i> directories in order for the build to work (e.g. rabbitmq-server
</I>&gt;<i> expects rabbitmq-codegen to be checked out into the same parent
</I>&gt;<i> directory). This approach could be taken for a common Erlang module.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's good - so it's not an alien procedure.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other consideration that you might make is how this patch gets
</I>&gt;<i> played back to the Rabbit dev team. You could generate a simple patch
</I>&gt;<i> or you could use hg as a DVCS. One consideration with the latter is
</I>&gt;<i> that we use named branches for each new feature or bug. If you were
</I>&gt;<i> just to clone and implement this in the default branch of your repo,
</I>&gt;<i> we may need to think about how to handle the history (because hg
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't rewrite it in the same way that git does).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't have any HG experience - it seems like there's now an explosion of
configuration management and source code control tools and I just can't keep
up :)
I will defer to your wisdom in these matters.


&gt;<i> But having said that I don't want to let any formalities get in the
</I>&gt;<i> way of you contributing to Rabbit, so at the end of the day, I would
</I>&gt;<i> do what is most convenient for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Maybe we can meet halfway. I didn't really want to get into rearchitecting
the RabbitMQ module structure (well, I wish I could, but I don't have time.
The mortgage payment beckons and all that incidental stuff).


&gt;<i> Apart from rabbit_amqqueue and rabbitmq_misc, all of those modules
</I>&gt;<i> were designed to be eventually sharable, so that is fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My gut feeling is that rabbit_amqqueue and rabbitmq_misc are purely
</I>&gt;<i> server side concerns and if there is a dependency there, we should
</I>&gt;<i> look at it and potentially factor it out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree. I said something like that in one of my other emails before I
replied to this one. One could put the factored-out code into the &quot;common&quot;
app.

Regards,
Edwin
