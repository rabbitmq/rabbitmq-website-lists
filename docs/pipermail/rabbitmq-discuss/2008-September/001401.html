<PRE>Hi Joe,

&gt;<i> First I wanted to thank you for this post
</I>
Glad I could help. I'll use it as feedstock for growing the README and
the wiki page (<A HREF="https://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/StompGateway">https://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/StompGateway</A>), too.

&gt;<i> Is this round-robin functionality predictable in terms of the order in
</I>&gt;<i> which a set of consumers subscribed to a single queue will be
</I>&gt;<i> notified?
</I>
It's not perfect. It will *usually* be a fairish round-robin, cycling
through consumers in a regular cycle. If anything happens, though, such
as the addition or removal of a consumer, or the rejection of an
individual message, or TCP flow-control kicking in, the order of
consumers can be shuffled. Usually the shuffling will be minor, but it
can in general be arbitrary.

&gt;&gt;<i> The &quot;id&quot; header should be some string unique to the current connection
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (!) which names the subscription. I've used a fresh GUID here, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything connection-unique is acceptable.
</I>&gt;<i> Would there be any argument against using some version of a GUID-style
</I>&gt;<i> browser session cookie here?  This would provide me with a nice
</I>&gt;<i> mapping to my web application as well, to help keep things organized.
</I>
No argument against that. So long as the &quot;id&quot; string there is unique to
the individual STOMP connection (socket), you're good to go.

&gt;<i> Thanks for this link, although maybe I should have looked harder for
</I>&gt;<i> the spec myself.  Instead I fruitlessly searched about the rabbitmq
</I>&gt;<i> site for 'fanout' and 'topic'.
</I>
We're working on improving the website and the wiki.

&gt;<i> Based on the AMQP spec it looks like a topic exchange is best suited
</I>&gt;<i> to my needs.  This provides the same basic functionality as the
</I>&gt;<i> fanout, but also provides added granularity in terms of determining
</I>&gt;<i> who gets what in a hierarchical fashion ( I guess it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily have to be hierarchical though ).
</I>
Yes. Note that fanout is a bit more efficient in the current implementation.

&gt;<i> Hmm.  From the AMQP spec it looks like I can create a 'durable'
</I>&gt;<i> exchange, which means that there shouldn't be any obstacle to creating
</I>&gt;<i> a hybrid producer client, right?  I am working primarily with python,
</I>&gt;<i> so I'm thinking I can use stomper+py-amqplib or python-qpid
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://barryp.org/software/py-amqplib/">http://barryp.org/software/py-amqplib/</A>) then just use amqp module to
</I>&gt;<i> add the exchange and do all my message passing with STOMP.
</I>
Absolutely. That sounds right to me.

Regards,
  Tony
