&gt;<i> - kernel settings matter, but not as much as one would think. My server
</I>&gt;<i> runs at 250 HZ &amp; voluntary preemption, whereas the laptop runs with full
</I>&gt;<i> preemption at 300 HZ - however both exhibit very similar symptoms, and I
</I>&gt;<i> strongly suspect you'd see the same at 1000 HZ or with the RT kernel
</I>&gt;<i> (still need to try that one). Keep in mind that different distributions
</I>&gt;<i> have patched kernels to varying degrees (especially RedHat) and that the
</I>&gt;<i> relatively new CFQ CPU scheduler (new in 2.6.23 IIRC) had a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> performance oddities since its introduction. My understanding from
</I>&gt;<i> following the kernel list most of these should be fixed in the current
</I>&gt;<i> 2.6.26 kernel, however the variance between the average (~1ms) and max.
</I>&gt;<i> latency (40ms) is IMHO just way too big for an occasional mis-schedule so
</I>&gt;<i> something else must be wrong. Besides we all get the same 40ms penalty so
</I>&gt;<i> that is a good sign that it's not the kernel scheduler per se.
</I>
I'll add one note, the Red Hat MRG RT kernel gives you a max scheduler 
latency of ~20us. The
Linux TCP stack can run with max latency sub 1ms with both 2.6.18 RHEL5 
and MRG RT
2.6.24. most of your issues are most likely nagle.

Carl.
