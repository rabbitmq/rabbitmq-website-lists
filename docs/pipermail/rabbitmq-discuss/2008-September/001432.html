I shouldn't think this makes a difference, but having said that, it
would be a good idea to test it.

We are always interested in relative performance comparisons from the
community (as long as they are tractable, that is).

(And show Rabbit off in a good light :-)

&gt;<i> I read your comments below with interest, and I

OK, so you are good for now?

Ben
