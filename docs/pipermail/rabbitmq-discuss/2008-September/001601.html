That depends on what state the messages in your backlog are in. The 
message_buffer only contains committed (when tx is used) messages that 
are not currently awaiting acknowledgement.

Messages that are part of a tx which hasn't committed yet, and messages 
which have been sent to a consumer but not yet acknowledged, are kept in 
tx/cr records in the process dictionary.

</I>
You'll need to think about how to &quot;garbage collect&quot; the files of your 
file-backed queue store in the event of server crash, perhaps by hooking 
a function into the RabbitMQ startup sequence that deletes them
