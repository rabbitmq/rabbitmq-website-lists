There maybe a few things one could to start eliminating things:

1. Run the broker on the same machine as the client, to eliminate any
possible network effects;

2. Test the broker across the network with a different Rabbit client,
e.g. Java, C# or Ruby client to verify that the setup does actually
work;

3. Debug into the onSocketConnect function in the Connection class
(either by setting a breakpoint add a trace statement). This is where
the AMQP header (the byte series 65,77,81,80,1,1,8,0 ) is written to
the peer socket. By doing this you are making sure that this function
is being invoked in the correct fashion. If you are not too familiar
with AS3, remember that it is single threaded so IO calls do not
block, every IO event has to handled asynchronously. If for example,
you haven't got an event handler set up properly, e.g. the socket
connect event, then the AMQP header won't get written out and the
server will just timeout (which is what you are seeing);

4. Because point 3 should be covered by library code that
a) is tested and known to work;
b) doesn't really need any attention from a high level API perspective
can you send me exactly the code that that you are using please? The
last time I got some code, it turned out that you had sent the wrong
code - maybe you can tar up the whole FB project that you are working
on.

HTH,

Ben
