when I ran it the server manually).
The thing is, that it might be related to erlsrv and its monitoring 
since erlsrv monitors the node and knows how to kill it and bring it back.

Other than that monitoring feature and as far as I could figure out, 
erlsrv is mostly good for monitoring the real node's process and I don't 
think that it should have (or do have) anything specific with this issue.

</I>The code is sent is the code (see it in the &quot;Error Code 541&quot; thread) is 
what I used here as well.
The file size was ~180Mb.
