<PRE>Ben,

Thanks so much for looking into this and giving it your consideration. I'm
happy that you found it of some value. I was a bit worried that you would
have concerns about the performance of the modified code, given that it's no
longer a direct module call. I read your comments below with interest, and I
am watching and learning. I'll be very curious to see the actual finished
code when it's released. I'm glad the direct driver problem was just a
commented-out line of code - I admit I did do it all in a hurry as a proof
of concept.

I have in the meantime created my own little rabbitmq_common application,
used only by the Erlang client, and it is all working famously and nicely
decoupled from the server. I trust that the changes you are talking about
will come out in the next release of RabbitMQ, so when that happens, I'll
change my code to use the &quot;official&quot; client and whatever the common app is
called.

Regards,
Edwin
