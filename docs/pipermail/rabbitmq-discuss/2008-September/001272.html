I've just had a look at your code, and it works for me :-(

But only after changing it to get it compile, which leads me to think
that you may have sent a different version to me and the list than the
actual mxml file that you are testing with.

Could you double check this, please?

For example, the variable &quot;sub&quot; is not defined (I assume that you
meant to use the subClient variable).

Also there is no import statement for the JSONSerializer.

So after changing these two things, I was able to sucessfully connect to Rabbit.

Your test, BTW, does not have a producer that sends anything that a
subscriber can listen to.

Maybe it would be an idea to start with the publish client, rather
than the subscribe client in order to get first things first.

HTH,

Ben
