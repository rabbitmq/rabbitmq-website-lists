Yes, I imagined this, I don't expect it to succeed when a queue is  
removed,
although this might change some things. What if I connect with an  
auto_delete queue
non durable and in the middle of a transaction I disconnect it? Of  
course one way would
be to simply leave the queue there, but at some point the mnesia db  
would be full.

Why? This is completely unexpected to me... Also I don't think this is  
true because
I don't see the connection dropped error on the client side that I  
usually see
when I stop rabbitmq server.

&gt;&gt;<i> I tried adding code that in case of a failed commit runs the rollback

</I>&gt;<i> Since the connection will have been closed there is no point in

Sure, it's just that dropping the connection because a transaction  
failed
makes the commit_failed message completely useless. Just use the
connection dropped error to mean the same thing, I'm not sure this is  
the
right behavior (from a logic point of view). If a database dropped the  
connection
every time a transaction failed they would spend more time off rather  
than doing
anything. That's why I think it's an error, after all transactions are  
isolated and
a rollback is there exactly to be able to go back to the beginning  
without any
consequences.

&gt;&gt;<i> but apparently I don't even receive the failed commit message.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is strange. What client are you using?
</I>

erlang client and rabbitmq server.
