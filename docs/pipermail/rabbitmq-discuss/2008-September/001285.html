<PRE>Mark

Thanks for getting back on this.

</I>
Excellent and yes we agree.  An analogy with RabbitMQ C# to Spring.NET
integration would be our WCF integration which is higher level and
provides Visual Studio integration too.  That is very much about
programming convenience.


&gt;<i> That said, I really don't know RabbitMQ so I'm not in the
</I>&gt;<i> best position now to suggest what the interface of the template class would
</I>&gt;<i> look like.
</I>
Understood.



&gt;<i> When I spoke with you at QCon a while ago (sorry for not following up on the
</I>&gt;<i> email after that) you suggested that developers from rabbitmq would be
</I>&gt;<i> interested in helping in the dev effort of spring support for rabbit-mq.
</I>
Yes, there have been a number of people asking about this on the
rabbitmq list and off list too.  Although, when I mentioned this at
QCon, I was thinking about Java-RabbitMQ primarily.  However, in the
same way that our Java and C# clients are very similar to each other,
any template work will most likely involve overlap between Java and
.NET.


&gt;<i> If
</I>&gt;<i> that is the case, then I suggest we can form a spring-extensions project and
</I>&gt;<i> start with a .NET implementation.
</I>
Would it be possible for the same project to be a home for both a .NET
implementation and a Java implementation?  (Pace your comments below)


&gt;<i> On the Java side there is so much momentum and developer mind-share around
</I>&gt;<i> the JMS API that I don't think a case can be made for including this in the
</I>&gt;<i> general spring framework.   I agree that for integration with Camel, Spring
</I>&gt;<i> Integration etc., there isn't a reason the native API should be used and
</I>&gt;<i> that use-case in itself isn't motivation to create template or other higher
</I>&gt;<i> level helper classes to RabbitMQ
</I>
Not sure I agree with this.  Connecting frameworks to Java clients
ought to be a walk in the park; at least that has been the case with
other products eg Mule.  Putting JMS in the middle seems to create
inconvenience.  But - what do other people think?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I can see two ways of implementing this. One is to use the existing AMQP

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> its maturity. The other one is to implement directly using the RabbitMQ
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> library
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think it would be most useful for users if the semantics of the AMQP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model were exposed via a Spring template, rather than just confining
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users to the semantics of JMS. This could make functionality available
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such configuring message routing that isn't available via JMS, for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An alternative route would be to say I want to keep the JMS template
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> semantics and then back the interface with the RabbitMQ java lib. Your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use case may be to provide migration without having to change client
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code. Some concepts might be mappable between JMS and AMQP, e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Connection(Factories), Sessions (Channels?) and Destinations (Queues),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but if you would have to bear in mind that this would probably not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pass a TCK, especially wrt transactions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At least initially, this second approach is strongly preferable in
</I>&gt;<i> being far easier to implement and manage IMO.  The creation of an
</I>&gt;<i> AMQPTemplate and suitable factories using the RabbitMQ Java client
</I>&gt;<i> would deliver the required integration.  These should follow the
</I>&gt;<i> example of the corresponding JMS tooling classes.  With this done then
</I>&gt;<i> other more generic integration could be thought about and then
</I>&gt;<i> achieved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for Camel, although I'm not an expert, isn't part of the value-add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of Camel be able to abstract away different message passing paradigms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and so therefore AMQP would be just another transport?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not an expert either but I agree with this and suspect the
</I>&gt;<i> pattern would be similar to that for other message based integration
</I>&gt;<i> toolkits such as Mule, which used the RabbitMQ Java client directly
</I>&gt;<i> without needing to go via JMS or Spring.  It was not much work at all.
