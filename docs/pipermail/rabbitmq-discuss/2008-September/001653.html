I think there is a lot of merit in the use cases you have described in
this mail.

Please understand that realms were not discarded because people didn't
want fine grained ACLs per se, just that they not particularly well
specified and hence very difficult to implement properly.

Certainly we would *like* to have some more fine grained AC that what
we currenly have. Something capability based would probably be nicer
than plain jane ACLs, but this would be subject to requirements and
design. In plain English, this could potentially go into the roadmap
at some stage.

If you would like to improve the chances of doing this, you could
start a community based initiative which would entail documenting use
cases and identifying potential solutions, eventually cutting some
code.

Otherwise you're going to have to be very persuasive to get this
bumped up the list of priorities :-)

Does anybody else have any views on access control?

HTH,

Ben
