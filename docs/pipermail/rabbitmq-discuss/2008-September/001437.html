<PRE>The reason we are using a message queue is to be able to send various 
messages to perform actions in an async manner.


I prefer not to lose these messages, hence the durable queue, but I can 
recover from not getting them.


The behavior I would expect, such as flowing back to the disk is to 
flush them to the disk and only keep a small portion in-memory, when 
&quot;the cows come home&quot; (or more exactly, the cowboy comes back and pushes 
the cows to their rightful place) it will start reading from the disk 
chunk by chunk until it reaches a point where all the backlog finished 
and from there it will go back to work as it was before.


Having that combined with a key that says when we should start throwing 
things directly to the disk without keeping them in memory (or without 
keeping them in memory too much) as well as a max queue length (depth, 
depends on where you look at it) would be really great.


Having the ability to write a queue plugin would be really great. There 
is always that 20% that requires a certain behavior that is not off the 
shelf :-)
