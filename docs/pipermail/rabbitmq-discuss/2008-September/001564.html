Sure, but I think these days people are going for 1.5PC instead of 2PC
- it's just a cost-benefit comparison.

</I>&gt;<i> Ok, so I need durable queues and will wait for the overflow on disk

</I>
Yes. AMQP is consumer driven, not producer driven.

&gt;&gt;<i> Yep. Don't know what the exact factor is though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ouch... I'll try later today or tomorrow to see what this value actually is

</I>
I shouldn't imagine that this will cost you an order of magnitude -
the persister is write-optimized after all, though it does have to
synchronously write to disk.

&gt;<i> They look OK in the sense that even persistent messages can reach those
</I>&gt;<i> rates?
</I>
I guess the IO bandwidth of your filesystem would be an important
factor in this equation.

&gt;&gt;<i> I think that you need to work out what ingress requirements you have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (this will be determined by the capacity of the http server) and what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> egress you need (so as to avoid stuff queuing up too much).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Remember that ATM Rabbit does not implement QoS, so your egress will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be bound by the slowest consumer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What if I have multiple consumers on a queue? Does speed scales almost
</I>&gt;<i> linearly?
</I>
No, because the current queue delivery mechanism takes a
robin-robin-ish approach, so the overall throughput is rate limited by
the slowest consumer subscribed to a queue.

This should be addressed when we implement QoS, which would take a
credit based approach that is determined by consumer acks.

If you are interested in the details of what is planned, there is a
design for it here: <A HREF="https://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/BasicQosDesign">https://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/BasicQosDesign</A>

As indicated before, there is no ETA on this feature.

Ben
