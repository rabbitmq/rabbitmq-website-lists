<PRE>The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 1.5.1.

This release has 'final' status and fixes a number of bugs in the
server, the .net client, and the Debian/RPM packaging.

For details see the attached release notes.

Binary and source distributions of the new release can be found in the
usual place, at <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html</A>

We recommend that all users of earlier versions of RabbitMQ upgrade to
this latest release.

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion
list at rabbitmq-discuss at lists.rabbitmq.com, or directly at
info at rabbitmq.com.


Regards,

The RabbitMQ Team

Release: RabbitMQ 1.5.1
Status : final

Release Highlights
==================

server
------
bug fixes
- handle race condition between routing and queue deletion that could
 cause errors on message publication
- the default settings for RABBITMQ_SERVER_ERL_ARGS were not taken
 into account, resulting in decreased network performance
- add workaround for the Erlang/OTP bug OTP-7025, which caused errors
 in topic routing in Erlang/OTP versions older than R12B-1
- display the nodes of queue and connection processes in rabbitmqctl's
 list_{queues,connections} command. Previously we displayed pids,
 which was broken and not particularly useful.

enhancements
- enable 'channel.flow'-based producer throttling by default on Linux
- include stack traces in error reports in rabbit.log
- speed up rabbitmqctl and rabbitmq-multi

Java client
-----------
no significant changes

.net client
-----------
bug fixes
- handle race condition in client-initiated connection closure that
 could result in an OperationInterruptedException

enhancements
- re-enable heartbeating by default

building &amp; packaging
--------------------
bug fixes
- fix bug that caused removal of RPMs to be incomplete
- produce separate RPMs for SuSE-like systems to resolve various
 incompatibilities
- rename BUILD to README in order to prevent build failures on systems
 with case-insensitive file naming (such as OS X)

enhancements
- minor tweaks in Debian and RPM packaging for better compliance with
 packaging guidelines
- better handling of errors encountered during code generation


Upgrading
=========

No special precautions are necessary when upgrading from
RabbitMQ-1.5.0.

When upgrading from earlier releases, note that the database schema
has changed in RabbitMQ-1.5.x. When the RabbitMQ server detects the
presence of an old database, it moves it to a backup location, creates
a fresh, empty database, and logs a warning.

If your RabbitMQ installation contains important data, such as user
accounts, durable exchanges and queues, or persistent messages, then
we recommend you contact <A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-announce">support at rabbitmq.com</A> for assistance with the
upgrade.
