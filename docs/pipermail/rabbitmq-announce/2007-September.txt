Subject: [rabbitmq-announce] RabbitMQ 1.2.0 released
Message-ID: <46FB9426.2010607@lshift.net>

The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 1.2.0.

This release has beta status and focuses on the following areas:

- internal flow control to prevent performance drops when running a 
server near capacity

- simplified cluster configuration. For details see 
http://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html

- some bug fixes and minor enhancements. For details see the attached 
release notes.

Binary and source distributions of the new release can be found in the

We recommend that all users of earlier versions of RabbitMQ upgrade to 
this latest release.

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on 
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and 
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion
