<PRE>
RabbitMQ v3.1.0 is significant because it introduces an important set of
new features, making Rabbit easier to use and manage. [1]

 - Eager synchronisation of mirror queue slaves
 - Automatic cluster partition healing
 - Improved statistics

V3.1.0 has significance for another reason: it is the first release made
under the banner of our new sponsor company, Pivotal.  Pivotal launched
earlier this year as a joint venture between VMware, EMC and with a
strategic partnership with General Electric Global Software.  Billed as
&quot;A New Platform for a New Era&quot;, the Pivotal platform will unite data,
application, and cloud fabrics. [2] The Rabbit team members are excited
to be part of this bold new initiative driving open source innovation
and collaboration.

RabbitMQ will continue to be available under the open source Mozilla
Public License [3] or commercial terms. Commercial support, consulting
and both self-paced and Instructor-led training courses are still
available worldwide. The rabbitmq-discuss mailing list [4] will continue
to be the primary channel of communication about open-source RabbitMQ.
The release cycle is not expected to change as a result of the change of
ownership.

We invite all customers to continue with us on the journey to become the
most reliable, scalable and portable messaging system.
