Subject: [rabbitmq-announce] RabbitMQ 1.5.4 release
Message-ID: <49D9EDF6.2050309@lshift.net>

The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 1.5.4.

This release has 'final' status and fixes a small number of bugs in the 
server, the startup and control scripts on Windows, and the Debian/RPM 
packaging. Also included are some minor enhancements to the way the 
server can be configured. The RabbitMQ clients have remained unchanged.

For details see the attached release notes.

Binary and source distributions of the new release can be found in the 
usual place, at http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html

We recommend that all users of earlier versions of RabbitMQ upgrade to 
this latest release.

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on 
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and 
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion 
list at rabbitmq-discuss at lists.rabbitmq.com, or directly at 
info at rabbitmq.com.


Regards,

The RabbitMQ Team
