The RabbitMQ team is delighted to announce the release of RabbitMQ 2.7.0.

New features in this release include:

 - plugins are included in the main rabbitmq-server release, with a new
   command, rabbitmq-plugins, to enable and disable them
 - clients accept a new "amqp" URI scheme for connections
 - significant performance improvements to connection creation, durable
   queues, message storage, and large numbers of consumers
 - thread-safe Java client consumer callbacks

See the attached release notes for more details.
