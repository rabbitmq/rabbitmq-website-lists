Subject: [rabbitmq-announce] RabbitMQ 3.2.0 released
Message-ID: <5267CF4A.5060903@rabbitmq.com>

The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 3.2.0.

This release introduces federated queues and features enhanced policies
for aspects of the broker which previously required AMQP arguments.
Clients can now obtain better feedback about authentication failures and
broker alarm conditions.

This release corrects a number of defects in the broker and plugins.
The minimum version of Erlang has been changed from R12B5 to R13B03. See
the release notes at:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/release-notes/README-3.2.0.txt

for more information.

The new release can be downloaded from:

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion
list.

Regards,
                      The RabbitMQ Team
