Subject: [rabbitmq-announce] RabbitMQ 2.8.0 released
Message-ID: <4F672049.1000108@rabbitmq.com>

The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ
2.8.0.

This release fixes a number of bugs and adds new features. Notable new 
features include:

     - dead lettering - queues can specify an exchange to which
       messages should be redirected when they are rejected or expire

     - internal flow control to limit memory use and make performance
       more predictable if the server is overloaded

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion
list.

Regards,
                The RabbitMQ Team
                (http://www.rabbitmq.com)
