<PRE>The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 2.6.0.

The highlight of this release is the introduction of active-active HA, 
with queues getting replicated across nodes in a cluster. There are many 
other improvements, particularly to the management and stomp plug-ins, 
as well as a number of bug fixes. See the attached release notes for 
more details.

Binary and source distributions of the new release can be found in the 
usual place at <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html</A>

We recommend that all users of earlier versions of RabbitMQ upgrade to 
this latest release.

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on 
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and 
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion 
list at <A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-announce">rabbitmq-discuss at lists.rabbitmq.com</A>, or directly at 
<A HREF="https://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-announce">info at rabbitmq.com.</A>

Regards,

The RabbitMQ Team
