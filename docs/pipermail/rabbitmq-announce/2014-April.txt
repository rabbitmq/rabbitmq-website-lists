Subject: [rabbitmq-announce] RabbitMQ 3.3.0 released
Message-ID: <533C226A.3010906@rabbitmq.com>

The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 3.3.0.

This release improves performance in a variety of conditions, adds 
monitoring information to identify performance bottlenecks, adds 
dynamically manageable shovels, and allows Java-based clients to 
reconnect automatically after network failure.

This release also corrects a number of defects in the broker and 
plugins, as well as introducing a host of smaller features. See the 
release notes at:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/release-notes/README-3.3.0.txt

for more information.

The new release can be downloaded from:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion
list.

Subject: [rabbitmq-announce] RabbitMQ 3.3.0: "guest" user changes
Message-ID: <533C2336.70502@rabbitmq.com>

This release changes the behaviour of the default "guest" user. 
Previously the guest user could be accessed from any network location. 
In RabbitMQ 3.3.0 and later, the guest user can only be accessed via 
localhost by default.

Any other users you create will not (by default) be restricted in this way.

See http://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html for more information.

Cheers, Simon
