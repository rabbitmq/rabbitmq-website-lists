Subject: [rabbitmq-announce] RabbitMQ 1.8.1 release
Message-ID: <4C3EDD34.8090206@rabbitmq.com>


The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 1.8.1.

This release of RabbitMQ can now be compiled with Erlang R14A. This is
expected to bring relief for MacPorts users and Debian (unstable) users
who build from source. Administration tools are now easier to use on
MacPorts. Further enhancements include the ability to observe
channel.flow events from the Java API and clustering usability improvements.

For details see the attached release notes.

Binary and source distributions of the new release can be found in the
usual place, at http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html

We recommend that all users of earlier versions of RabbitMQ upgrade to
this latest release.

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion
list at rabbitmq-discuss at lists.rabbitmq.com, or directly at
info at rabbitmq.com.


Regards,

The RabbitMQ Team
