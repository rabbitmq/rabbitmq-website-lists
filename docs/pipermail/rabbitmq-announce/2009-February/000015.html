<PRE>The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 1.5.3.

This release has 'final' status and fixes a number of bugs in the
server, the Java client, the .net client, and the Debian/RPM packaging.

For details see the attached release notes.

Binary and source distributions of the new release can be found in the
usual place, at <A HREF="http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html">http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html</A>

We recommend that all users of earlier versions of RabbitMQ upgrade to
this latest release.

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion
list at rabbitmq-discuss at lists.rabbitmq.com, or directly at
info at rabbitmq.com.


Regards,

The RabbitMQ Team

Release: RabbitMQ 1.5.3
Status : final

Release Highlights
==================

server
------
bug fixes
- prevent the shell from attempting to perform path expansion on vars
  in the startup scripts, which was resulting in errors when starting
  rabbit on some systems.
- make guid generation independent of persister, thus preventing
  timeouts when the persister is busy
- get scripts to source configuration from /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf
  rather than /etc/default/rabbitmq, since the latter is reserved for
  init.d scripts.

Java client
-----------
bug fixes
- eliminate race condition in server-initiated channel closure that
  could lead to deadlock

.net client
-----------
bug fixes
- eliminate race condition in server-initiated channel closure that
  could lead to deadlock

building &amp; packaging
--------------------
enhancements
- minor tweaks in Debian and RPM packaging for better compliance with
  packaging guidelines
- place wrapper scripts for rabbitmq-server and rabbitmq-multi
  alongside the rabbitmqctl wrapper in /usr/sbin
- do not start the server by default on RPM-based systems, in order to
  comply with common practice and guidelines
- suppress stdout in logrotate scripts, to keep cron et al happy

Upgrading
=========

The place from which the server startup and control scripts source
configuration information on Unix systems has changed from
/etc/default/rabbitmq to /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf. If you have been
using the former, just move the file to the latter location.  The
/etc/default/rabbitmq file (/etc/sysconfig/rabbitmq on RPM-based
systems) is still being sourced by the init.d script, but it should
only contain settings directly affecting the behaviour of the init.d
script, such as NODE_COUNT.

When upgrading from releases earlier than RabbitMQ-1.5.x, note that
the database schema has changed. When the RabbitMQ server detects the
presence of an old database, it moves it to a backup location, creates
a fresh, empty database, and logs a warning.

If your RabbitMQ installation contains important data, such as user
accounts, durable exchanges and queues, or persistent messages, then
we recommend you contact <A HREF="http://lists.rabbitmq.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rabbitmq-announce">support at rabbitmq.com</A> for assistance with the
upgrade.
