Subject: [rabbitmq-announce] RabbitMQ 3.0.0 released
Message-ID: <50AA195F.5060604@rabbitmq.com>

The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 3.0.0.

This release introduces dynamic, policy-based control of mirroring and 
federation, improves the user friendliness of clustering, adds support 
for per-message TTL, introduces plugins for web-STOMP and MQTT, and adds 
many smaller new features and bug fixes.

In addition, performance is improved in several cases. Most notably, 
mirrored queues are substantially faster.

See the release notes at:

for more information.

The new release can be downloaded from:

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion
list.

Regards,
                      The RabbitMQ Team
