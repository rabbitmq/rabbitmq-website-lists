Message-ID: <4A262568.1030901@lshift.net>

All,

RabbitMQ is now included in the Fedora Linux distribution. See 
https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/rabbitmq-server for the package 
details.

So, for all Fedora users RabbitMQ is now just a
   yum install rabbitmq-server
away :)

I'd like to thank the Fedora community, in particular Peter Lemenkov and 
Ruben Kerkhof, for their guidance in getting our RPM packages into shape 
for inclusion.


Regards,

Matthias.

Subject: [rabbitmq-announce] RabbitMQ 1.6.0 release
Message-ID: <4A38D4ED.6020501@lshift.net>

The RabbitMQ team is pleased to announce the release of RabbitMQ 1.6.0

This release has 'beta' status and introduces a number of new features,
such as prefetch count limiting, headers exchanges, fine-grained access
control, and alternate exchanges. There are also improvements to
performance and stability under high load, improved compatibility with
other software (such as ejabberd and PowerShell), and a number of small
bug fixes.

For details see the attached release notes.

Binary and source distributions of the new release can be found in the
usual place, at http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html

We recommend that all users of earlier versions of RabbitMQ upgrade to
this latest release.

As always, we welcome any questions, bug reports, and other feedback on
this release, as well as general suggestions for features and
enhancements in future releases. Mail us via the RabbitMQ discussion
list at rabbitmq-discuss at lists.rabbitmq.com, or directly at
info at rabbitmq.com.


Regards,

The RabbitMQ Team
